Olivia Stewart's mind was spinning as she tried to juggle the chaos that seemed to have descended on her life all at once. First, there was the whole fiasco with the wedding dress fitting that Isabella Peterson had arranged as a surprise, and now here she was, trying to manage an impromptu search-and-rescue mission for little Tommy, who had gone AWOL after a disagreement over taking his medicine.

The day had started with Olivia playing the role of a gentle persuader, coaxing Tommy to take his syrupy medicine. But Tommy, being the spirited kid he was, had other plans. "No way, Auntie Liv! I don't want it!" he protested, his little face scrunched up in defiance.

When gentle persuasion failed, Olivia tried a firmer approach, "Tommy, you need to take your medicine to get better. Otherwise, Auntie won't be happy with you."

Tommy's response was to bolt, leaving Olivia scrambling after him, her heart in her throat as she imagined all the places he could have disappeared to on the sprawling estate.

Amidst all this, Lucas Wright had appeared with a message from Isabella. "Olivia, Mr. Peterson wants you to go to the shop to try on your wedding dress. He's waiting there for you."

Startled, Olivia's first instinct was disbelief. "He's back? Now?" But with Tommy missing, she could hardly focus on wedding bells.

After what felt like an eternity of searching, Olivia finally found Tommy nestled among the tulips, fast asleep and covered in dirt. Relief washed over her, only to be replaced by concern when she realized he was burning up with fever.

As she rushed Tommy back to the castle, cradling him carefully, Olivia's mind was a whirlwind of worry and exhaustion. She barely had time to process the doctor's hurried updates about her other two children, the twins, who were also under the weather.

Just as she was about to reach her breaking point, Isabella stormed into the room, his face a mix of frustration and hurt. "Are you even planning to marry me, Olivia?" he demanded, his voice a sharp edge.

Olivia, drained and frazzled, could only manage a tired apology. "I'm sorry, Isabella. Tommy's sick, and he needs me right now."

His eyes flicked to Tommy sleeping beside her, his expression unreadable. "So, this is it? You'd sacrifice everything for this child?"

Olivia's heart ached with the weight of his words. "It's not like that, Isabella. I just... I need to make sure he's okay."

Isabella's frustration was palpable, but instead of escalating, he turned away, leaving Olivia with the echo of his footsteps.

As the doctor finally arrived to tend to Tommy, Olivia felt the exhaustion hit her full force. She knew she had to check on the twins, but her heart was torn. She wanted to be everything for everyone, but at that moment, she felt like she was barely holding it all together.

Isabella's parting words lingered in the air, a reminder of the delicate balance she was trying to maintain between love, duty, and the overwhelming desire to keep her family safe and happy.
