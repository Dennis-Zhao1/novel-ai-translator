Olivia Stewart's child from back then—is he alive? 

Alexander Peterson felt a sharp pang in his heart as he watched the regret and pain in Olivia Stewart's eyes. Why did Isabella Peterson deserve all the good things? He had taken away Alexander’s woman, and now he was stealing her heart too! 

Why was Isabella Peterson born the legitimate heir while Alexander bore the shameful title of an illegitimate child, forced to keep his head down in the vast Peterson Group? Jealousy, a wild and consuming emotion, was gnawing away at him, driving him to madness. 

In a moment of rage, Alexander pushed Olivia away. “No! I didn’t do it! Stop blaming everything on me!” he shouted, his voice filled with bitterness. “Isabella Peterson got you pregnant and then ran off, leaving you as a laughingstock for the whole town. Have you forgotten?” 

“How could I, Alexander Peterson, the rightful heir of the Peterson Group, be interested in someone used by another?” 

Olivia leaned against the cold wall, listening to Alexander’s harsh words. Her eyes were dry, but her heart was weeping, the tears seeping into the countless cracks within. Despite everything, a strange sense of relief washed over her when Alexander denied the accusations. She had been true to Isabella Peterson from the start, and that was enough for her. 

“The past was my fault,” she admitted softly. “You can curse me all you want. But I don’t understand—if Isabella Peterson could have children back then, why can’t he now?” 

Alexander froze, his mind racing. Why was he in such a hurry to distance himself when he had already pinned the blame on Isabella? Olivia was smart—might she figure something out? A fleeting hardness crossed his eyes, quickly replaced by a calculating glint. Olivia was Isabella’s weakness, the perfect tool if used correctly. 

Pushing his glasses up, Alexander looked at Olivia with a touch of sympathy. “You know, Isabella’s health wasn’t great before. After his heart surgery, he became quite the wild one, injuring himself in the process.” 

Injured… himself? Olivia’s heart skipped a beat, her face scrunching up in confusion. Wasn’t Isabella supposed to be quite disciplined? Doubt crept in as she glanced at Alexander, catching a fleeting glimpse of cunning in his eyes. But when she looked again, all she saw was a soft smile. 

Suppressing her unease, Olivia huffed, “No wonder he doesn’t trust me!” 

Alexander hadn’t expected her to look up so suddenly, and his expression nearly slipped. But hearing her words, he relaxed again, dismissing his paranoia. She was just a naive girl, after all. 

Pushing his glasses once more, Alexander gently probed, “You don’t seem worried?” 

“Why should I be? It’s his fault for being reckless!” Olivia replied with a pout, oblivious to Alexander’s relief as he patted her shoulder like a big brother. 

“You should be more understanding. You and Isabella have had sweet times together. Now he’s sick, you shouldn’t abandon him!” he advised in a brotherly tone. “He’s avoiding treatment. Maybe I can clear up the misunderstandings, and you can go back to him and help him out?” 

Olivia considered his words. Staying with Alexander wasn’t a long-term plan. He had saved her, but who knew when he might cave to pressure and betray her? If she could return to Isabella, despite any grudges, he’d never truly harm her. 

Just as she was about to agree, doubt held her back. Isabella’s supposed condition didn’t add up. Recalling those evenings when he seemed anything but incapacitated, Olivia blushed at the memories, quickly lowering her head. 

“I’m not going back!” she declared stubbornly. 

“You don’t want to make things right with him? Don’t you want to have a child together?” Alexander pressed on. If Olivia agreed too readily, he might have found a way to excuse himself. But seeing her hesitation, he saw the potential to turn her into a valuable pawn. 

**Elsewhere, at the Azure Villa...**

Isabella Peterson stood by the window, still simmering over his recent diagnosis. His tall silhouette merged with the night as his phone lit up—a message from the investigator he’d sent to look into the child. 

Infertility was a fact, and the child must be Alexander and Olivia’s. There was no doubt. Yet here he was, still searching for the child’s whereabouts for them! A wry smile twisted his lips as he hovered over the delete button, but he paused and opened the message instead. 

His eyebrows furrowed deeply as he read the report. Olivia had suffered from severe depression back then. Further investigation revealed a medical record of contraindicated medication for pregnant women. His investigator discovered that Olivia had given birth to a boy, only for James Cook to secretly sell the child. 

The trauma had triggered Olivia’s depression, causing her to forget the heartbreaking past selectively. Hypnosis hadn’t helped her recall those events, indicating the profound impact of losing her child. However, this selective amnesia had allowed her depression to heal. 

Isabella read the brief report repeatedly, barely maintaining his composure as he pieced together the truth. Olivia had indeed given birth, and the child was alive—but it wasn’t his! 

Recalling the scene in the garden that afternoon, Isabella’s hands clenched into fists, veins bulging. Alexander would pay dearly for this! 

Breathing deeply to calm his fury, Isabella had learned to control his temper over the years. “Lucas Wright!” he called, his voice low and deadly. 

Lucas stepped from the shadows, bowing to Isabella’s commanding presence. “Yes, sir?” 

“Find the child and ensure he’s well taken care of!” 

“Understood, sir!” Lucas vanished into the night with a swift nod. 

Isabella, seething with dark energy, gripped a nearby porcelain cup, shattering it with a single squeeze. The time for action was now. 

Alexander had been making moves since returning to the Peterson Group, always eyeing the family fortune. Isabella had considered him a minor annoyance, focusing on building his tech company and thriving in the entertainment industry. Apart from keeping an eye on crucial departments, he’d mostly ignored Alexander. But daring to meddle with his woman was crossing a line. 

The night passed without sleep. The next morning, Isabella opened the door to find Alexander’s deceptively friendly smile waiting. Isabella had no patience for this sly and malicious half-brother. 

“What do you want?” Isabella asked coldly, raising an indifferent eyebrow. 

Alexander adjusted his glasses, speaking warmly. “Your woman’s been staying with me.” 

“Hmm,” Isabella hummed noncommittally, showing no reaction, his deep eyes calm and steady. 

Alexander hadn’t expected such composure, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes behind his glasses. “Aren’t you curious about what happened while she was with me?” 

Isabella shot him a disdainful look, his lips curling in a mocking smile. “What else besides the usual drama?” 

Alexander, unfazed by Isabella’s indifference, quickly got to the point. “It seems you’ve matured in your years away. If Olivia Stewart returns to you, I’ll be relieved!” 

“Olivia Stewart?” Isabella echoed, a cold chuckle escaping him. “I believe my mother only had one child!” 

Alexander’s face paled, struggling to maintain his facade of warmth. Isabella’s reminder of his illegitimacy stung deeply. One day, he swore, he’d crush Isabella beneath his heel. 

Masking his malice with a casual gesture, Alexander smiled amiably. “Your sharp tongue hasn’t changed! But I’m used to it by now.” 

“I’m here to return Olivia Stewart, intact and safe,” Alexander declared. 

Hearing Olivia’s name from Alexander’s mouth again, Isabella’s patience wore thin. He shot a piercing glare at Alexander. “You dare call her by name?” 

“Oops, my bad! Just a habit,” Alexander laughed it off, subtly needling Isabella once more. 

Isabella’s fists curled tightly, suppressing his rage. 

Alexander handed over a small memory card. “I know you’re distrustful, especially of women. But you’ve misunderstood Olivia Stewart. This contains the full footage from that night and everything after I brought her back.” 

Isabella didn’t reach for it, merely watching Alexander coldly. 

Placing the card on a nearby railing, Alexander smiled gently. “I hope once you’ve seen it, Olivia Stewart can return to your side. She’s not happy with me.” 

And with that, he left, leaving Isabella alone with the memory card and a storm of emotions.
