Am I Being Too Harsh?

Olivia Stewart looked up and noticed the white strands in Jasper White's hair. Those white hairs stood out like needles piercing into her heart.

She quietly turned her face away.

Even if Jasper and Grace White genuinely repented, as long as Olivia couldn't let go of her past grievances, she couldn't soften her heart.

Grace White bowed to Olivia Stewart. "Olivia, from now on, I'll make some soup every day and leave it at the door. You can have the help pick it up. Drink it when you feel like it, or pour it out if you don't."

Olivia felt a mix of frustration and pity at Grace's humble demeanor. 

Once, they had schemed tirelessly to claim her as their daughter to benefit from her connection to Isabella Peterson. Now, whether out of genuine remorse or a need to fill a void, they wanted her back in their lives using the humblest of approaches.

Perhaps even Jasper and Grace White didn't realize that by lowering themselves before Olivia, they were inadvertently provoking her guilt, a subtle form of coercion.

Olivia stood up, looked at them firmly, and said, "What's done is done. We can't change the past, so there's no point dwelling on it. You've shown enough sincerity over the past three years at the ranch. There's no need to act so pitifully around me anymore."

"Honestly, I don't hate you as much as before, but I don't feel like getting close to you either. I hope we can just be like strangers. Your humility only makes me feel uncomfortable; it doesn't spark any familial affection."

Her words were blunt but clear. Everyone understands logic, but emotions take time.

Jasper and Grace exchanged a glance, muttered an apology, and left, looking rather defeated.

As they walked out, Olivia suddenly called out, "Is your kidney disease better?"

Grace paused, turned back, and nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, it's much better. Thank you for your concern!"

It was just a casual question, Olivia told herself.

She furrowed her brow, puzzled, "Did you find a donor?"

"No," Grace said, looking embarrassed. "Back then, I was wrong to think of taking your kidney. Once I knew you were my daughter, I regretted it so much. I didn't want to undergo the transplant anymore, but I wasn't ready to leave without you forgiving me or calling me 'mom,' so I cooperated with the doctors. Jasper supported me through it, and miraculously, I got better."

Olivia watched Grace's face light up with maternal warmth and looked away, feeling a pang in her heart.

She never doubted the power of the mind over health. If she could be Grace's emotional anchor, it was perhaps a small repayment for bringing her into the world.

She gave Grace a gentle smile. "I'm doing well now. You're getting older; maybe you should use your money to travel the world."

It was probably the first time Grace had heard Olivia speak to her so kindly. Both she and Jasper were visibly moved.

Olivia waved her hand, signaling the help to escort them out. She worried that if she softened, the emotional investment might backfire if they hurt her again.

Jasper and Grace didn't bother Olivia again afterward, except for the daily delivery of a carefully wrapped thermos to the gate.

At dinner, Olivia eyed the thermos with a frown. Lucas Wright, standing nearby, offered, "Olivia, if you don't like it, I can tell them to stop bringing it."

Olivia sighed. "Just leave it there for a few days. She'll get the message."

But Grace continued bringing soup, rain or shine.

From the security cameras, Olivia saw Grace looking at the row of untouched thermoses with a forlorn expression. Grace would place a new one and retrieve the old ones, probably advising the guards to drink the soup while it's hot.

Olivia had never experienced genuine maternal love before. Now she was being pampered by the same person who had hurt her deeply. It was a complex feeling.

"Feeling soft-hearted?" A deep voice came from behind, and Olivia turned to see Isabella Peterson standing there.

"Isabella..." Olivia pouted childishly, leaning into his embrace.

Isabella stroked her head gently. "What's on your mind?"

Olivia looked up at his strong jawline. "Isabella, if I had someone kick over those thermoses, would you think I'm too harsh?"

Isabella chuckled, his smile warm and disarming. "Silly, you wouldn't do that because you care too much."

"Even if you did, it would be for their own good. I know you want them to have their own lives, free from the burden of guilt."

"You're annoying!" Olivia playfully punched his chest. This man knew her too well.

Isabella lifted her chin, looking deep into her eyes. "If it bothers you, speak up. If you don't want to see them, send them away. If you want to forgive, then forgive. Don't torment yourself."

Olivia bit her lip, silent.

Isabella's lips curled with amusement. "How about I come up with a win-win solution for you? Something that keeps you from feeling troubled and keeps them happily busy?"

Olivia's eyes widened. "What do you have in mind?"

"How about we have another set of twins and let them babysit?" he suggested cheekily.

"You're terrible!" Olivia was both embarrassed and amused, playfully hitting his chest again.

Isabella laughed heartily, as if being tickled, enjoying the moment.

Once Olivia had vented enough, he caught her small hand, kissed it lightly, and asked, "Does it hurt?"

She blushed, pulling her hand back. "Isabella..."

He wrapped his arms around her, resting his scruffy chin on her head. "Olivia, don't worry too much about it. Just do what makes you happy. No matter what it is, I'll always support you."

Finally hearing those words made Olivia smile, a mischievous gleam in her eyes.

"Really? Isabella, I can do anything? You're not lying?"

"Of course! Have I ever gone back on my word? Even if it means serving you personally, just ask!" Isabella declared boldly.

"Then..." Olivia turned to him, grinning from ear to ear. "I want you to sing a song for me!"

Isabella's perfect face fell. "You're not a kid. Why do you want me to sing?"

Then, with a mischievous glint, he suggested, "How about we go to the bedroom? I'll work out while you sing, and I promise you'll be singing joyfully!"

"You're impossible!" Olivia pouted, turning away.

Isabella tilted his head to look at her. "Are you mad?"

"Hmph!" She turned away again. "You said I could do anything, but you're just teasing me! Isabella, if you can't fulfill such a small request, aren't you afraid I'll get depressed?"

Isabella laughed. 

Was this the face of someone who might be depressed?

But he knew the consequences of upsetting her could affect his own comfort.

His face showed rare indecision, but after a few seconds, he began to hum softly, "Under the cherry blossom tree that year, your silhouette etched in my heart, the light in your eyes..."

His deep voice carried a tender, mesmerizing tone.
