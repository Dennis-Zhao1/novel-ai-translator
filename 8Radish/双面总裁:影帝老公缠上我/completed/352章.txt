"Learn to Forgive"  

Olivia Stewart's eyes widened in an instant. Her hand hovered over the mouse, poised to close the video window, but she couldn't bring herself to click. Instead, she zoomed in on the figure holding an umbrella in the pouring rain. Through the thick curtain of rain, the figure gradually became clear.  

Once again, Olivia's eyes widened, her mouth slightly agape in surprise. The large black umbrella obscured most of the figure's upper body, but she immediately recognized that it wasn't Grace Martin. This person was much taller than Grace.  

Who else would brave such a downpour to bring soup? The answer was obvious—White Pine.  

Why wasn't it Grace? A sense of unease crept into Olivia's heart as she turned and dashed outside.  

Downstairs in the foyer, Isabella Peterson was just slipping into her slippers when she saw Olivia running out frantically. "Olivia! Where are you going?" she called out, confused.  

"I'll be right back!" Olivia's voice trailed off in the rain.  

Isabella, seeing Olivia rush into the rain without an umbrella, quickly followed, throwing her jacket over Olivia's head. "What’s so urgent? You'll catch a cold!"  

"I'm fine. I'll explain later!" Olivia replied, her voice hurried as she splashed through the rain.  

A bodyguard ran after them, handing over an umbrella. Isabella took it and held it over Olivia, wrapping an arm around her to keep her steady as they ran.  

"Olivia, no matter what's going on, don't panic. I'm here with you, okay?" Isabella reassured, though Olivia was too focused to hear her. She just wanted to reach the gate and ask the elderly man why Grace hadn't come today.  

With Isabella's help, they reached the gate quickly. White Pine, holding the black umbrella, was placing a fresh pot of hot soup down, just like Grace always did. He picked up the empty thermos from the day before, shaking his head with a forlorn expression as he turned to leave.  

"Wait!" Olivia called out, stopping him in his tracks. He turned, eyes wide with shock at seeing Olivia in the rain, and the thermos slipped from his grasp.  

"Thud!"  

The thermos hit the ground with a dull sound, and White Pine snapped back to reality, looking at Olivia with concern. "Olivia, why are you out here in this weather? You'll catch a cold!"  

Olivia stepped closer, her eyes red, sniffing as she asked, "If you knew the rain was so heavy, why did you come?"  

White Pine hesitated, his gaze falling to the spilled soup on the ground. His eyes carried a sorrow that was hard to put into words. It was clear Olivia hadn't touched the soup. Though he and Grace knew she never drank it, seeing it untouched still stung.  

Like a hidden wound, it hurt less when you didn't see it. But when it was ripped open right in front of you...  

White Pine's hand trembled slightly. The broken thermos lay shattered at his feet, the soup mingling with the rain. Even though it was yesterday's soup, the aroma still lingered in the air.  

Olivia sniffed again, a tearful smile on her face. "Her soup-making has only gotten better."  

White Pine's eyes lit up with hope. "Would you like to try some? I brought fresh soup today!"  

It was hard to refuse such a sincere offer, even from a stranger. Olivia smiled gently, reaching out, "Sure!"  

White Pine, delighted, dashed to retrieve the thermos outside the gate, presenting it to Olivia with joy. "You must try it! It's freshly made and still hot!"  

As the gate slowly opened between them, Olivia didn't take the thermos but instead took the umbrella from Isabella, holding it over White Pine's head. The sudden shade from the rain brightened White Pine's spirits.  

White Pine looked at Olivia, tears of gratitude in his eyes, his lips trembling with unspoken words. Olivia held the umbrella for him and took the thermos from his hands, "Come in and rest for a bit."  

Normally, such an invitation from Olivia would have thrilled White Pine, but today—  

"No, I need to get back..." He glanced at Olivia with longing, swallowing his words.  

Up close, Olivia noticed how much White Pine had aged recently. Lines of worry etched across his face. Was it because of her? Olivia felt a pang of guilt.  

Gazing out at the steady rain, she bit her lip and softly asked, "Why didn't she come?"  

White Pine thought Olivia was blaming Grace and quickly defended, "Don’t blame her! It’s my fault. I insisted on coming because of the bad weather!"  

Even someone as stubborn as White Pine knew how to care for his wife. Maybe Olivia shouldn't judge them so harshly anymore. Perhaps it was time to give them a chance.  

Making up her mind, Olivia said quietly, "You don't have to bring soup every day. It's too much trouble."  

Too much care felt unfamiliar, and Olivia swallowed the rest of her words. White Pine's face fell, looking like a child about to cry.  

"Olivia, let us do this. We don’t know what else we can do for you. The soup is really good for you!"  

"Before you had the twins, you were kidnapped for half a month, living in a basement. When you finally got out, you were rushed to the hospital in the cold. Chloe Wright said that kind of cold could cause long-term issues, difficult to treat!"  

Though Olivia remained calm, her heart was in turmoil. After having the twins, there was a time when she and Isabella were especially close. Isabella had been cautious about her health, but after returning from the ranch, they hadn't been as careful, and good news never seemed to come. Could this condition be the reason?  

Even though Olivia didn't want more children, learning about this condition made her feel incomplete.  

Seeing her expression, White Pine felt apologetic. "Chloe told me not to tell you, fearing it would stress you out. She hoped you’d drink the soup without knowing, and it would help."  

"She’s worked hard on this recipe, making it both nutritious and tasty. You should really try it!"  

Under White Pine's eager gaze, Olivia opened the thermos, took a spoonful, and tasted it. "It’s really good!" she praised sincerely.  

White Pine beamed like a child receiving candy. "Drink more! I’ll bring it every day!"  

Olivia closed the thermos and handed it to Isabella. "No need to make it every day. Just now and then. Call me when it's ready, and I’ll have someone pick it up."  

White Pine insisted, "Let me bring it. Even if it’s just a little, you should drink it daily. It's good for you."  

What he didn't say was that delivering the soup meant he might get to see her and exchange a few words.  

Seeing his determination, Olivia relented. "Alright, if you insist. But not in weather like today. I won’t drink it if you do."  

"Okay," White Pine agreed, like a child caught misbehaving.  

Olivia noticed a flicker of sadness in his eyes. She furrowed her brow, asking cautiously, "Is she alright?"  

Even though Olivia was trying to forgive, she couldn't bring herself to say "mom" just yet. Not for Grace, nor for White Pine.  

White Pine understood and didn't mind. He hesitated, "Nothing serious."  

His evasion made Olivia more suspicious. "Is she sick?"  

White Pine avoided her gaze, "No, not really."
