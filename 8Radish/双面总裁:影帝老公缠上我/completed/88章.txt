Olivia Stewart just broke someone's leg.

It all happened in a flash. Olivia Stewart turned her face to the side, aimed a kick at Sarah Moore's kneecap, andâ€”BAM!

"Ahhh!"

With a scream, Sarah Moore fell backward, conveniently landing on a metal prop box. There was a cracking sound, and she hit the ground, her leg now sporting a long, thin cut with blood trickling down.

"My leg! Someone help, my bone's broken!"

Sarah Moore's face went pale as she lay on the ground, her cries echoing with despair.

"Sis, it was just acting! Didn't you know you were supposed to fake it?" Sophie Cook blurted out, immediately realizing she might've said the wrong thing. She quickly covered her mouth, glanced nervously at Olivia, and whispered, "Sorry, sis, I was too blunt!"

Everyone around turned their attention to Olivia, their eyes filled with blame. Olivia clenched and unclenched her fists by her sides, casting a slightly apologetic look at Sarah.

The moment Sarah's hand came flying at her, Olivia saw the intent in her eyes. So, she dodged and fought back. But she never thought Sarah would land on the metal box and end up with a fracture. It was an accident, but now everyone was holding Olivia responsible.

"What are you all standing around for? Help get her to the hospital!" shouted the teacher, snapping everyone out of their shock. Two guys rushed over to help Sarah Moore up.

Touching her made Sarah scream even louder. Eventually, they managed to lift her like a makeshift stretcher and carry her out.

"Sarah Moore must be in so much pain," Sophie Cook whispered, watching the retreating figure with tears in her eyes. "She looks so pitiful."

"Blame this woman! So what if she insulted you? You insulted her back, didn't you? But you actually hurt her!"

"She shouldn't be in our class!"

"Yeah! And she's the lead actress? How'd she even get that role?"

The remaining classmates were vocal with their criticism. A few angry guys even started rolling up their sleeves and approaching. Sophie stepped in front of Olivia, spreading her arms protectively, "You can't hurt my sister!"

Olivia gently pulled Sophie aside, reassuring her, "It's okay, they won't do anything."

"You just got here and forgot about faking it. I don't think anyone will blame you, but..." Sophie looked at Olivia with concern, "You really broke Sarah's leg. What now? Plus, you two were arguing so fiercely, anyone would think you did it on purpose!"

Olivia rubbed her forehead. Was Sophie worried or just adding fuel to the fire?

Sophie's words made the crowd even more hostile, demanding Olivia leave the film academy.

Sophie burst into tears, "Did I say something wrong again? Don't make my sister leave! It's my fault! If anyone should go, it should be me! My sister's about to star alongside a top actor, you'll ruin her career!"

"Someone like her deserves to be ruined!"

"Yeah, why should she play the lead? Don't tarnish our idol!"

The room was filled with angry voices, loud enough to drown out any defense.

Olivia smirked slightly. How many of these defenders were actually upset for Sarah, and how many were just jealous? Only they knew.

Sophie tugged at Olivia's sleeve, whispering, "Sis, we should go before they get angrier and really come after you!"

Though whispered, many heard her clearly. Someone even shouted, "Let's get her! They can't punish us all!"

"Sis!"

Sophie threw herself over Olivia protectively.

"Relax, it'll be fine," Olivia said calmly, facing the angry crowd.

She reassured Sophie with a pat, then gently moved her aside, "This isn't your problem. Stand aside and stay safe."

"No, I won't!"

"Listen!"

Olivia's voice was firm, and Sophie reluctantly stepped back, worry etched on her face.

Olivia turned to the tense crowd, her face calm and collected. "Firstly, I apologize to Sarah Moore. I didn't expect her to hit the box and break her leg."

"Don't try to dodge responsibility, we all saw you kick her!"

Olivia smiled slightly, "You know the truth, I know the truth, and Sarah knows the truth. The academy will investigate and handle this fairly. If you cause trouble here, you might not be staying either."

"Is that a threat?"

"Everyone knows I'm here for a short-term training from a major film company. I could leave anytime. Even if my reputation is ruined, they'd clear my name or pay me a hefty sum in compensation. But you, stepping out of these gates might mean the end of your entertainment careers."

Olivia crossed her arms, her gaze challenging. It was clear: she had support, and wasn't afraid to use it.

Some began to rethink their stance, realizing they had more to lose. Gradually, they stepped back.

"You think the academy will expel us all?" one guy shouted, but when he turned, he found himself alone in the front, sheepishly rubbing his head.

Olivia chuckled, her eyes shining with amusement. "You're not bad looking, but the academy has plenty of attractive people. You know how hard it was to get in, right? Remember what you went through?"

Faces paled, some even trying to quietly leave.

"Hold on, I'm not done!" Olivia continued, "I regret Sarah's injury, but I'm not sorry for defending myself!"

Everyone paused, waiting for her to continue.

"I have a principle: treat me well, and I'll treat you better; wrong me, and I will retaliate. You've studied acting longer than I have. Didn't you see what happened?"

Olivia's voice grew firmer, her gaze steady. "Sarah tried to slap me for real. If I didn't kick back, I'd be the one with a bruised face on the ground!"

Even after dodging, Olivia had scratches on her face from Sarah's nails, still stinging.

"Can't they see my injuries? Are they blind?"

"Sis!" Sophie exclaimed, noticing Olivia's face, her eyes tearing up, "How serious is it? Sarah deserved it! But sis, your face, how will you act?"

Was it that bad? Olivia's heart sank. She felt the sting but hadn't realized the extent of the damage.

"Sis, let's go to the nurse!" Sophie urged.

A girl from the crowd hesitantly offered, "I have some medicine from last time. Do you want it?"

Sophie nodded eagerly, "Hurry, the cuts are drying, it'll scar!"

The girl fetched the medicine, and Sophie prepared it.

"Sis, sit down, I'll apply it for you!"

Face injuries were no joke, and Olivia sat down, letting Sophie work.

As Sophie applied the medicine, the smell hit Olivia, making her instinctively pull away.

"No!" Olivia stopped her, turning her face aside. The cotton swab fell, and disappointment flashed in Sophie's eyes.
