The Heart's Burden

Tina's recovery was progressing well, but ever since she was rescued, she hadn't uttered a single word. At first, Olivia Stewart thought Tina was just traumatized and that with enough love and care, she'd eventually let go of the unpleasant memories. Every day, Olivia tried her best to keep Tina entertained and happy.

However, Tina's response was unexpectedly cold, even showing a hint of sarcasm when Olivia accidentally referred to herself as "Aunt Liv." That look in Tina's eyes was like she was watching a clown perform, leaving Olivia feeling uneasy.

Growing up in an orphanage, Tina was already quieter than most kids her age. After everything she had been through, she seemed to have matured beyond her years. Olivia began to suspect that Tina needed professional help.

After a while, Tina was healthy enough to leave the hospital. Olivia was concerned that Tina might resist seeing a psychologist, so she arranged for a pediatric psychologist, Dr. Huang, to meet them in the hospital's garden instead of the consultation room.

"Tina, this is Dr. Huang," Olivia introduced her.

Tina didn't respond, merely glancing at Dr. Huang with an icy demeanor. Dr. Huang, unfazed, knelt down to Tina's level and said kindly, "Hello, Tina. Youâ€™re quite the handsome young man!"

She reached out to pat Tina's head, but before she could touch him, Tina's expression turned fierce, and he bit down on Dr. Huang's hand.

"Tina!" Olivia cried out in alarm, but it was too late. Dr. Huang's hand bore five deep purple bite marks.

Olivia, slightly angry, raised her voice, "Tina, that was not okay! Apologize to Dr. Huang!"

But Tina just made a face at Dr. Huang, then returned to his indifferent expression, ignoring Olivia's reprimand entirely.

Feeling helpless, Olivia bowed slightly to Dr. Huang, "I'm so sorry for the trouble. Should you get that treated?"

"No need," Dr. Huang waved it off. "The skin isn't broken. I'll handle it myself later. This child has clearly been through a lot and is wary of strangers."

"Yes," Olivia nodded, feeling at a loss.

She hadn't told Dr. Huang all the details about what Tina had endured at the hands of Alexander Peterson, worried it might affect Tina further. Dr. Huang pondered for a moment, "It seems outsiders might find it hard to reach him. Since he seems to trust you more, perhaps you could help with his therapy?"

"Me?" Olivia felt uncertain. She was already in need of guidance herself; how could she possibly help someone else?

Dr. Huang encouraged her, "Don't worry. I'll guide you through it. You can ask me anything."

Olivia hesitated, "But I..."

She wanted to confide in Dr. Huang about her own struggles, but with Tina nearby, she swallowed her words.

Suddenly, Tina turned and ran.

"Tina! Tina!" Olivia apologized to Dr. Huang and rushed after him.

Tina ran back to his room, climbed onto the bed, and pulled the covers over his head, hiding completely.

Alarmed, Olivia tried to pull the covers down gently, "Tina, don't do this. You'll suffocate!"

Tina held onto the covers tightly, refusing to uncover his head despite Olivia's efforts.

Worried he might actually suffocate, Olivia softly patted him through the blanket and coaxed, "If you're upset with me, I'm sorry. If you don't want me around, I'll leave. But please, uncover your head. You'll hurt yourself."

After speaking, Olivia left the room.

Standing outside, she peeked through the door crack and saw Tina slowly pulling the blanket down, his face flushed red from lack of air. Poor kid.

Olivia sighed and shook her head.

She hoped that Tina would feel better after some time alone, but to her dismay, he refused to eat lunch. Even when Olivia tried to feed him herself, he turned his face away coldly.

Frustrated, Olivia took a large dose of calming medication to steady her own nerves, determined to help Tina through his psychological troubles first.

Olivia consulted Dr. Huang, but the complexities of psychological counseling were not something she could grasp overnight, especially with Tina now resistant even to her.

By evening, Tina still wouldn't eat, and Olivia was at her wit's end.

The expert suggested, "Maybe try changing his environment?"

Olivia asked Tina, "Do you feel unwell, Tina?"

Tina continued to play with his toys, as if he hadn't heard her.

Olivia persisted, "How about we go home?"

Tina's hand paused momentarily, then resumed playing.

Noticing this subtle reaction, Olivia realized he had heard her. Seeing no objection, she arranged for his discharge and took him back home.

Their home was filled with the scent of a delicious meal prepared by the chef.

Olivia sat Tina at the dining table next to her. "Tina, these are all your favorite dishes. Dig in!" she urged, smiling and placing food on his plate.

Tina hesitantly picked up his chopsticks. As stubborn as he was, a hungry kid couldn't resist good food.

"Go ahead," Olivia encouraged, handing him a bowl of soup.

"Ma...ma..." The twins, brought in by the nanny, babbled. They hadn't seen much of Olivia in days and were excited to see her.

But this time, Olivia didn't rush to hold them. Her attention was on Tina, who hadn't eaten for two meals, and she was genuinely worried about him.

Seeing Olivia's focus on him, Tina felt a bit better and finally took a bite of the delicious crispy ribs.

Mmm, not bad!

The chef's cooking was always top-notch, and after skipping two meals, Tina was quite hungry.

He soon finished the ribs and moved on to a meatball, munching happily.

Olivia was delighted and quickly filled his plate with more food, gently wiping his mouth as she said, "Eat slowly, don't choke."

This time, Tina didn't resist.

Olivia was happily watching over Tina when she heard the butler greet someone at the door, "Good evening, Master!"

Olivia turned to see Isabella Peterson entering, and her face lit up with a smile. She stood to greet him, "Isabella, you're back!"

"Yes," Isabella handed his coat to a servant and walked towards Olivia, looking a bit tired and worn out.

"What's wrong?" Olivia asked, concerned.

Isabella sighed, "We lost Alexander Peterson again! The cave has too many exit points. We had him cornered, but who knew there was a passage leading to an underground river?"

"Clatter!" Tina's chopsticks fell from his hand, knocking over a dish.

Olivia quickly signaled Isabella to stop talking and turned to comfort Tina, "Tina, don't be scared. There are plenty of people here to protect you. That bad person won't get in. Don't worry!"

Tina's big eyes were filled with fear, and his body trembled as he suddenly ran upstairs.

When Olivia caught up, he had already hidden under the covers again, cocooned tightly.

This was a clear sign of deep insecurity!

Olivia clenched her fists tightly.

Alexander Peterson, you monster! How could you?

Feeling a surge of frustration and anger, Olivia took deep breaths to calm herself. Once composed, she gently patted Tina through the blanket, soothing him with soft words.

Tina stayed under the covers until he was nearly out of breath, finally peeking out when he could no longer breathe properly.

Concerned for his safety, Olivia stayed by his side all night.

Meanwhile, downstairs, Isabella held the twins, one in each arm, his dark eyes staring up towards Tina's room, calm and steady.

Back at home, Tina still didn't speak, but his mood swings were noticeable. When Olivia focused solely on him, he was well-behaved, but the moment she turned her attention to the twins, he would sulk and throw his toys in anger.

Life seemed to revert to its previous routine. Olivia found herself constantly occupied with Tina, only visiting the twins after he fell asleep.

Isabella never showed any signs of annoyance, only concern for Olivia's well-being, and tried to spend more time with the twins himself.

The more he helped, the guiltier Olivia felt, and the more overwhelmed she became by her own emotions.

Before she knew it, she had finished a bottle of sedatives and secretly went to ask for more from Dr. Wang.

"Dr. Wang, do you have more of those pills from last time? Can I get another bottle?"

"What?" The doctor was surprised, nearly falling off his chair...
