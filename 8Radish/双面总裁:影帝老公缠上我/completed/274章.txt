Olivia Stewart's Welcome Party

Olivia Stewart stepped into the room with an air of elegance that left everyone momentarily speechless. She wore a silver, asymmetrical gown that hugged her figure just right, made from the softest fabric that shimmered subtly with every step she took. Her jewelry—simple yet exquisite diamond earrings and a matching necklace—complemented the tiny gems on her dress, creating a dazzling effect as she moved.

The gown's deep-V back tastefully revealed her smooth, porcelain-like skin, while her hair, swept up in a high bun, was secured with a minimalist crescent-shaped diamond clip. A few loose strands framed her youthful face, adding an extra touch of softness.

Olivia's large, bright eyes sparkled with intelligence and mischief, a striking contrast to her otherwise goddess-like appearance. Despite her undeniable allure, her clear eyes lent her an ethereal quality, as if she were a moonlit deity stepping out of a dream.

The lead designer couldn't help but smile and praise, "Miss Stewart, your sense of style is impeccable! The simpler the adornment, the more it highlights your ethereal aura. Too much glamor would only overshadow your true essence!"

Olivia gave a small, gracious smile, thanking them openly, "Thank you all for your hard work. You deserve a reward!" In truth, she wasn't particularly stylish; she just preferred simplicity over hassle.

Surrounded by her entourage, Olivia glided towards the grand ballroom of the Golden Plaza Hotel, where her welcome party was being held. As she approached the opulent entrance, she couldn't help but recall the time she had disrupted Isabella Peterson and Mia White's engagement party by pretending to be pregnant. Choosing this venue was a bold move by Jackson White, as if to deliberately ruffle Mia's feathers. How amusing!

Sure enough, Olivia spotted Mia standing at the entrance, her smile as stiff as cardboard. Upon seeing Olivia's stunning appearance, Mia's smile morphed into a grimace, barely masking her jealousy.

"Olivia, you look amazing," Mia managed to say through gritted teeth as she approached, trying to maintain her composure.

Olivia skillfully sidestepped Mia's attempt to hold her hand, responding politely but distantly, "I'd prefer if you just call me Olivia."

Mia's face paled, but remembering her father's stern warnings, she swallowed her anger. Taking a deep breath, she forced a smile more painful than a frown, "The party's about to start. Let me show you in."

Olivia smiled brightly and confidently walked into the ballroom. The atmosphere buzzed with admiration as whispers followed her every move.

"Wow, is that Olivia Stewart? She's stunning!"

"You don't recognize her? She's the lead in that hit series, 'Send an Angel to Love You'!"

"No wonder she looks familiar! She looks even more beautiful in person than on screen."

"Yeah, she's got that angelic face and a devilish figure, the perfect blend!"

As Olivia gracefully acknowledged familiar faces with nods and smiles, Mia maintained her strained grin, silently fuming. Olivia had not only stolen her fiancé but was now stealing the limelight. Yet, she had no choice but to welcome her with open arms.

Jackson White, along with Grace Martin, approached Olivia with warmth. "Olivia, you're finally back!" Jackson's eyes glistened with feigned emotion.

A master of theatrics, Olivia thought, offering a small smile in return. "Yes," she replied softly, avoiding calling him by any familial title.

Grace Martin's smile was equally forced, her eyes betraying occasional flashes of malice, as if she wished to devour Olivia but had to maintain a facade of friendliness. Olivia couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity for Grace and her daughter. Acting in such a high-stakes drama must be exhausting.

Unfortunately, Ethan King wasn't invited and missed out on witnessing this spectacle. Olivia silently cursed Jackson for being so petty. Unbeknownst to her, Jackson had invited Isabella Peterson, fearing that if Ethan and another rival clashed, the welcome party would be ruined.

"Chloe, take the kids and mingle," Jackson instructed Grace.

Grace, her eyes gleaming with calculation, gestured to Olivia. "Olivia, come with us to meet some of the city's elite!" she said, her voice annoyingly sweet.

One word from Grace calling herself "Aunt" sent a shiver down Olivia's spine. Thank goodness she didn't call herself "Mom," or Olivia might have gagged on the spot!

Mia, hearing the words "city elite," perked up immediately, flashing a genuine smile. She exchanged a quick glance with Grace, a silent understanding passing between them.

Grace excelled at socializing among the so-called elite, despite lacking other notable talents. Publicly supporting Olivia’s welcome party, she had, in secret, spread rumors about Olivia's mother’s scandalous past to the elite women present. What was meant to be a social introduction was actually a setup for humiliation.

Unaware of Grace and Mia's schemes, Olivia remained cautious, holding onto a glass of juice without drinking, wary of any tricks they might pull.

Grace led Olivia and Mia to the west side of the ballroom, where several high-society women gathered. After brief introductions, their gazes fixed on Olivia, filled with disdain and jealousy.

One woman eyed Olivia and remarked, "Oh, so this is the little daughter Mr. White is reuniting with today. She's quite a looker!"

Another chimed in, "Her mother must've been too. Otherwise, how could a maid climb into the master's bed?"

Olivia's face turned cold. So, this was Grace's game plan!

Grace feigned reprimanding the women, "Oh, come now, ladies, this is Olivia's special day. Let's be kind!" Her words rang hollow, as her eyes danced with satisfaction.

The women exchanged embarrassed glances, raising their glasses in mock apology, "Oh, sorry, we spoke too hastily!" Their insincerity was palpable, their eyes still laced with contempt.

Grace turned to Olivia with faux sympathy, "Don't mind them, Olivia. Aunt May's family, too, had a maid scandal, so they're a bit bitter."

Ah, a group of scorned women. Lovely!

Olivia swirled her juice, smiling charmingly, "No problem! Let them talk. After all, in the end, it's only the White family's reputation at stake!"

Grace's heart skipped a beat. She knew if Jackson found out about her sabotage, there'd be hell to pay. Yet, just standing by while Olivia took center stage was unbearable.

Olivia had no intention of eating anything at the party, wary of Grace's potential schemes. Holding a juice glass was merely for show.

Suddenly, commotion stirred at the entrance.

"Who is it? Such a fuss," people murmured, craning their necks.

Olivia remained seated, unimpressed. What could possibly be exciting about the White family?

But Mia, thrilled, waved at Olivia, "Come on, Olivia! The 'genius' is here with a surprise for you!"

Olivia didn't move, raising an eyebrow, "Genius?"

"Uh..." Mia hesitated, "I meant Oliver Phillips, our brother!"

A brother? A genius brother?

Olivia's curiosity piqued, she stood and smirked, "Let's see what your brother's up to. Your dad sure knows how to name his kids!"

The two made their way to the entrance, where they saw...
