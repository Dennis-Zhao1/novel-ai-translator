I Can't Keep This Secret Any Longer

"No! I can't die now! I haven’t even called her 'Mom' yet. How can I die?"

In the gray, lifeless eyes of Tommy, a small spark suddenly ignited—a flicker of light, like a candle about to go out. Desperately, he reached for the wound on his neck, remembering that the villain had said that the leg wound would take thirty minutes to bleed out, but the neck wound only ten.

His arm felt like it weighed a ton, and it took all his strength just to lift it, slapping it over his neck and pressing down with all his might. Sticky, warm blood oozed between his fingers.

Cold. So cold…

Everything around him seemed to drift away, blurring into a distant haze.

As he fell, Tommy's mouth finally opened. He struggled to form the words, whispering, "M...Mom..."

Meanwhile, over at the Stewart Estate, Olivia Stewart was in the kitchen, preparing dinner for the kids. Suddenly, she felt a sharp stab at her heart, as if pierced by a blade. She gasped for air, clutching her chest.

A maid rushed to her side. "Olivia, are you alright?"

Olivia waved her off. "I'm fine, probably just tired from all the wedding preparations."

The maid helped her to a chair. "You really should rest! With the wedding so close, you shouldn't be in the kitchen. When Mr. Stewart sees this, he’ll be worried sick!"

The maid’s chatter did little to ease Olivia's unease. She frowned, asking, "What time is it? Check with Lucas, why aren’t the kids back yet?"

The maid hurried off.

Outside, Lucas Wright was pacing anxiously, his face etched with worry. Earlier, he had received a call from the driver saying their car had a flat tire on the road and needed assistance. But before long, another call came—Tommy and Daisy were missing!

Isabella Peterson immediately went out to search and instructed Lucas to keep the news from Olivia. They managed to keep the situation under wraps, even keeping their youngest, Coco, from coming back to the estate. Isabella wanted to take Coco to a safe place, but he insisted on joining the search for his sister, claiming a twin's intuition would help him find her faster.

Lucas had been nervously waiting for over three hours now, with no word of the children. The sun had set, and he couldn't bear the thought of facing Olivia with the truth. He had told her Daisy wanted to go to an amusement park, but now that it was dark, that excuse wouldn't hold.

Just then, the maid came out of the kitchen. "Lucas, Olivia wants to know when the kids will be back."

"Very soon!" Lucas replied, frowning impatiently. Seeing the maid's puzzled look, he quickly added, "There was a landslide on the outskirts of the city, and they're stuck there. They'll be back soon! Just keep Olivia busy in the kitchen, okay?"

The maid hesitated. "But Olivia was just saying she felt unwell."

Lucas's heart skipped a beat. A sense of foreboding crept over him. "It's probably nothing. Just keep her distracted."

Sensing something was amiss, the maid nodded and headed back inside.

After preparing dinner, Olivia noticed the kids still hadn't returned, and even Isabella was nowhere to be seen. She stepped outside, looking at Lucas suspiciously.

Lucas repeated the landslide excuse. Olivia eyed him warily, noticing the concern etched on his face. "Lucas, is something wrong? Isabella wouldn't be out of contact if everything was fine."

Lucas waved his hands dismissively. "Nothing’s wrong! Mr. Stewart is just busy... you know."

Olivia wasn't convinced. "Lucas, I’m their mom. I have a right to know what's going on."

Realizing he couldn’t keep the secret any longer, Lucas scratched his head awkwardly. "But... Mr. Stewart didn't want me to tell you."

So there was something wrong!

Olivia became anxious. "Tell me now!"

Lucas stammered, "It's... it's..."

The sudden ring of his phone interrupted him. Lucas picked it up immediately. "Hello? They found them? At the hospital? Okay, we’re on our way!"

Hanging up, Lucas turned to Olivia, apologizing. "I'm sorry, Olivia. I lied to you earlier. The kids got lost, but they're found now, and they're at the hospital."

"At the hospital? Are they hurt? Who? How bad?" Olivia asked, already moving towards the door.

Lucas hurried after her, trying to reassure her. "Olivia, don’t worry. It’s nothing serious, just a routine check-up. Maybe a couple of scratches from the bushes."

Outside the estate, a car was already waiting. Olivia jumped in, wishing she could sprout wings and fly to her children.

On the way, Lucas explained the kidnapping situation briefly. Olivia was too worried about her children to ask for more details.

They reached the hospital in a rush. Olivia practically ran to the room.

"Daisy!" she cried as she opened the door, relieved to see her daughter’s familiar face.

"Mommy!" Daisy wailed, reaching out and falling into Olivia’s arms.

Holding her daughter’s small, trembling body, Olivia felt a wave of relief wash over her. She gently soothed Daisy, "It's okay now. Mommy’s here. Don’t be scared!"

After a while, Daisy calmed down and looked up. "Mommy, I wasn’t scared. I was brave. I even jumped from the car!"

"Jumped from the car?" Olivia’s eyes widened as she examined Daisy closely.

"Sweetie, are you alright?"

Lucas had mentioned the rescue, but not the details.

Daisy shook her head. "I’m fine. Just a few scratches. Mommy, blow on them, and they won’t hurt!"

Daisy showed her little leg with small scratches. Olivia leaned down, softly blowing on them, and Daisy smiled through her tears.

Olivia, still worried, checked Daisy over again. "How did you jump from the car?"

Daisy pouted. "Tommy pushed me out. There were bad people in the car. He said to hide in the bushes and count to five hundred before calling for help. He said he’d jump too, but he never came. I counted three sets of five hundred, then saw Daddy and lots of bodyguards..."

Recalling the scary scene, Daisy shivered.

Olivia hugged her tighter, glancing at Lucas with questioning eyes.

Lucas gestured outside the room, and Olivia, reassured Daisy was safe, gently pulled away. "Daisy, rest for a bit. I’ll go check on Tommy, okay?"

Daisy quickly sat up. "Is Tommy hurt? I want to see him too!"

Olivia gently pushed her back down. "Daisy, you need to rest. Once you wake up, you can see him. Don’t worry, Mommy will take care of Tommy. But if you don't rest, you won't be as pretty!"

"Okay," Daisy reluctantly agreed, still not wanting to let her mom go. "Go see Tommy quickly!"

Olivia gave some final instructions to Daisy’s caregivers and hurried out of the room.

Lucas followed closely.

As soon as they reached the hallway, Olivia asked, "Where’s Tommy? Which room?"

Lucas bowed slightly, "Olivia, please follow me."

They walked down the corridor, past several rooms. Olivia’s heart sank with each step, anxiety growing with the distance. Finally, she stopped.

"Lucas, where are you taking me? Is Tommy in serious condition? Is he in... intensive care?"

"No, no! Olivia, don’t worry!"

Lucas glanced back to ensure Daisy’s room was out of earshot, then faced Olivia, apologetically.

"I'm sorry, Olivia. I didn’t dare tell you earlier. Tommy... he hasn’t been found yet."

"What?"

Olivia felt darkness closing in, her body swaying as if she might faint.
