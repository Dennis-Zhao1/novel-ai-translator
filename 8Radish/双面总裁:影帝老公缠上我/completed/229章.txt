"I Won't Marry Her"

Isabella Peterson let out a nonchalant "hmm" at the news her mom considered "good." To him, his mother's good news always meant bad news for him.

Mrs. Peterson was all smiles, "Olivia White is back!"

Of course, that was the so-called good news.

Seeing his indifference, Mrs. Peterson thought he was still upset about his dad's lecture, so she patted his shoulder reassuringly. "Your dad's just like that. Just don't argue back later, alright? Oh, and Olivia is here, so spend some time with her. It'll keep your dad from getting mad."

Isabella avoided her mom's eager gaze, maintaining his aloof demeanor. "Mom, I'm heading upstairs first. Don't leave yet; I need to ask you something later."

"Alright!" Mrs. Peterson beamed. "It's been a while since you wanted to chat with your mom. I'll wait for you."

Isabella made his way to his grandfather Nathan Peterson's study.

The moment he walked in, a fine porcelain cup flew past him, shattering at his feet. Isabella stood there unfazed, greeting his father calmly, "Dad."

"You still remember I'm your father? Tell me, what kind of trouble have you gotten into that requires our company's medical team? The White family knows, and Olivia's already made a scene!"

Isabella met Nathan's gaze, his expression unchanging. "Why should we be afraid of the White family causing a scene?"

Nathan glared at Isabella, commanding him with no room for argument, "You need to give the White family an explanation, and you must end things with that woman and marry Olivia."

"I can't do that," Isabella replied bluntly. "What leverage do they have over you to force me into this?"

"How dare you!" Nathan slammed his hand on the table, his face reddening with anger. He did have something being held over him by the Whites, but that wasn't something he could ever reveal.

Nathan swallowed his rage with a large gulp of cold tea, trying to maintain his authoritative composure. "You will marry her, whether you want to or not! If you want that woman to have a good life, you have no choice."

Was that a threat? If he refused to marry Olivia, would his grandfather really harm Olivia Stewart?

Isabella's expression turned serious. "Dad, I'm no longer the sickly kid you could push around. You'd better leave Olivia alone, or there will be no one to inherit the Peterson Group."

"You...!" Nathan's eyes widened in disbelief. "You've turned against me!"

Isabella walked out boldly. He had no fondness for his grandfather. If Nathan had cared even a little when Isabella was sick, he wouldn't have ended up at death's door. But since childhood, he was seen as a lost cause, with his grandfather looking for heirs elsewhere.

Thinking about the past, Isabella felt a heavy weight in his chest. He wouldn't let anyone harm Olivia, not even his family.

As Isabella turned down the ornately decorated corridor, Mrs. Peterson rushed to meet him, asking worriedly, "Isabella, did your father give you a hard time? Did he hit you?"

Isabella pressed his lips together. "No."

Mrs. Peterson, still worried, checked him over. The Peterson family was strict, and she feared her son would bear the brunt of it. Seeing he was unharmed, she sighed in relief. "Good. Come in and have some milk."

Following her inside, Isabella's eyes flickered with a complex emotion. Despite his past health issues, his mother always had milk ready for him, a habit she never gave up.

In this cold, large family, his mother was the only one who truly cared for him. Although she put on airs in front of others, to him, she was just a mother who loved her son.

If not for the evidence, Isabella would never have believed his mother had done such heartless things.

They sat in the tea room, where his mother used to sing lullabies to him as a child. Isabella took the milk she offered, sipping quietly.

Mrs. Peterson gazed at his handsome yet distant face. "Son, you seem troubled. Is your dad pressuring you to marry Olivia? I've told him many times, if you don't like her, it doesn't matter. Just find someone to give you a child. But he won't listen!"

Isabella frowned. More talk about children! His parents were a perfect pair, with his dad pushing for marriage and his mom for grandchildren.

He was in his twenties; what was the rush for a child? But his mom was like a cat on a hot tin roof, eager for grandkids.

The Petersons prided themselves on their legacy, and for the sake of a grandson, his mom would have any woman have a child for him, not caring about past scandals. If she knew Olivia was the one involved in the past, there'd be another uproar. But given her past actions...

Isabella finished his milk, lifting his gaze.

Mrs. Peterson, caught by his chilly look, whispered, "I've tried to convince him, but he never listens to us. He only cares for your uncle's illegitimate son!"

Her face twisted with resentment, a look Isabella had never seen before.

This might be his mother's true self.

Isabella's gaze grew colder, tinged with disappointment.

Seeing her son's look, Mrs. Peterson was anxious. "Why not just marry Olivia? You can have any woman you want on the side. If there's a child, I'll help bring them in. Would that work?"

"What if I want Olivia Stewart?"

"Who? What did you say?"

"Olivia Stewart!"

"You..." Mrs. Peterson clutched her chest, sinking back into her chair.

"Son, after all these years, do you still blame me? I should have given her more money back then. Maybe then she would have..."

"I know what happened back then."

Mrs. Peterson's face turned pale, looking at Isabella in shock. "Son..."

"You had Olivia hypnotized, didn't you?"

Mrs. Peterson took several deep breaths to calm herself. Seeing there was no point in hiding, she nodded. "Yes, but it was for your own good. A woman who'd sell anything for money isn't worthy of you. And her family, ugh..."

She waved her hand dismissively, as if to shoo away bad luck, her expression sharp and disdainful.

Isabella's brow furrowed, his face frosty.

He hated people badmouthing Olivia, even if it was his own mother.

Isabella's hand gripped the cup tightly, his voice cold. "Mom, I appreciate all your care over the years, but please don't use love as an excuse to ruin my happiness."

Mrs. Peterson finally realized her son wasn't here to see her; he was here to confront her.

Her face shifted through emotionsâ€”shock, anger, disappointment, hurt...

"You're questioning your mother for that woman?" Her voice choked with tears.

A trace of reluctance crossed Isabella's face, but he quickly regained his composure, answering calmly, "She's the best woman in the world and deserves to be treated as such. I won't marry Olivia. If you convince Dad, I won't hold the past against you."

"You found her, didn't you? She told you about the hypnosis? She's regained her memory? I should have never let her go!" Mrs. Peterson slumped back, filled with regret.

Isabella's cold gaze swept over her, his words firm. "If you had, I'd find out eventually, and you wouldn't have a son."

"You...! How dare you speak to me like that! You ungrateful child!"

Mrs. Peterson stared at him, tears of sorrow falling.

"I said, if you convince Dad to break off the engagement with Olivia, this will be forgotten."

Mrs. Peterson continued to cry, not responding to her son.

"Also, I returned to confirm something. I hope you'll be honest."

Isabella's tone was so serious that Mrs. Peterson forgot to cry, looking at him blankly. "What is it?"

"Did you have Olivia hypnotized a second time? What happened to the child she was carrying?"

"Child? She was pregnant?" Mrs. Peterson jumped up in shock. "What child? I don't know!"

Isabella's sharp eyes bore into her. "Mom, I hope you're telling the truth."

"I am!" Mrs. Peterson said, indignant at the accusation. "Back then..."
