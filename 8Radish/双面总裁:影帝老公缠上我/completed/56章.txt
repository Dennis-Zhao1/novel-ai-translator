Red Dots Everywhere

Isabella Peterson watched as Olivia Stewart dashed away, her back disappearing into the distance. She couldn't help but let out a sigh mixed with a hint of exasperation. 

"Did I not make myself clear enough?" Isabella thought to herself, shaking her head. She had hoped Olivia would be touched by her gesture, yet the girl had bolted faster than a startled rabbit. Maybe it was time to sit Olivia down and explain everything clearly, even if recalling the past still made her feel a bit uneasy.

The moment Olivia almost fell off the edge of the greenhouse, Isabella had felt a genuine panic. Losing Olivia was not an option. She’d rather cherish her, flaws and all, than see her slip away.

Normally not one to explain herself, Isabella had tried different ways to show Olivia that she was ready to let go of past grievances. But it seemed Olivia hadn't quite gotten the message.

Determined, Isabella marched up the stairs and flung open Olivia’s bedroom door. She found Olivia scratching furiously at her skin, half out of her clothes like a monkey on a sugar high. Startled by Isabella's sudden entrance, Olivia let out a shriek and hastily covered her chest, her face turning red with embarrassment and frustration.

"Get out, Isabella Peterson, you big pervert!" she shouted, trying to maintain some semblance of dignity.

Ignoring her protests, Isabella wrapped her arms around Olivia, gently but firmly holding her in place. She tipped Olivia's chin up, forcing her to meet her gaze, her expression more serious than ever.

"Listen up," Isabella declared with an intensity that left no room for argument. "Whatever happened before, I’m over it. It was just a one-time thing, and I plan to make sure your past with your ex gets erased a hundred times over. You're mine, Olivia. Only mine."

Olivia, still locked in Isabella's embrace, felt her cheeks grow hot. "Can we talk about this later? I really need to scratch!" she gasped.

Isabella released her grip and noticed for the first time the angry red welts covering Olivia's skin. Some spots were swollen, and Olivia looked like she’d scratched them almost raw.

"How did this happen?" Isabella muttered, quickly wrapping Olivia in a blanket and lifting her off her feet to rush downstairs. As she ran, she yelled, "Doctor! Lucas Wright, get the doctor now!"

Olivia, nestled in Isabella’s arms, felt her discomfort ease slightly as she listened to Isabella's hurried footsteps and frantic shouting. She tried to calm Isabella down, "It's alright, don’t make such a fuss."

"Alright? You look like a mess, and you didn’t even think to call a doctor, Olivia? Are you out of your mind?" Isabella snapped. "If you end up with scars and ruin your looks, I swear I'll give you a hard time!"

Olivia couldn't help but smile at Isabella's sharp tongue, finding it oddly endearing for the first time. "Oh, I thought you were just worried about me. Turns out you're just scared I might become an eyesore!"

"Shut up!" Isabella retorted, her face set in a grumpy frown.

Olivia watched Isabella's stern expression, feeling an urge to tease him more. "Don't worry, Isabella. If I really do turn ugly, I'll find a place to hide and never show up in front of you again."

Isabella froze, his face turning icy. "Don't you dare!"

"Olivia, I’m telling you, there’s no place on Earth I wouldn’t search to find you. And when I do, you’ll hear about it three times a day!"

"No, ten times!" he added for emphasis.

Olivia, realizing she may have pushed him too far, wisely kept her mouth shut.

The family doctor arrived quickly with a medical kit and diagnosed the issue as a simple allergic reaction. After giving Olivia some antihistamines and a soothing ointment, the doctor reassured Isabella, "It's just a common allergy, sir. With some medication and avoiding the allergen, she should be fine in a few days."

"What’s the allergen?" Isabella demanded.

"There are many possibilities: pollen, milk, seafood..."

Isabella turned to Olivia. "What are you allergic to?"

"I have no idea!" Olivia shrugged helplessly. "This has never happened before. I’m usually fine with all those things."

Isabella's handsome face remained as impassive as a block of ice. He instructed the doctor, "Stay in the castle until she's fully recovered."

"Yes, sir."

Isabella then looked at Lucas Wright. "Check everything Olivia eats, wears, and uses. You have one day to find the allergen. If you can’t, you’re both out."

"Yes, sir!" Lucas responded promptly.

Olivia tugged on Isabella’s sleeve, pleading, "Don’t be so harsh. The doctor said it’s just a minor issue. A little medication will fix it."

Isabella glared at the ointment in his hand. "Will this leave scars?"

The doctor quickly reassured him, "No, sir. But she must avoid foods with too much coloring for a while, just in case."

"Tell Lucas Wright about the dietary restrictions. Lucas, you’re in charge of Olivia's meals. Oversee every dish personally!"

With that, Isabella picked up Olivia again. "Let's get you treated."

Instinctively, Olivia wrapped her arms around Isabella's neck, but quickly recoiled at the sight of her own red spots. She was horrified by her appearance—and Isabella was such a neat freak...

Almost reading her mind, Isabella pretended to let go, making Olivia yelp and grab onto him tightly. His expression remained cool.

"Serves you right if you fall," he said.

Olivia, now clinging securely, decided there was no point in being self-conscious. If Isabella didn’t mind, why should she?

Back in Olivia's room, they found Alyssa lingering by the door, eyes wide with shock at seeing Olivia cradled in Isabella's arms. Isabella shot her a frosty glance. "What are you standing there for? Open the door!"

"Oh… I’m sorry, sir!" Alyssa mumbled, quickly apologizing and opening the door, jealousy flashing in her eyes.

Isabella gently placed Olivia on the bed but pulled her back up when she touched the sheets. "Alyssa, get fresh sheets!"

Alyssa, her emotions in check, fetched new linens for Olivia, then stood by, worry etched on her face. "Will Olivia be alright?"

Her concern only earned her another sharp look from Isabella. "What kind of personal maid are you?"

"I'm sorry, sir, I..."

"Enough! I don’t want to hear it. Leave!"

"Yes, sir!" Alyssa left, sniffling as she wiped her eyes.

Olivia took Isabella's hand, trying to calm him. "Don’t get mad over nothing. I’m fine, really. Alyssa has a tough job, and it’s even harder since she has feelings for you. Being scolded by you must really hurt her."

"Olivia, you’re too nice! You know she’s got ulterior motives, yet you still wanted her back. And now look what happened."

"It might not even be Alyssa’s fault," Olivia countered. "I could’ve picked up something in the greenhouse."

"Olivia, I’ll make sure you see just how naive you are," Isabella said, ripping open Olivia's nightgown with a swift motion.

Olivia yelped and covered herself. "Isabella, what are you doing?"

"Applying medicine," Isabella replied, casting a disdainful glance at her irritated skin. "You think I’d… ugh, it’s hideous!"

Olivia pouted. "Maybe I should do it myself."

"Your head can't turn backwards. Can you reach every spot?"

Olivia had no answer to that. Okay, she admitted, she needed help with the hard-to-reach places. But having Isabella do it felt...

"Maybe Alyssa could help me?" she suggested.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed. "I told you, I’m not interested in you right now. Why so stubborn? Alyssa’s a problem. How many times do I have to say it? She handles your food, clothes, everything. You were fine before. Now this? I bet you crossed her somehow."

Olivia frowned, deep in thought. "Really? I thought I was nice to her."

"Such a little lamb! Innocent at best, foolish at worst," Isabella muttered, dabbing ointment on Olivia’s rash while examining the red spots closely.

The rash was worst on her neck, back, and chest, less so on her abdomen and legs.

"I think it’s your nightgown. We’ll check all your clothes after this," Isabella decided.

"My clothes are scented by Alyssa every day. Could it really be her doing? I didn’t feel anything unusual before. It just got worse today after changing clothes."

Olivia’s eyes suddenly lit up with realization.

"Did you remember something odd?"

"When I came back to change, Alyssa was busy in my closet. I was too itchy to care at the time. But after I changed, it got much worse. Now that I think about it, Alyssa must be involved. Did I upset her somehow? Is it because of you?"

The thought that Alyssa might have acted out of jealousy made Olivia shoot Isabella a glare.

"Why do you have to be so handsome? Just asking for trouble!"

Olivia was too busy venting to notice she’d just staked her claim on Isabella. Isabella’s lips curled into a sly smile.

Finally, the little thing was starting to act like she belonged to him.
