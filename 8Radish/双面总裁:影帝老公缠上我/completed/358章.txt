Bone-Chilling Pain

Even though Tony had no idea how vast the forest was, how deep the undergrowth went, or whether Gogo would run into danger on her own, he couldn't worry about that right now. All he wanted was for her to get out of the car immediately. The creepy guy with the snake obsession was unpredictable, and Tony couldn't imagine what he might do to sweet Gogo.

The car hit a steep incline and slowed down noticeably. Tony gritted his teeth, ready to take a gamble.

Just as he reached out to push Gogo out of the car, she stirred slightly and let out a soft "hmm." Startled, Tony instinctively clamped his hand over her mouth.

Feeling the trembling of her small frame, Tony eased his grip slightly and whispered in her ear, "Gogo, it's me, Tony! Don't be scared. If you stay quiet, I'll let you go."

Gogo nodded obediently. Tony released her gently and whispered again, "We've run into some bad guys. We're on a car right now. I'm going to push you into the bushes. Are you up for it?"

After a moment of hesitation, Gogo nodded, then turned to Tony, her big eyes shining brightly. She whispered, "What about you?"

"I'll jump down after a bit," Tony replied.

The car was almost at the top of the hill, and Tony knew they were running out of time. "There's no time!" he said urgently. "I'm going to push you down now. Stay hidden in the bushes and count to five hundred before you call for help."

Gogo nodded again, her voice soft but determined. "Be careful when you jump, Tony. I'll wait for you to come find me."

Tony's heart ached, but he didn't respond. Seizing the moment when Gogo wasn't looking, he yanked up a corner of the black tarp, spotted a dense bush by the roadside, and pushed her out with all his might.

With a thud, Gogo tumbled into the underbrush. Simultaneously, a branch scraped against the side of the car, creating a rustling noise that masked the sound of Gogo hitting the ground and the tarp flapping.

Tony had chosen the timing meticulously. Only at that moment could he best cover up the noise. However, the branch had also left several stinging scratches on his face.

Watching Gogo disappear into the bushes, Tony finally took a breath of relief. The tarp, nudged by the branches, settled back into place, and everything returned to quiet.

In the darkness, Tony sat down, tears spilling from his eyes, stinging as they mingled with the scratches on his face. He bit his lip hard, repeating to himself over and over: As long as Gogo is safe, it's all worth it. She'll escape and bring help.

Gogo had once told him to run when they were surrounded by the black-clad men. Now, he was giving her the chance to live. They were even.

Once the slope was behind them, the car picked up speed again. Tony sat silently in the back, covering his face, now streaked with blood and tears.

He had lied to Gogo. He never intended to jump. He tricked her to keep her calm, knowing he couldn't risk a second jump without being caught by the snake guy. If he was discovered, it would be too easy for Gogo to be recaptured.

If he were to jump, it would have to be much later. Unfortunately, beyond the forest lay a wide open road, and Tony would no longer have the chance.

Quiet sobs filled the air, tears streaming steadily through Tony's fingers. He knew too well what awaited himâ€”he'd lived through a nightmare before. The scars on his arms from the snake guy's knife seemed to throb with remembered pain. This time, the guy might just kill him.

If I die, will Aunt Olivia be sad? he wondered. Maybe, since I'm like a son to her, right? I've always wanted to call her Mom, but I guess I'll never get the chance.

The more Tony thought, the more heartbroken he became, and he cried harder. Suddenly, the car hit a bump and stopped.

Lost in his sorrow, Tony didn't notice until a strong hand grabbed the back of his shirt, lifting him like a toy.

"What are you doing here?" Alexander Peterson's face turned a shade of green upon seeing Tony.

To avoid attention, he'd bought an old, battered convertible, which had now broken down halfway. Already frustrated, Alexander had heard faint cries from the back, thinking the girl might have woken up by now. Remembering her cute face, similar to Olivia's as a child, he'd planned to comfort her.

Instead, it was Tony in the back. His gentle intentions turned into fury in an instant.

"Where is she?" Alexander's voice, cold as ice, whispered in Tony's ear like a dire warning from the abyss.

In that moment, Tony stopped crying. Through tear-blurred eyes, he looked at Alexander's furious gaze and managed a small smile.

"Idiot!" Alexander cursed, throwing Tony to the ground with all his strength. Tony's body flew several feet before landing with a sickening crack.

Tony lay trembling, his pale face now ghostly white, cold sweat dripping from his brow. The pain was excruciating, but he didn't make a sound, biting down on his lip until it turned a ghostly shade of white.

Alexander stalked over, glaring down at him. "I'll ask you one last time, where is Gogo?"

Tony remained silent, his eyes calm but filled with defiance. Blood trickled from his lip, a vivid red against the white of his skin.

Even with his lip bitten through, he wouldn't cry out. Even if it meant dying, he wouldn't reveal Gogo's whereabouts.

Tony's stubborn silence infuriated Alexander. In a fit of rage, he hurled Tony to the ground again.

"Crack!"

Tony couldn't suppress a groan this time, his face contorting in agony. Alexander's brutality left him feeling like his bones had shattered, organs screaming in pain.

A sharp rock had sliced his leg, leaving a deep gash from ankle to knee. Blood flowed freely, soaking the ground.

Alexander crouched down, a small golden knife twirling between his fingers. Originally, he intended to scare Tony, but now the knife seemed unnecessary.

Calmly, he glanced at Tony's leg, raising an eyebrow with a cold smile. "Forgot to mention, I was a pretty good surgeon once. That cut on your leg? It hit an artery. Without help, you'll bleed out in under thirty minutes."

Alexander's voice turned soft, almost affectionate, as he stroked Tony's head. "Tell me where your sister is, and I'll save you."

Tony said nothing.

"Don't worry, I won't hurt her."

Tony remained silent.

"You probably don't know, but I like her mother. She's just as cute as her mom was. Why would I harm her? I'll take her somewhere safe, raise her with care, and she'll never meet another man. That way, she'll only love me."

Alexander's eyes glazed over, lost in his twisted fantasy. Yet Tony stayed silent, biting his lip.

Suddenly, Alexander turned back to Tony, his dreamy look replaced by cold fury. "You ruined everything! You shattered my dreams! You're dead!"

In his rage, Alexander slashed at Tony with the knife. Tony turned his head, the blade grazing his neck, releasing another gush of blood.

"Hahaha... A severed carotid! Kid, do you know? With that cut, you'll be dead in ten minutes!"

"Want me to save you?"

"Just tell me where Gogo is."

Tony's silence persisted, like a stone by the roadside, unmoving.

"Since you're so eager to die, I won't stop you!" Alexander snorted, his gaze as cold as that of a dead man.

Without another glance, Alexander turned and walked away, searching the roadside bushes as he retraced his steps.

Tony lay motionless, blood pooling around him. The pain dulled into numbness, consciousness slipping away. He could feel life draining with every drop of blood, the world growing colder.

As darkness encroached, Tony held onto one thought: Gogo was safe. And that was all that mattered.
