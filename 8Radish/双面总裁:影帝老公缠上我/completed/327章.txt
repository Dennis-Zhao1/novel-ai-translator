Isabella Peterson was taken aback by a subtle smile that seemed to light up Olivia Stewart's face. With excitement bubbling over, she grabbed Olivia's hand and exclaimed, "You love playing with clay, right? This is our twin son, Coco, and this little princess here is our daughter, Gogo. Remember when you sculpted a pair of twins, and then we actually had them? Do you remember any of that?"

Olivia didn't respond, but there was a hint of liveliness in her eyes as she continued molding the clay in her hands.

Isabella, thrilled beyond words, lifted Olivia and spun her around the spacious clay studio until Olivia was dizzy and giggling. When she finally put her back down, she beamed at her and eagerly asked, "How about we sculpt another pair?"

Olivia didn't say anything but placed her clay sculpture on the table and picked up another lump of clay, clearly understanding Isabella's intent.

Trying to contain her joy, Isabella rolled up her sleeves and joined Olivia in their clay sculpting session. They worked in harmony, with Isabella crafting the basic forms and Olivia refining the details, adding charming little features to each figure.

Though Olivia seemed unsure of herself, her hands worked instinctively, capturing the essence of their children in clay. Isabella was smitten with the adorable little figurines, lovingly picking up one of the creations and teasingly asking Olivia, "Are you planning on giving us another 'little bun' to cherish?"

Olivia didn't blush or shy away. Instead, she playfully waved a hand, as if swatting a fly, leaving Isabella both amused and exasperated.

At least Olivia wasn't rejecting her advances, Isabella thought, considering it a significant step forward. She leaned in for another kiss, but Olivia was already absorbed in her own world, shaping clay into yet another miniature princess, leaving Isabella chuckling at her own failed attempt.

Olivia spent the entire afternoon in the clay studio, molding a myriad of little figures, from cute versions of Coco and Gogo to caricatures of themselves. Isabella made sure all the figures were set aside for drying and painting later.

"Come on, Olivia," she said gently, washing Olivia's hands. "You've been at it all day. Let's go home and rest."

Olivia's hands lay quietly in Isabella's as she washed them with care. Her face, serene and peaceful, showed no trace of the sadness that had haunted her.

Back at the castle, the staff greeted them with curious looks. Isabella, in a commanding tone, instructed, "Olivia needs rest. Keep things quiet around here, and don't come in unless necessary."

The staff nodded and dispersed, while the nannies stood by with the twins, poised to ascend the stairs. Isabella called them over. "Bring the kids here."

As Coco and Gogo reached for Olivia, babbling "Mama, Mama," Olivia stood there, neither reaching out to embrace them nor showing any sign of displeasure.

Coco's little face turned sullen, while Gogo burst into tears. As the nanny moved to comfort her, Isabella gave a subtle gesture to let it be. Gogo, stubborn as ever, clung to Olivia's clothes, crying louder, determined to be held.

Hearing Gogo's cries echoing through the hall, Olivia suddenly broke away, running upstairs.

Isabella had hoped the children might jog Olivia's memory, but instead, she seemed to retreat further. Was she worried about the past?

He signaled the nanny to take the twins upstairs and soothe them, then turned to leave, contemplating Olivia's reaction.

He paused, realizing he needed to check on Olivia before considering anything else. Her distress over their son, Tom, who she thought might have been hurt, was a deep wound.

Returning upstairs, Isabella found the room empty, save for a cozy mound on the bed. He approached quietly, lifting the edge of the blanket to find Olivia wide awake beneath.

"Olivia," he murmured, his brow furrowed with concern.

As expected, Olivia didn't respond, curling into herself as if trying to disappear.

"Alright," Isabella sighed softly. "If you need to rest, go ahead. I'll call you for dinner. Just don't cover your head while you sleep, okay?"

Receiving no response, he gently uncovered her face, brushing her hair fondly before stepping out.

As he closed the door, he glanced back, seeing Olivia pull the blanket over her head again.

This girl... Isabella thought, shaking his head as he retreated to his study to call the psychologist, hoping for insights into Olivia's behavior.

The psychologist, after hearing Isabella's account, suggested, "It sounds like Olivia is dealing with a deep-seated issue related to the children. This could be the root of her depression, exacerbated by other stressors."

"I'll have a more detailed analysis for you tomorrow," the psychologist promised.

Isabella, contemplating the psychologist's words, thought about Tom. Olivia's unresolved feelings about him, combined with his complex background, weighed heavily on her.

He headed back down, determined to address the situation with Tom, who had been isolated after causing trouble.

Entering the room where Tom was kept, Isabella was greeted by a sudden attack as Tom lunged, attempting to bite him. Reacting swiftly, Isabella caught him mid-air, tossing him back onto the bed.

Tom glared defiantly, fists clenched, ready for a fight.

"Listen, kid," Isabella scolded, "the only reason you're not in deeper trouble is because of Olivia. She cares about you."

Tom's eyes flickered at the mention of Olivia, but the resentment remained.

"Get it together," Isabella continued. "You've already upset Olivia. Don't push your luck."

Tom's silence spoke volumes, and Isabella, frustrated, remarked, "You're just as stubborn as she is."

Tom stuck out his tongue defiantly before dashing toward the door, leaving Isabella to wonder how to untangle this web of emotions and find a way to heal his family.
