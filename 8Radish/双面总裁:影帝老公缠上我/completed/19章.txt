Olivia Stewart glared at Isabella Peterson, her eyes practically on fire. "You ruined my chance at earning a living!"

"I'll take care of you."

"Isabella, can you not be so arrogant? Sure, women love hearing a guy say that, but usually after he says 'I love you,' not 'I want you!'"

"How about I say both?"

Olivia could almost see cartoon birds flying over her head. "Whatever, just give me my phone back!"

"Feeling adorable..."

How was it that every time Isabella got her phone, calls just wouldn't stop coming? Olivia gave up trying to snatch it back—she knew it was a lost cause.

Isabella seemed to enjoy letting the phone ring endlessly without offering to answer it. Meanwhile, Olivia's patience was wearing thin. Finally, she reached out, but Isabella beat her to it, pressing the answer button. A sugary sweet voice chimed through, "Sis, where's the five thousand dollars you promised?"

"I’m broke right now!" Olivia shouted.

"She’ll get it to you in a couple of days!" Isabella replied, apparently louder or more convincingly. The caller, satisfied, hung up with a cheerful "Thanks!"

Olivia's expression darkened as she stared daggers at Isabella, hands on her hips, ready to throw down. "Isabella, are you trying to ruin my life?"

"Maybe," Isabella replied, lips curling into a mischievous smile.

A mere day ago, he nearly succeeded, just barely missing the mark. Olivia felt like a balloon about to burst with frustration. "Isabella, can you stop answering my calls? Fine, I don't even want that stupid phone anymore, okay?"

"Whoosh—"

Before she finished speaking, Isabella casually tossed her phone out the window.

"What the heck is wrong with you?" Olivia raced to the window, just in time to see the phone smashed into pieces on the ground below.

"Why’d you throw it?"

"You said you didn't want it."

"And if I say I want to leave, why don’t you let me go? Now you owe me a new one!"

"Alright." Isabella approached and wrapped an arm around her waist.

Olivia dodged. "What are you doing?"

"I thought you wanted me to accompany you."

"I meant compensate me! Compensate, not accompany! Did you learn English from a gym teacher? I want a replacement, at least an iPhone 7!"

Isabella chuckled, "Is that all you aspire to?"

Then, like a magician, he pulled a brand-new phone from his desk, placing it in her hand.

So he had this planned all along. A gift with such a roundabout delivery—what a complicated guy! Olivia glanced at the phone, its rose gold finish clearly meant for a girl. Sleek, lightweight, and elegant, it felt luxurious in her hand.

"What brand is this?"

"Isabella Peterson’s brand, limited edition!"

He said it with such flair, like he expected her to swoon and kiss him as thanks. Olivia flipped the phone over, noticing the back was inlaid with tiny crystals spelling out "Isabella."

A bespoke gift, no less. Suddenly, the phone felt heavy in her hand, and her heart sank with it.

"Isn't it way more sophisticated than your old junk?" Isabella beamed with pride. "I personally designed all the apps. Try it out, and if you're not satisfied, I'll customize it for you."

"Uh, no need. You go ahead and work. I'll explore it myself." Olivia said, playing nice while clutching the phone.

Despite "Isabella's" affection, she needed this phone to contact Ethan King and find a way out!

Isabella ruffled her hair affectionately, "You play with it for a bit. I'll join you once I finish this software."

Olivia smiled sweetly, phone in hand, and quickly made her escape, afraid he'd change his mind and drag her back.

As she slipped out of the study, Olivia couldn't believe her luck.

Was it really this easy?

Her triumph was short-lived. Once around the corner, she eagerly powered up the phone. The interface was beautifully minimalist, with all the usual apps and a smart voice assistant. "Hello, beautiful owner! Would you like to relax or make a call?"

"Make a call!"

"Sure thing, one moment!"

The phone book popped up, displaying a single contact: "Hubby," complete with a dashing profile pic of Isabella.

Olivia blushed. What a ridiculous prankster!

She decided to manually dial. Struggling to remember Ethan King's number, she finally pieced it together and dialed.

"Hey, babe, missing me already?" a familiar, smooth voice answered.

"Uh… sorry, sir, wrong number!" Olivia quickly hung up, trying another number.

"Boss, I can’t make it today…"

"Babe, call me hubby!" came the same voice.

"Isabella!" Olivia shrieked, dropping the phone like it was hot.

Why was every call answered by Isabella’s voice? What kind of trickery was this?

Determined, Olivia tried calling again. She dialed public numbers—911, 311—and even emergency services, but still got the same result!

Finally, she dialed the "Hubby" contact.

"Isabella, what gives? This phone can’t make a single call out!"

"I programmed it so that any issue hubby can solve doesn't need to connect elsewhere."

What a controlling, arrogant jerk!

A phone with only one contact, like an emergency hotline—how useless!

Olivia cut the call, unwilling to exchange another word with Isabella. Just hearing his voice made her want to scream.

Storming down the staircase, she ignored the staff greeting her with "Miss Olivia!" It grated on her nerves.

"Miss Olivia, heading to change clothes?" a voice asked.

Olivia looked up to see Alyssa. She realized she was still in her silk pajamas from yesterday, having run around all morning and making a fool of herself.

Last night, her silk nightgown got torn, and she found only more pajamas in her closet. Isabella must have planned that too!

"Yeah, I need to change!" she replied.

"Right this way, Miss Olivia."

Following Alyssa to the dressing room, Olivia eyed her slyly. "Alyssa, my phone's dead. Mind if I borrow yours to make a quick call?"
