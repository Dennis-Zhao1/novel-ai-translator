Olivia Stewart woke up with a feeling like she’d stumbled into a dream. Above her was a high, sweeping dome with delicate lavender lace trailing down in intricate layers. The bed she lay on was a massive European-style princess bed, complete with soft, silky pink sheets that felt like a dream against her skin. As someone who loved to sleep like a log, she thought this was heaven.

Olivia couldn't resist rolling around on the luxurious bed a couple of times before jumping up to take in her surroundings. The room was huge and filled with soft pink and lavender hues, with charming decorations and a whimsical collection of stuffed animals and figurines. A string of amethyst wind chimes hung by the window, their gentle tinkling adding to the fairy-tale atmosphere.

“This is straight out of a storybook,” she thought, tiptoeing across the plush lavender carpet as if she were wandering through a magical kingdom. Whoever lived in a place like this must be incredibly lucky.

After a brief exploration, she made her way to the large window, pulled back the delicate curtains, and was greeted by a breathtaking view: lakes, lush greenery, and an array of castles, each more fantastical than the last. It was like a world of castles right out of a storybook.

Olivia pulled her head back in. "Where am I?" she wondered. She felt like Cinderella who had just woken up in a palace.

Just then, she heard a knock. A woman in a lilac maid’s dress entered and curtsied. "Good morning, Olivia Stewart. Would you like some breakfast now?"

“Who are you? And how did I get here?” Olivia asked, rubbing her head. The night before was a blur, thanks to a bit too much to drink.

The maid, named Alissa, smiled coyly. "You were brought here last night by the young master himself."

Olivia's eyes widened. She glanced down at herself—she was wearing a silky, pale pink nightgown that looked incredibly expensive. "My clothes… where are they?"

“They’re being cleaned and pressed. But don't worry, the young master prepared plenty of new clothes for you. Let me show you to your wardrobe.”

“Wait!” Olivia exclaimed, her cheeks turning a shade of red. “Who changed my clothes?”

“I did,” Alissa replied, “I’m your personal maid.”

Just then, a cool voice interrupted, “I wouldn’t take advantage of a drunk woman.”

Olivia and Alissa turned to see Isabella Peterson, standing tall and casually handsome in a light gray lounge wear, his hair tousled and adding to his allure. Despite his relaxed appearance, his expression was anything but.

“Isabella Peterson,” Olivia breathed, remembering snippets of the previous night. She had asked him to take her home… so why was she here?

He walked over lazily, stopping right in front of her. The air around them seemed to thin, and Olivia felt a sudden urge to bolt. Her back hit the door as she fumbled for words. “Did you bring me here last night?”

Isabella raised an eyebrow, as if to say, “What do you think?”

“I told you to take me home!” she insisted, feeling oddly guilty.

“This is your home,” he replied coolly.

“What the—” she started to curse but stopped herself just in time.

Isabella suddenly leaned down and captured her lips in a swift, unexpected kiss. Olivia’s eyes widened in shock, her brain short-circuiting.

He pulled back slightly, covering her eyes with a gentle hand and whispered, “Close them, silly.”

The kiss was long and passionate, leaving Olivia breathless. As she gasped for air, she demanded, “What was that for?”

“Because,” he said, leaning in with a teasing smile, “you cursed.”

“That’s ridiculous!” Olivia protested, trying to push him away. “You can’t just kiss me whenever you want.”

“In my world, I can.”

“Isabella Peterson, you…” Olivia caught herself again, covering her mouth.

He chuckled softly. “Say it, and I’ll kiss you again.”

Olivia glared at him, her cheeks flushed. “I’m not your Cinderella, Isabella Peterson. I’m Olivia Stewart.”

“I know,” he said, brushing a finger across her cheek. “But you’re still my Olivia.”

Frustrated, Olivia wanted to argue further, but her stomach loudly interrupted with a growl.

“Hungry?” Isabella asked, his mood shifting to amusement. “Let’s get you some breakfast.”

“I’m not your princess!” Olivia insisted, trying to break free.

Isabella’s gaze was intense. “To me, you are.”

Olivia sighed, resigned to her fate for now. She’d figure out how to escape this fairy-tale prison later. For now, breakfast sounded like a good idea.
