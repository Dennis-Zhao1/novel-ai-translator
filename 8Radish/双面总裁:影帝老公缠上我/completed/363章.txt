如果她要总裁夫人的位置呢

Half an hour later, the doctor announced that Tessa had regained her heartbeat and was breathing on her own, temporarily out of immediate danger. The moment Olivia Stewart heard the news, it was like a massive weight was lifted off her chest, and her tightly wound nerves relaxed so suddenly she almost collapsed.

Isabella Peterson reached out and wrapped her arms around Olivia, holding her in a warm, comforting embrace, coaxing her like a child. "It's all over now. Everything's going to be fine! You have to believe that Tessa will pull through and stand healthy and strong before you!"

Olivia nodded gently. "I want to see the woman who saved Tessa!"

"Alright!" Isabella said, scooping Olivia up in her arms and striding towards the observation room.

"Isabella! What are you doing? Put me down!"

Olivia lightly punched Isabella's chest, anxiously reminding her in a whisper. With people coming and going in the hospital, it was embarrassing to be carried around like this!

Isabella raised an eyebrow, speaking with a tone of obviousness. "It's nothing for a husband to carry his wife, right? I'm just saving you some energy, isn't that good?"

Husband, wife... such intimate terms! Olivia's cheeks flushed slightly. Even though their wedding was less than five days away, calling Isabella 'husband' still felt a bit... awkward!

With Tessa in this condition, would the wedding even go on as planned? Why did something always happen whenever she and Isabella started planning their marriage? Was it bad luck, or...

"No overthinking allowed!" Isabella lightly tapped Olivia on the forehead, a gentle tone masking a hint of reproach. "If you even dare to think about not marrying me, I'll deal with you right here and now!"

A clear and present danger! Olivia pouted, feeling a bit wronged. "I wasn't thinking that!"

Although the thought had briefly flitted through her mind, she quickly squashed it.

Isabella set Olivia down, reaching out to ruffle her hair. "Now, you're the wife of a multi-billion-dollar CEO. Show some spirit!"

Olivia poked her dimples with her fingers, forcing a smile as she knocked on the door.

A nurse opened the door, her eyes lighting up with starry admiration at the sight of Isabella, quickly blushing and lowering her head.

"Isabella! Olivia!" Olivia pretended not to notice the nurse's infatuation, subtly stepping in front of her. "How is the lady inside doing?"

The nurse, not daring to look up, replied softly, "She just woke up, still a bit weak."

Olivia's voice was cool. "Alright, you can leave now."

Isabella stood silently behind Olivia, watching her assertive move to stake her claim, a silent smile tugging at his lips. This little thing was jealous! Yet, it was undeniably cute!

Once the nurse left, Olivia entered the room. The woman lying on the bed blinked at the sight of Olivia and Isabella, attempting to sit up.

Olivia hurried over, gently pressing her down. "You're still very weak; just lie down and rest."

The woman blinked, looking at Olivia, a hint of anxiety in her eyes.

Olivia smiled at her reassuringly. "Tessa is doing well, out of immediate danger!"

The woman let out a noticeable sigh of relief.

Olivia took the woman's cold hand in hers, full of gratitude. "Thanks to you, Tessa held on until the life-saving blood arrived. You're a lifesaver for our entire family! Thank you!"

The woman shook her head slightly, offering Olivia a small, beautiful smile.

"Alright, you rest now. When you're better, if you need anything, just ask. We'll do our best to fulfill your requests."

A complex emotion flickered in the woman's eyes. Her lips moved, but she said nothing, merely nodding slightly and closing her eyes, casting a shadow over her pale face.

Due to excessive blood loss, the woman's body was in a semi-comatose, self-protective state. It would take time for her to fully recover. However, with special medication, she should be back to normal in a day or two, and after some rest, she would be fine.

Isabella stood at the woman's bedside, scrutinizing her pale face for a while, frowning slightly.

Olivia glanced at Isabella, about to ask, but was silenced by a look from Isabella. They both quietly left the room.

Hmph, worried about waking her up? When did you become so considerate?

Olivia thought sourly to herself.

Even though this woman was their child's savior, she was also a young and beautiful woman. And the fact that Isabella, who usually paid little attention to women, was staring at her, well, that just made Olivia a bit jealous.

As they exited the observation room, Olivia instructed the nurse outside to take good care of the woman, then followed Isabella back to the lounge.

The lounge was quiet.

After hearing the news about Tessa, Isabella had the housekeeper take the twins back home. There was no point in keeping them at the hospital, especially since a familiar environment might help reduce the psychological impact of the incident.

Isabella sat on the couch, pulling Olivia down to sit on his lap.

"What are you thinking about, hmm?" His voice was low and seductive, his warm breath tickling the back of Olivia's ear.

Even though she knew now wasn't the time for fooling around, Olivia couldn't help but blush.

She shrunk her neck, her eyes downcast, speaking softly, "That woman is quite pretty!"

It was a random comment, but Isabella understood immediately, even agreeing with her. "Yes, she is quite pretty."

Olivia's heart filled with jealousy, and she twisted slightly in annoyance.

"Don't move!"

Isabella's voice suddenly turned husky as he held her still.

Sensing Isabella's change, Olivia cursed under her breath, her face burning as she froze, not daring to move.

Isabella awkwardly changed the subject. "Olivia, did you notice anything different about that woman?"

"Really? You seem to have paid quite a bit of attention! What's different?"

Olivia's voice carried a hint of jealousy.

"Are you jealous?"

Isabella's deep, amused voice came, followed by a restrained laugh.

"You..."

Olivia was so angry she wanted to smack that annoyingly handsome face.

Flirting with other women, huh?

Isabella stopped laughing, capturing Olivia's soft hand and kissing it lightly. "Did you notice she looks a little like you?"

Olivia's eyebrows shot up, and she instinctively touched her face.

"Like me? I didn't notice. I just thought she was pretty!"

Isabella was amused by Olivia's innocent comment, playfully tapping her nose. "Are you indirectly complimenting yourself?"

"Pfft!"

Olivia chuckled, the tension and anxiety from Tessa's accident dissipating a bit.

"Little jealous one!"

Isabella wrapped his arms around her, resting his chin on her shoulder, gently nuzzling her.

"I was just thinking, since I've promised her anything she wants, what if she asks for the CEO's wife's position?"

Olivia jumped up, only to be pulled back into Isabella's lap.

"Would you agree? Hmm?"

Olivia's mind was a mess, blurting out, "I don't want to agree, but..."

"As long as you don't want to, that's enough for me!"

Isabella gently bit Olivia's neck.

"I promised her anything within material means. If she dares to covet something out of reach, don't blame me for being ruthless!"

There was a sharp edge to Isabella's voice at the end.

He sensed that this woman's sudden appearance wasn't simple!

If he didn't warn Olivia, this kind-hearted woman might be pressured by gratitude into agreeing to anything, which would be...

Olivia giggled, casting a sidelong glance at Isabella.

"Isabella, you're overthinking it! I might believe that little nurse has a crush on you, but as for that woman, I think she has a special bond with Tessa..."

Olivia frowned, searching for the right words.

The feeling was like... a mother's?

After thinking it over, Olivia decided to share her strange intuition with Isabella.

Isabella's handsome brow furrowed as well.

He had witnessed the woman's reckless effort to save Tessa, so he worried she might risk everything for something difficult to obtain. Yet, he overlooked the possibility of her connection to the child itself.

Considering that none of them matched Tessa's blood type, but the woman did without issue, Isabella's mind raced, piecing together a blurry picture.

Isabella said nothing more, instead holding Olivia and laying her on the bed.

"Get some sleep. If anything happens with Tessa, I'll wake you immediately."

Olivia blinked, a touch of pleading in her eyes. "I don't want to sleep!"

Isabella pulled the blanket up. "Or would you prefer I join you?"

Olivia shut her eyes in a hurry. "No, no, no! I'm falling asleep right now!"

Isabella's lips curved, a hint of affection in his eyes. He gently patted Olivia through the blanket.

Exhausted, Olivia quickly slipped into dreamland once her tension eased.

Isabella's eyes held a complex emotion as he tucked the blanket around Olivia, then turned to leave, heading towards the lab.

The paternity test he had requested should be ready by now, right?
