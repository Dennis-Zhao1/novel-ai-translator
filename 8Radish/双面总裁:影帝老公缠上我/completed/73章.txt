Sophie Cook had her sights set on the most eligible bachelor in town, and today was her big audition. With her pink dress and high ponytail, she was the picture of innocence, even if she was a bundle of nerves. Isabella Peterson watched her on the monitor, completely transfixed. She couldn't help but notice how Sophie reminded her of someone from her past, right down to the way she nervously twisted the edge of her dress, a dead ringer for a gesture Isabella’s old friend used to make.

Director Wang, a seasoned pro, saw the look on Isabella's face and knew immediately that Sophie had caught the eye of someone important. He chuckled knowingly. In this industry, it was not uncommon for producers or investors to take a special interest in young actresses.

Wang appraised Sophie closely. Sure, she was pretty, but not exactly a knockout. However, her sweet voice and innocent demeanor fit the lead role perfectly. He turned to Isabella, asking, "She has potential, don’t you think? Should we have the big boss assess her in the next round?"

Isabella shot back a cold stare, "Do your job. Choose based on merit."

"Of course, of course," Wang quickly agreed, understanding her point. He told his assistant to pass Sophie to the next round of auditions.

Downstairs, Sophie was thrilled to learn she made it through the first cut. She danced around the room like a pink butterfly, her excitement infectious. Her sister, Olivia Stewart, peeked in from the door, grinning ear to ear. Sophie's dream of becoming a star, ever since she was a child, was now one step closer.

Olivia sighed quietly, feeling a mix of pride and heartache—their family had faced many challenges, and now at least one of their dreams was still alive.

As Sophie exited the audition room, she spotted Olivia and rushed over, hugging her tight. "Sis, I made it through! I made it!"

Olivia, who had been carrying the weight of both their dreams and struggles, felt her heart swell with joy. She hugged Sophie back, "I'm so proud of you! You've always been the best, keep it up!"

Then, Sophie pulled away, a bit embarrassed. "Sorry, I forgot we're in public."

Olivia gave a small, understanding smile. "Don't worry, no one saw."

Sophie relaxed, though still a bit awkward. "I didn't mean anything by it, it's just... if anyone saw and started talking, I..."

"Say no more, I get it," Olivia reassured her, squeezing her hand.

"Congrats again. Now go home and rest up for tomorrow's callback. I'll be cheering you on!"

As Olivia turned to go, Sophie called out, "Wait!"

"What is it?"

"Could I... borrow some more money?"

Olivia frowned slightly. "More money?"

"Please, sis," Sophie pleaded, her eyes threatening to tear up. "I hate asking, but I have no other way. If mom were here..."

"Okay, okay, enough with the tears," Olivia relented, softening immediately. "You're such a big girl now, stop crying. I'll give you what I can."

Sophie stopped crying instantly. "You mean it?"

Olivia sighed, "When have I ever let you down? But you've been asking for a lot lately, and I can't keep up."

Sophie held out her hand, "Whatever you can spare."

Olivia emptied her pockets, handing over her earnings from selling cold drinks all day.

"That's it?"

"That's all I have! I spent the day waiting for you, remember?"

Sophie, feeling guilty, tucked the money away. "Thanks, sis, you’re the best."

Olivia tapped her on the shoulder. "Go prepare for tomorrow. I'll see you then."

Sophie nodded obediently, watching Olivia leave.

As soon as Olivia was out of sight, Sophie pulled out her phone, calling her friends. "Hey, guess what? I nailed the audition! Time to celebrate! Meet at our usual spot, drinks on me!"

As she chatted, Sophie spotted a luxury car parked nearby. A Rolls-Royce! She couldn't help but admire it, wishing she could sit in one someday.

Just then, the car door opened, and out stepped a dashing man. Tall, with a perfect face partly hidden by sunglasses, he was the epitome of a rich, handsome guy.

Sophie was entranced, her phone slipping from her hand. Was he coming over to talk to her? Her heart raced.

Suddenly, a familiar figure threw herself into the man's arms. Sophie blinked, realizing it was Olivia.

Her joy turned to anger. Olivia? With him? Was she hiding this from her? While Sophie struggled financially, Olivia had a wealthy boyfriend!

Sophie watched as her sister got into the Rolls-Royce and drove away. Furious, she threw the money Olivia had given her to the ground, only to quickly pick it up again. Money was money, after all.

"I'll show you," Sophie muttered, stuffing the bills back into her pocket. "One day, I'll surpass you."

That night, Sophie drowned her sorrows in a club, drinking until she couldn't stand.

Olivia knew nothing of Sophie's nightlife or her hidden resentment. Their relationship was strained, with Sophie only reaching out when she needed cash.

The next morning, Olivia showed up early for Sophie's callback, but Sophie was nowhere to be seen. Just as the auditions were about to start, Sophie staggered in, her face puffy and eyes red.

"What happened to you?" Olivia asked, worried.

"Mind your own business," Sophie snapped, brushing past her.

Would Sophie make it through the next round?
