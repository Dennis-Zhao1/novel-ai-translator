Chapter 1: The Enigmatic Billionaire

"Whoa—"

Olivia Stewart blushed furiously and pushed Isabella Peterson away. "Isabella, are you part canine or something? Aren't we supposed to be eating? What do you want to eat, the food or me?"

Isabella's eyes gleamed as she locked her gaze on Olivia, and with a teasing smile, she whispered, "You."

Olivia smacked her forehead. "Oh, come on!"

How did she end up digging her own grave here?

Luckily, Isabella didn't press further. She just wrapped Olivia firmly in her arms, playing with her slender fingers, and rested her chin on Olivia's shoulder. "Tired?"

"Yeah, a little."

"Listen, Olivia, I don't care how much you hustle, but there are two rules: First, never sell yourself short. Second, don't carry the weight alone."

Hearing this, Olivia's nose tingled with emotion, and she nodded obediently. "Okay."

"And I've left a no-limit card in the nightstand for you. The PIN is 520531."

"520531..." Olivia repeated, sensing something odd. "That sounds funny."

Isabella's lips curled into a mischievous grin. "Try saying it with the local slang!"

"The local slang?" Olivia gave it a shot and quickly caught on. The numbers, when spoken in the local dialect, sounded just like "I love you, Isabella!" This guy was truly incorrigible!

Olivia playfully pinched Isabella's waist.

Isabella's eyes darkened, and she playfully tackled Olivia onto the bed. "You little rascal, you asked for it!"

The driver in the front seat wisely activated the soundproof partition and focused on driving.

That afternoon, Olivia went to the plaza to sell cold drinks as usual.

Isabella asked her, "With a sugar daddy, riding in a luxury car, and bodyguards in tow, aren't you worried people will find it pretentious?"

Olivia rolled her eyes at Isabella. "Who's got a sugar daddy? This is a normal relationship, okay? I'm just here to check out the auditions and have some fun. It's a good way to pass the time, and I can earn a little extra cash. Why not enjoy the excitement and make some money?"

"Always scheming, with the air of a small-time vendor," Isabella teased, poking Olivia's forehead.

"You're a big-time businessperson, and yet, aren't you still a merchant at heart? People say there's no business without deceit, so don't think you're any better," Olivia retorted.

Isabella leaned in closer to Olivia, grinning mischievously. "That's why we're two of a kind, partners in crime!"

"Ugh! Do you have to make it sound so bad? Who's partners in crime with you? You're the wolf; I'm definitely not the sidekick!" Olivia pushed Isabella's face away.

"Right, you're Little Red Riding Hood," Isabella chuckled.

Olivia shot Isabella a big eye roll. "Got nothing to do this afternoon?"

"Nope," Isabella said, staring straight at Olivia.

"Then help me sell drinks?" Olivia's plan had succeeded!

"No way!" Isabella refused immediately.

"Why not?" Olivia was puzzled.

"It's embarrassing!" Isabella turned her face away.

...

Olivia bit her lip, hesitated for a second, then opened the car door and waved at Isabella. "Isabella, do whatever you want, but don't interfere with me. And no sending bodyguards to buy drinks. That would make the money earned feel pointless. Don't worry, I'll be home on time and won't stay out overnight!"

"You wouldn't dare!" Isabella glared at Olivia menacingly. "If you dare stay out, I'll drag you back and give you a good spanking!"

Olivia stuck her tongue out playfully at Isabella and ran off.

Isabella watched Olivia's retreating figure and sighed. "That girl, why is she always so focused on making money? When will she ever think about spending mine?"

The driver overheard and nearly banged his chin on the steering wheel, secretly grumbling: In a world where men complain about women constantly asking for money, this Isabella actually laments that a woman isn't after his cash. It's true—one person's trash is another's treasure!

In truth, Olivia wasn't money-obsessed. She loved making money but always had her principles.

That afternoon, even though she wanted to spend time with Isabella, she chose to sell drinks because she couldn't abandon Sophie Cook.

No matter what, Sophie was her only sister. They'd relied on each other for five years, and even if Sophie was sometimes too much, it was because Olivia had spoiled her!

Isabella stayed in the car, working on her laptop while waiting for Olivia.

Two hours later, after finishing his work, Isabella realized Olivia hadn't returned. He rolled down the window, glanced at the bustling plaza, but still no sign of Olivia.

Frowning, Isabella checked his watch, then grabbed his large sunglasses, pushed open the car door, and stepped out.

Inside, the auditions were still ongoing, run by the assistant director of the production team. Staff screened participants based on registration criteria, calling them one by one into a small room for further evaluation on camera.

Upstairs, in the VIP room, Director Wang sat in front of a large screen, watching the assistant director's auditions.

Here, he could see each contestant's performance and, more importantly, observe if they were comfortable and natural on camera, matching the public's aesthetic preferences.

Director Wang was a gold medal director under the Billionaire Film Company, known for his harsh and picky nature. His last film had won the Best Actor award for its star.

"Knock, knock..."

"Who's there?"

Director Wang impatiently signaled his assistant to open the door. He hated being interrupted while working.

The door opened, and a bodyguard gestured respectfully. "Mr. Billionaire, please!"

"Director Wang, it's... it's our boss... Mr. Billionaire!" The assistant stammered in fear.

Director Wang fell off his chair in shock.

The legendary boss of the entertainment industry, the elusive "Billionaire," was here at the auditions?

Director Wang looked up to see a tall, handsome figure in the doorway, dressed in a black shirt and sharply creased pants, wearing large sunglasses that revealed only part of his face, with thin lips set in a stern line and a strong jaw.

No one had ever seen "Mr. Billionaire's" true face, but everyone knew this iconic image!

Director Wang scrambled to his feet, trembling. "Mr. Billionaire, how... how come you're here?"

"Just checking on your auditions," Mr. Billionaire said in a deep, emotionless voice.

Director Wang hurriedly wiped his chair before offering it to Mr. Billionaire. "Please, have a seat! We have a lot of great candidates today."

Mr. Billionaire sat down, watching silently.

Director Wang, standing nervously behind him, wiped his forehead with his sleeve and whispered to his assistant, "Quick, get Mr. Billionaire some coffee!"

"On it!"

The assistant dashed out, nearly colliding with Michael Wright at the door.

Michael grabbed the assistant by the collar, tossing him aside with a disdainful smirk.

Look at these guys, acting like mice before a cat when they see the young master. And this is supposed to be a top director? How'd he even get his job?

But when the young master got serious, even those close to him felt the chill.

Mr. Billionaire, CEO of the Billionaire Group, entertainment mogul, he owned the largest film company and top entertainment team, plus multiple brands in dining, fashion, and entertainment.

Who would have thought this enigmatic, awe-inspiring figure was none other than their beloved superstar, Tenyi?

And no one would ever connect this entertainment mogul to the real estate giant, Group Peterson!

Isabella's father, Mr. Peterson, had vehemently opposed Isabella's involvement in entertainment.

Isabella had come to the city alone and, in a few short years, created legends in IT, business, and entertainment.

From a young age, Isabella showed a unique talent for software development. As an adult, he founded his own software company, focusing on business management software development and maintenance.

After arriving in the city, he invested heavily in acquiring a film company, renamed it Billionaire Films, and became an entertainment mogul through sheer brilliance.

People were always curious about the connection between Tenyi and Billionaire Films, with some speculating they might be lovers.

After all, stories of producers or investors having secret relationships with actors weren't unheard of. But no one ever guessed they were the same person.

Isabella first established his entertainment company before diving into acting, simply because he couldn't imagine working for someone else as a big boss.

He used his company's top team to build himself into a superstar, endorsing only his own products, causing all of Billionaire's other industries to skyrocket.

As Olivia would say, "No business without deceit!"

But aside from his assistant, Amy Green, and bodyguard, Michael Wright, few knew all of Isabella's secret identities.

Even Mr. Peterson didn't know the rising business star "Mr. Billionaire" was his youngest son.

As for the superstar "Tenyi," he looked down on entertainers and wasn't even aware of such a person.

The assistant soon returned with coffee, which Director Wang eagerly offered to Isabella. "Mr. Billionaire, your coffee!"

Isabella remained seated, showing no interest.

Feeling awkward, Director Wang placed the coffee on the table, then nudged his assistant. "Fool! Mr. Billionaire doesn't drink instant coffee! Go brew a cup of Blue Mountain!"

The assistant scratched his head sheepishly. "I don't know how!"

"Then go buy some!"

The assistant hurried off, while Director Wang wiped his sweaty forehead again. "Mr. Billionaire..."

Isabella finally spoke, cold and calm, "Just do your job."

"Yes, yes!"

Director Wang dragged a small chair beside Isabella, nervously watching the auditions.

Once in work mode, he quickly forgot Mr. Billionaire's intimidating presence, critiquing mercilessly:

"Her skin isn't fair enough!"

"Her acting is too stiff!"

"Her mouth is too big!"

...

Isabella watched silently, finding it all rather dull.

Suddenly, a striking figure caught his attention on the screen, making Isabella sit up straight, his eyes lighting up like beacons in the night.

Who was this woman who could captivate Mr. Billionaire's attention?
