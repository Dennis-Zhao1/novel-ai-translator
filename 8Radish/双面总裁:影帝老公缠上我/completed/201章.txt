Title: Lost and Found

Tyler's icy blue eyes hid a mocking smile as he glanced at Sophie Cook. "So, you're saying this is her old flame? Have you ever met him?"

Sophie Cook shook her head earnestly. "Nah, I was just a twelve-year-old kid back then, busy with school and clueless about my sister's affairs. I only heard bits and pieces from the family."

"Alright then, spill whatever you know about your sister and this guy," Tyler said, setting down his sketchbook and fixing his gaze on Sophie Cook with a hint of intensity.

Sophie Cook felt her heart skip a beat under Tyler's unexpectedly heated stare. Wow, this guy's charm could definitely rival Isabella Peterson's!

Was he finally unable to contain his excitement?

Well, Sophie Cook was definitely overthinking it. Tyler was growing impatient, his urgency stemming from a desire to uncover the truth about the past, not from any interest in Sophie Cook's heavily made-up face.

He tapped his slender finger on the table, producing a steady tapping sound. 

Sophie snapped back to reality, her cheeks turning rosy. She quickly cast a side glance at Tyler's handsome profile and, feigning shyness, lowered her head with a coquettish voice, "I remember that summer, Mom got really sick..."

As she spoke, she blinked and squeezed out a couple of fake tears, much to Tyler's irritation. He wished he could just toss her out right then and there.

But Sophie was oblivious, continuing her act as the innocent, delicate damsel. "I took care of Mom every day, but my sister never came home. She claimed she was working to earn money for Mom's medical bills, but we never saw a dime. Later, I heard she left Mom to be with a man, supposedly to care for him, but really, she became his woman. The villagers looked down on her, and we couldn't even hold our heads up."

As Sophie recounted the story, Tyler couldn't help but clench his fists, a shadow crossing his handsome face.

Back then, he was bound to a wheelchair, completely unaware of the burden Olivia Stewart had carried.

"And then?" Tyler's words dripped with icy disdain as they slipped from his lips.

Sophie shivered involuntarily at the chill in his voice. This man, who seemed so calm, could be terrifying when angry.

But the angrier, the better!

Sophie couldn't resist a smirk. "What happened next? Well, the guy got better and ditched Olivia Stewart, of course!"

No, that's not how it happened! She left me, fearing the surgery's outcome, not even waiting for me to come out of the operating room!

Tyler's mind screamed, his face darkening as veins stood out on his forehead, pulsing with anger.

Sophie sneaked a glance at Tyler, fueling the fire. "You didn't know, did you? Olivia Stewart had a boyfriend back then! What man could accept being cheated on? So, her boyfriend dumped her too. My mom, already sick, was pushed to her limit and... well..."

Sophie couldn't continue, covering her face and crying dramatically, hoping Tyler would comfort her.

Tyler gripped Sophie's shoulders tightly. She felt a glimmer of hope and moved to lean into his embrace. But the force he applied left her immobilized, and she winced, "Tyler, you're hurting me!"

Tyler, indifferent to her discomfort, held her steady, his blue eyes cold and piercing. "So, Olivia Stewart had a boyfriend back then?" he demanded.

Sophie felt a surge of frustration. Olivia Stewart, why can't you just disappear?

"Yeah!" she replied, her eyes glinting with malicious delight. "She left her boyfriend for money, to nurse a paralyzed man, and ended up in his bed. Once he recovered, he left her high and dry!"

"You're lying!" Tyler roared, throwing Sophie aside.

With a thud, Sophie stumbled back, hitting the table corner. The pain broke her composure, and she lashed out at Tyler, "I'm not lying! Men like you are all blind! What's so great about Olivia Stewart? Why do you all protect her? Let me tell you, she only went with that man for money!"

Sophie dug through her bag and slammed a small wooden box on the table. "Look at this clay figurine. Doesn't it resemble the sketches you have? This is proof! It shows the man she was with, all for money, leaving her first love for that cripple!"

The accusation hit Tyler like a ton of bricks. He glared at Sophie, his blue eyes seething with anger.

This woman dared call him a cripple!

"And Olivia Stewart's not exactly innocent now, either. She's got a sugar daddy, or how else do you think she landed the lead role? Her sponsor, Isabella Peterson, is way out of your league. Keep obsessing over Olivia Stewart, and you'll regret it!" Sophie spat out her venomous words, grabbed her bag, and stormed off without a backward glance.

Tyler stood there, feeling as if his blood had turned to ice.

What parts of the past had he missed? How much had Olivia Stewart endured? How did she move on, change her name, and become someone new?

His mind was a tangled mess of conflicting memories.

With shaky hands, Tyler picked up the clay figurine from the box, his fingers trembling.

"Amy!" Amy Green entered, concern etched on her face. "Boss, are you alright?"

Tyler looked down at the clay figurine, imagining Olivia Stewart crafting it, her eyes surely shining with light as she worked. Slowly, a smile tugged at his lips.

No matter what, having these things back was invaluable. These were priceless memories left by Olivia Stewart, worth more than any amount of money.

Carefully, Tyler placed the sketches back into the wooden box, treating them as precious artifacts.

Amy watched, secretly sighing. The boss, so cold and aloof, was, in fact, deeply passionate when it came to love. Love, indeed, could be a dangerous game.

Sophie Cook, the schemer, had tried to smear Olivia Stewart's reputation but inadvertently did Tyler a huge favor. What would her face look like when the truth came out?

Tyler quickly secured the box, holding it close, and asked, "What's happening over there?"

"Uh..." Amy admitted, embarrassed, "The room's been closed off. I wandered around outside but didn't see or hear anything."

Alone together for so long? Tyler felt his anxiety spike and quickly headed out.

Ethan King had always been a unique figure in Olivia Stewart's life, one he needed to keep an eye on. 

Besides, what man isn't possessive of the woman he loves? If it weren't for the rocky start with Olivia Stewart back then, he'd have tracked down her so-called first love and given him a piece of his mind!

Amy wanted to say something more, but Tyler had already vanished. She hurried after him, not wanting to be left behind.

Exiting the café, Tyler climbed into his luxurious RV, placing the newly acquired wooden box into the fingerprint-locked safe.

The portable safe wasn't large, so Tyler tossed out a stack of files to make room.

"Boss..." Amy began, worried.

The files were crucial, encrypted documents. The safe was there to protect them, and now Tyler was tossing them out. A misstep could cost millions, or worse, bankrupt the company!

Tyler shot Amy a sharp look. "You keep an eye on it. Any mistakes, and you're responsible!"

Amy stumbled, nearly falling into a seat, wiping sweat from her forehead.

Boss, you're really trusting me with this? Aren't you afraid I'll pull a fast one?

As if reading her thoughts, Tyler added, "If you betray me, I guarantee you'll spend the rest of your life just drooling over pretty faces. Now, hurry up and get rid of that disguise!"

Before Amy could grab her multi-purpose work bag, Tyler had already ripped off the voice-modulating necklace, dialing Olivia Stewart. "Why aren't you home yet?"

"I’m just having coffee with a friend," Olivia Stewart replied. "Something came up, so I might be home late."
