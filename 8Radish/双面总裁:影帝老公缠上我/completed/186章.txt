**Who Stole the Memories of Yesteryear?**

Olivia Stewart's hand trembled violently, almost causing the small clay figurine to slip through her fingers. She quickly cupped her hands around it, staring at it intently for a long moment.

This wasn't just any clay figurine; it had been meticulously crafted and fired, so it hadn't warped from the dampness underground. Its features were strikingly clear—sharp eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a chiseled, princely face, almost like a Greek god stepping out of a painting.

The "prince" wore a distant, noble expression, with a hint of melancholy in his dark eyes.

Despite the completely different aura, Olivia instantly recognized who it resembled—Isabella Peterson!

Isabella Peterson!

Could it be that I actually knew him? Why can't I remember? Did I have amnesia, like in some cliché TV drama, and forget about him?

Olivia's mind was a whirlwind as she stared at the clay figure, thoughts racing through her head.

She shifted her attention to the wooden box, carefully lifting the damp, blurry sketch beneath the figurine. The paper had stuck together, but she could barely make out the handsome youth in the drawing.

There's a diary underneath, too. Maybe that holds the answers!

Olivia eagerly reached for the diary, but a sudden shout from above startled her: "What do you think you're doing?"

Startled, Olivia dropped the clay figurine back into the box. Disaster!

Before she could check if it was damaged, a large hand gripped her wrist tightly. Turning, she saw a stern, middle-aged man with a face as dark as thunder.

"What do you want?" Olivia snapped, trying to pull away but failing.

The man's face darkened even more, and he boomed, "You young people have no sense! Stealing ancient trees in broad daylight, and you have the nerve to ask me what I'm doing? I should be asking you!"

Olivia felt like she'd stepped into a bad sitcom, utterly speechless. She noticed his armband, indicating he was part of the neighborhood committee.

Taking a deep breath, she tried a different approach. "Sir, could you please let go? I was just looking for something. No way was I trying to steal a tree. Look at me—do I look like I could uproot a tree and carry it off?"

Seriously, steal a tree? That's absurd!

The man reconsidered, realizing his accusation was a bit much. But then his eyes landed on the hole under the tree, and he puffed up again, "Damaging the tree's environment is also wrong! You need to come with me to the neighborhood committee!"

Without waiting for a response, he dragged Olivia toward the gate.

"Wait, can I at least take my things?" Olivia pleaded, trying to hold onto the fence.

"No way! Prove it's yours! For all I know, you're here to loot artifacts!"

Olivia felt like she might just collapse in exasperation. This guy really liked to pin crimes on people. If not tree theft, then artifact theft. Did she look like a thief?

Reluctant to leave, Olivia found herself in a verbal tug-of-war with the man outside the fence, explaining that she used to live here and was just retrieving childhood trinkets, not anything valuable.

The man stubbornly insisted she had damaged the tree's environment and needed proof she was telling the truth.

Feeling trapped, Olivia finally admitted to the environmental damage, paid a $50 fine, and the man left satisfied.

"What a guy! If I'd known he just wanted some cash, I'd have paid sooner and saved my breath," Olivia muttered, climbing back over the fence to gather her things. But when she looked down, everything was gone.

The box—where was it?

Olivia spun around, searching the area, but the box had vanished.

Was this some kind of dream?

She rubbed her eyes, but the shovel and newly dug hole confirmed it wasn't imagined. Yet, there was no sign of the box.

Bending down, Olivia searched every inch of the area, finding nothing—not even a splinter of wood. Finally, she sat on the edge of a flowerbed, defeated.

What bad luck!

Who could have taken it? While she was arguing, someone must have sneaked off with it. But who? A mischievous kid or someone with ulterior motives?

Expanding her search, Olivia found no one, not even a passerby.

"Whoever took my stuff, you're in big trouble!" Olivia thought in frustration.

She returned to search the tree area, turning over every clump of earth but finding nothing more. Feeling hopeless and with the sky darkening, Olivia realized she had to catch the last bus back to town and reluctantly left.

As Olivia departed, a shadowy figure emerged from behind a building, holding the box with a sinister smile.

When Olivia returned home, she was totally deflated, feeling like a wilted lettuce leaf. Lucas Wright greeted her with a big smile.

"Hey, Olivia, you're back!"

"Yeah," she replied listlessly.

Lucas assumed she was just bored and quickly reported, "Olivia, the sunroom for your clay sculptures is ready. We've brought in the best clay from around the world. Want to check it out?"

"A sunroom for clay?" Olivia perked up. "When did Isabella put this together?"

Lucas led the way, explaining, "Olivia, to be honest, Isabella cares about you more than you know. He's just too proud to say it."

Olivia felt a pang in her chest, reminded of her unresolved questions about Isabella. If only she could uncover their past connection, it might bring them both some comfort. But...

Thinking of the beautifully crafted clay figurine, Olivia felt a sharp pain in her heart.

Following Lucas, Olivia arrived at the Mediterranean-style castle. Amidst the expanses of greenery, a beautiful glasshouse had been constructed in the sunniest spot.

If it were a greenhouse, it would add beauty to the land, but instead, it was filled with clay of various colors!

For someone as particular as Isabella to accept such an eccentric thing?

Recalling Lucas's earlier words, Olivia's questions faded, replaced by a warm feeling spreading through her heart.

Lucas opened the glass door, gesturing graciously, "After you, Olivia."

Inside, Olivia gasped, "Wow! This place is huge! A hundred square feet for clay? That's extravagant!"

Lucas followed, smiling silently.

For anything Olivia liked, Isabella spared no expense.

As Olivia wandered, she admired the sunroom's design. The walls featured diverse glass shapes, and a high dome overhead offered a view of the setting sun. The glass, crafted with some unknown technique, was clear and detailed without being harsh on the eyes.

Not just for clay—this sunroom was a giant kaleidoscope of beauty!

Olivia was captivated, exclaiming, "This sunroom is like a piece of art. Isabella, you're amazing! I love you!"

Lucas, tasked with getting Olivia's reaction, was secretly texting Isabella updates. As soon as Olivia finished her exclamation, Lucas sent her words off with a ping.

Hearing the sound, Olivia turned, catching Lucas on his phone. Curious, she teased, "Didn't know you liked playing on your phone! Do you play games too?"

"Uh, no, no, just work messages," Lucas replied awkwardly, quickly pocketing his phone.
