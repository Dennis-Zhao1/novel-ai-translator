Olivia Stewart was completely wasted, but somewhere in her foggy brain, she knew this wasn't right. She tried to push Isabella Peterson away, but her arms felt like noodles, and her feeble attempts only seemed to invite more advances. Eventually, she lost her balance and ended up clinging to Isabella instead.

Isabella's eyes, dark and intense, flickered with a dangerous crimson, like a brewing storm ready to engulf everything.

Olivia gasped, feeling her breath thinning out, as if she was being enveloped in an unmistakably familiar scent. It was the same scent she remembered from earlier that day when Isabella nearly overwhelmed her.

No, this couldn't happen!

Olivia's muddled mind managed to work just enough to take advantage of a brief pause in Isabella's assault. She turned her head sharply and exclaimed, "Ugh, I'm gonna puke!"

Isabella immediately backed off, watching Olivia's scrunched-up face with an unexpected pang of concern.

"Get her some ginger ale, quick!" Isabella ordered, and a bodyguard promptly handed over a can. Just as Isabella was about to help Olivia drink it, she noticed Olivia wasn't about to throw up at all. Instead, she was giggling, tossing peanuts into the can, and playfully mimicking rabbit ears with her fingers while singing a silly song about feeling cute and spreading happiness.

The bodyguards around them struggled to keep straight faces, turning away to hide their chuckles.

This little trickster!

Isabella's expression darkened, and his lips pressed into a thin line. He leaned closer to Olivia, holding the ginger ale, ready to sober her up quickly.

Just as he was about to pour it over her head, Olivia tilted her face up unexpectedly, her cheek brushing against his knuckles. The soft, warm feel of her skin made him freeze in place.

Olivia looked at him, her eyes sparkling like diamonds, filled with mischief. "Hey, crazy!" she called out playfully.

So, she was calling out that flamboyant guy!

Isabella's eyes turned icy, and he started tilting the ginger ale again.

"You won't believe it, I saw this super hot guy today, like, drop-dead gorgeous!" Olivia babbled on.

Isabella paused, hand hovering in mid-air.

"But, ugh, he's kind of a jerk."

Calling him a jerk? This little thing had some nerve!

The corners of Isabella's mouth, which had started to curl up, flattened out again. His face was now as rigid as a plank.

"But he was so hot I almost screamed! He was like that movie star, Ethan King, a total heartthrob. You know what?" Olivia leaned in closer, whispering conspiratorially, "Today, I almost pounced on him! No, wait, he almost pounced on me. Why was I being so reserved? I totally regret not going with the flow now!"

Isabella watched Olivia's face crumple in frustration, and despite himself, he couldn't help but smile again. He pulled out his phone, recording her confession. "Sweetheart, say that again, for the record!"

Half an hour later, Olivia's eyes began to clear, recognition dawning on her face.

"Whoa, Isabella Peterson?" she finally mumbled.

This little thing finally remembered him.

"Well, I'll be damned!"

"No swearing!"

"No drinking outside!"

"No flirting with other guys!"

The trio of prohibitions hit Olivia like a ton of bricks, leaving her head spinning like a buzzing fly. She squinted at Isabella's ridiculously handsome face, her half-dazed eyes narrowing, "Other guys off-limits, but what about you?"

"I’m the exception," Isabella replied smugly, looking as if she should be thanking him on her knees.

Olivia burst out laughing. This guy's self-confidence was off the charts.

"Why do you care? Who made you the boss of me?"

"Because I'm your man, and it's my duty to guide you," Isabella declared with a tone of absolute certainty.

This arrogant, overbearing jerk!

Olivia rolled her eyes, "That whole thing earlier was just a misunderstanding, okay? You were getting pressured into marriage, and I helped you out. We should be square."

"You cost me a wife, how's that square?"

"I can explain it for you, right now!"

"I've already broken off the engagement with Mia White."

"Oh, I'm sorry, really! I didn't mean to! I just walked into the wrong room."

"Doesn't matter the reason, the damage is done. Now let's discuss compensation."

"Uhh... how much do you want? Though, I'm pretty broke, I even share a place with someone."

Mentioning her roommate situation triggered Isabella's imagination, picturing Olivia and her flamboyant roommate Ethan King flirting all day. He was suddenly furious, his voice turning frosty, "I don't need your money!"

"That's a relief!" Olivia sighed, her face lighting up in a smile. But her relief was short-lived, as she suddenly panicked, "No money? Are you going to send me to jail? Help, someone! Ethan, where are you?"

Olivia looked around nervously. The table they were at was surrounded by Isabella's bodyguards, isolating them from the bustling outside world. No wonder Isabella felt bold enough to kiss her in public without Ethan showing up—he must have been detained by them.

Olivia stood up, bowing repeatedly to Isabella, "Mister, I'm sorry! Please, don't hurt Ethan King. He knows nothing. It was all my fault, although I didn't mean it. I'll apologize, I'll even bring your bride back if you want!"

"No way!"

Isabella's refusal was swift, and his eyes grew colder. Even now, she was concerned about that flamboyant guy. Just how important was he to her?

Realizing that playing nice wasn't working, Olivia decided to change tactics. She folded her arms, sitting back down defiantly, "What do you want, then?"

"It's simple. Didn't you say you were pregnant with my kid? Just give birth to it; my mom's been wanting a grandchild."

The mention of Isabella's mom made Olivia shiver, "You know that pregnancy was fake. How am I supposed to give you a kid? Unless..."

Isabella watched her eagerly as she continued, "Unless you're okay with wearing a green hat!"

Isabella's face darkened instantly. Normally, wouldn't someone suggest making a baby together? This girl never took the usual route.

Seeing Isabella's dark expression, Olivia couldn't help but mock, "To please your son-loving mom, you'd even accept such a plan?"

Isabella stared at her, infuriated yet amused, his lips curling into a wicked grin, "Let's not rush the kid thing. You lost me a wife, so how about compensating me with a wedding night?"

This guy, looking all cool and composed, yet he had such a shameless side!

Was it true what they said, the more handsome a guy, the more of a jerk he was?

Olivia's mouth hung open, and it took her a moment to find words, "Are you really that desperate for a woman?"

"Not desperate, just picky."

"I'm even pickier! Isabella Peterson, don't think you're all that just because you're handsome! I complimented you because you remind me of Ethan King, my favorite star. I'm a huge fan of his, totally head over heels! As for you, it’s just by association. But now, seeing how much of a jerk you are, I've decided to look down on you!"

"Is that so?" Isabella's eyes narrowed, watching Olivia's animated lips, his question loaded with meaning.

Before Olivia could respond, he added slowly, "I thought you'd be eager to get me into bed."

"Pfft—"

Olivia spat out in laughter, causing Isabella to dodge, looking disgusted. A bodyguard rushed over with a towel, but Isabella waved him off.

"Me, wanting to sleep with you?" Olivia pointed at herself incredulously, "You've got to be kidding! I'd rather sleep with a pig than with you!"

Comparing him to a pig!

Or worse, less than a pig!

Isabella's face turned a shade of green, looking more unpleasant than eating ten helpings of something disgusting. His lips tightened into a white line, and he bit out, "Didn't a certain someone say she regretted not letting me pounce on her today?"

Did she really say that?

Olivia felt both mortified and doubtful as she patted her burning cheeks. She must have blacked out from drinking too much, she couldn't recall anything!

Seeing her stubborn denial, Isabella silently played the video on his phone. There, a drunken Olivia was lamenting, "I almost let Isabella Peterson pounce on me, just missed the chance..."

Olivia covered her face with both hands, wishing she could disappear under the table.

Ugh, so embarrassing, she could die!

But Isabella wasn't letting her off the hook. He placed the phone in front of her, gently prying her fingers away, "Look, really look. Who's this woman wanting to pounce on me?"

"I don't know her!" Olivia blustered, determined to weasel her way out, "I don't remember anything from when I was drunk!"

"Well, they say drunken words are sober thoughts. What you say drunk is what you really want to do."

Olivia covered her face again, "Uh... well, you know, I was just talking, heh!"

"I'm giving you a chance to make your dreams come true!"
