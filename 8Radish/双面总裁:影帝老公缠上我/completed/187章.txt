Lucas Wright, the ever-dutiful butler, found himself in a bit of a pickle. He had been sneakily filming Olivia Stewart and sending videos to Isabella Peterson. But now, caught off guard by Olivia's teasing, he had to think on his feet. "Olivia, I apologize for disturbing you during work hours. It's my fault," he said with a dramatic bow.

Olivia laughed it off, assuring him, "Lucas, don't be so serious. Isabella isn't here, and I won't tell him. But..." She leaned in closer, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Are you chatting with some lady on WhatsApp?"

Lucas's face turned beet red, hotter than a sunburn. "N-no, it's not what you think..." He muttered, unable to find his usual eloquence.

Seeing his discomfort, Olivia quickly apologized, "Sorry, Lucas, I was just curious. But, you know, if there's someone special, don't hesitate. We all support you. I could even ask Isabella for some time off for you!"

Lucas waved his hands frantically, "No, no, Olivia, thank you, but I'll talk to him myself. Let's focus on this sunroom. Anything else we need?"

Olivia shifted her attention back to the impressive sunroom, packed with sophisticated pottery tools and exotic clays. She marveled at the jade carving knife, putting it down carefully after Lucas informed her it was platinum with diamond edges. "Wow, this is way too fancy for me," she exclaimed, awed and slightly intimidated by the luxurious setup.

"But Olivia, these are custom-made for you. If anything breaks or doesn't work, we can replace it," Lucas reassured her, hinting at Isabella's affection and indulgence.

"Isabella's okay with me messing around here? He's usually such a neat freak!" Olivia mused, finally relaxing into the space's opulence.

Meanwhile, at the company, Isabella Peterson, ever the stoic CEO, was in the middle of a high-stakes meeting. His attention, however, was split between the presentations and his phone. His demeanor was as sharp as ever until a notification pinged. It was a video from Lucas, showing Olivia's delighted expression in the sunroom.

Isabella's face softened, and he couldn't help but smile as he replayed the video. Olivia's cheerful declaration, "I love you, Isabella!" echoed in his ears like a sweet melody, a sentiment that brightened his day.

The meeting room fell silent, awaiting Isabella's reaction. His unexpected joy was contagious, and the tension eased as the executives exchanged puzzled glances. What could make their usually stern boss so happy?

Isabella, lost in the moment, kept replaying Olivia's video. The room watched in awe, not daring to interrupt his reverie. Was the formidable CEO in love? It seemed so, and the realization brought a collective sigh of relief.

After several blissful replays, Isabella snapped back to reality, masking his embarrassment with a cough. "Continue," he ordered, slipping an earbud in to keep listening discreetly.

As the meeting proceeded, Isabella's thoughts wandered back to Olivia. Her spontaneous expression of affection had him contemplating how quickly he could finish work and spend the weekend with her. The rest of the meeting blurred by as he floated on a cloud of happiness, eagerly anticipating their next encounter.
