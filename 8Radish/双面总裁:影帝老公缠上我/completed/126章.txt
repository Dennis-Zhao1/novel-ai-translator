Title: Secrets in the Castle

Amy Green deftly dodged out of the way and jumped into the driver's seat, ready to speed off. Isabella Peterson wrinkled her nose at the overpowering cologne scent clinging to her clothes and kicked the back of Amy's seat. "Step on it!"

All Isabella wanted was to get home and wash off the cloying fragrance. Ever since Olivia Stewart mentioned preferring his natural scent, he'd grown to despise cologne. If he weren't worried about Olivia getting suspicious during close encounters, he'd have ditched it altogether.

The luxury RV roared away from the hospital, and Amy Green raced against time, barely managing to drop Isabella off at the Water's Edge mansion before Olivia Stewart returned.

To maintain his cover, Isabella drove his own sports car into the estate. Once inside, he tossed the car keys to a security guard and bolted upstairs, desperate for a shower.

Minutes later, Olivia Stewart arrived back at the mansion. Michael Wright, who'd been anxiously watching for Isabella's car, sighed in relief. The delay had provided just enough time for a quick change. Still, he couldn't help but wonder how exhausting it must be for Isabella to constantly switch roles. What would Olivia do if she ever found out?

Ah, but Isabella always had a plan.

Michael hopped out and opened the car door for Olivia with a respectful nod. "Welcome back, Olivia."

Yet, Olivia hesitated, reluctant to step out. Michael noticed her burnt leg and offered, "Should I fetch Isabella to carry you inside?"

"No, no, that's okay! I can manage," Olivia quickly replied, scrambling out of the vehicle. She didn't want Isabella to see her like this, with her torn pants revealing a haphazardly bandaged leg.

"Go on, do your thing. I'll be fine," she said, using a prop tablecloth to cover her ripped trousers as she dashed into the castle.

Michael watched her go with a bemused expression. For someone supposedly injured, she sure moved like a rabbit. Isabella’s concern seemed overblown.

Inside the grand hall, Olivia raced upstairs, nearly colliding with Lucas Wright, the head butler.

"Olivia?"

"Lucas, is Isabella back?"

"Yes, he just returned and is in his room. But Olivia, what happened to you?"

"Nothing, really. I just liked this tablecloth pattern from the set today and brought it home. I'll return it tomorrow. Oh, and please, don't tell Isabella!"

"Don't tell me what?" came the familiar, chilly voice from above her. Olivia plopped down on the stairs in surprise, looking up to see Isabella standing there, wearing a loosely tied gray robe, his hair still wet from the shower.

Caught off guard, Olivia put on her best appeasing smile. "Hey, Isabella, you're home early today!"

"Early enough to see your creative use of table linens."

Isabella had hurried to clean off the cologne, planning to carry Olivia inside, only to find she'd sprinted in on her own, trying to keep him in the dark. The doctor had advised rest, but she seemed to ignore that advice.

Isabella's frustration grew. He’d held back earlier, but now he could properly express his irritation.

As he descended the staircase, Olivia watched nervously, shrinking back and accidentally tumbling down a couple of steps. Fortunately, the fall was cushioned by a soft carpet, leaving her more embarrassed than hurt.

Isabella rushed to her side, his eyes flashing with worry for a split second before anger took over again. "Olivia Stewart!" he growled, lifting her like a bag of feathers and depositing her on the couch.

Her makeshift cover fell away, revealing the torn pant leg. "I can explain!" she stammered, trying to pull the fabric together.

"Start talking," Isabella commanded.

Feeling awkward, Olivia tried to smooth over the situation. "Well... it looks bad, but it's not what you think! I, um..."

"Get to the point!"

She sighed, "I ripped my pants on a nail. I was worried you'd be upset if you saw, so..."

Still hiding the truth, she thought.

Isabella suddenly grabbed her ankle, pulling her closer. Olivia tried to pull away, but he held her fast, tearing the pants leg further to reveal the burn.

Olivia flushed with embarrassment and swatted at him. "You're a jerk!"

But Isabella easily caught her hands, staring at the burn with a mix of frustration and worry.

"Who gave you the courage to lie to me?" he demanded.

"It was an accident," she whispered, her eyes filling with tears.

Seeing her distress, Isabella released her with a sigh. "Olivia, I've never met anyone as stubborn as you. Do you think Sophie Cook would thank you for protecting her?"

Olivia blinked in surprise. "You knew?"

"There's nothing in this town I don't know."

So he was aware of everything, even her interactions with her co-star. No wonder he was upset. She scrambled to reassure him, "Isabella, there's nothing between me and him outside of work! You said you wouldn't get jealous. Besides, he doesn't even like women like that, trust me!"

Fed up, Isabella ruffled her hair, making a mess of it. "Can't you tell when someone wants to harm you? Why not fight back?"

Was he not jealous?

Feeling a wave of warmth at his concern, Olivia grinned and hugged his arm. "You're not mad anymore?"

"How can you smile after all this?" he grumbled, trying to shake her off but stopping when he saw her hopeful expression.

"Olivia, take care of yourself. You're mine, and no one, not even you, should hurt you."

She nodded eagerly. "Got it. I won't let it happen again."

Isabella tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Listen, Sophie Cook isn't worth your loyalty. If she tries anything again, you retaliate. If not, I will."

"Please don't," Olivia pleaded, clutching his hand. "Let me handle it."

"It's not that I want to interfere. If not for you, she'd already be..." He trailed off, punching the sofa cushion in frustration.

"I know you're worried about me, and I appreciate it. I realize now that Sophie changed after that audition." Olivia's voice wavered as tears started to fall.

Isabella watched, his expression softening despite his frustration. He might be angry, but he couldn't deny his care for her.
