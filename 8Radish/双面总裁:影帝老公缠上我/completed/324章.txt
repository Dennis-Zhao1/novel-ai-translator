"Don't Disrespect the Word 'Mom'"

Ethan White quickly grabbed Grace Martin's wrist before Olivia Stewart could say anything about sitting down. He gently led Grace to the couch and patted her shoulder. "Chloe Wright, calm down. Let me explain to her," he said with a reassuring nod.

Grace Martin, tears in her eyes, nodded in agreement.

Ethan pulled out a stack of papers from his briefcase and handed them to Olivia Stewart. For once, a serious expression crossed his face as he spoke in a low, steady voice. "Olivia Stewart, there's something important I need to tell you. You're not the illegitimate child of me and Sophia Allen. You're actually the legitimate daughter of Grace Martin and me, the rightful heiress of the White family."

Even though the White family had fallen, Ethan spoke with a proud stance and a hint of nostalgia.

"Are you serious? Does Mr. White enjoy coming to my house to tell jokes?" Olivia scoffed, clearly dismissing Ethan's words as nonsense.

"I'm not lying to you!" Ethan insisted, his face lined with age and worry.

He continued, "When you were just a baby, your mother took a trip back to the countryside. James Cook was a distant relative of their family. After Sophia Allen married him, she had a daughter there too. During a visit, your mother had a disagreement with Sophia Allen."

"After returning home, your mom discovered her heirloom bracelet was missing. At the time, she thought she lost it on the road and cried multiple times over it. It wasn't until she saw it on your wrist that she realized Sophia Allen had stolen it during that visit."

"But that wasn't the worst of it. Sophia Allen didn't just steal the bracelet; she swapped you with her daughter. That bracelet was meant to bring you safety, hung around your waist. You and Mia White were born just twenty days apart, and the caregiver didn't notice the switch. She kept it a secret, and that's how the misunderstanding persisted."

"Really? Quite the story you've concocted, Mr. White!" Olivia sneered, her lips curling in disbelief. "What kind of mother wouldn't notice if her child was switched?"

"I'm sorry, Olivia Stewart!" Grace Martin interjected. "When you were born a girl, the White family didn't pay much attention to you. And I, caught up in your father's entanglements with Sophia Allen, was too exhausted to care for you properly. It's my fault! But please, give me a chance to make it up to you, okay?"

Olivia ignored Grace Martin's pleas, finding the word "mom" coming from her mouth especially ironic. If Grace was truly her mother, it was more painful than anything else.

Ethan, seeing Olivia's silence, pushed the documents closer to her. "Child, look at this! These are the results of a paternity test. We didn't realize the truth until the doctor suspected something from your kidney match. The test revealed this shocking truth."

Olivia took the papers, her heart racing. She wanted to tear them up but found herself unable to look away. The results showed a 99.99999% DNA match between Olivia Stewart and Grace Martin, confirming their relationship. Meanwhile, Mia White's match with Grace was only around 40%, showing no blood relation.

How could this be?

Olivia's hands trembled, and the documents slipped from her grasp, scattering across the floor.

Ethan stood up, "Child, we—"

"Don't come near me!" Olivia shouted, waving them away as if they were a threat. No, no, no, this must be a mistake! How could she have parents like them?

Grace Martin, seeing Olivia's resistance, felt her heart break. Tearfully, she pleaded, "Olivia Stewart, please, for the sake of my kidney disease, call me mom just once?"

"Call you mom? You think you're worthy?" Olivia's voice was sharp as she suddenly realized, "Oh, I get it! You're trying to get me to donate a kidney, aren't you? To get a donor, you've concocted this ridiculous story of switched babies!"

Ethan and Grace exchanged bewildered looks.

They never expected Olivia to interpret things this way!

But given their previous desperate attempts to persuade Olivia to donate a kidney, who could blame her for being skeptical?

Ethan, desperate, said, "Olivia Stewart, we're not lying! We found the caregiver from back then, but she fled, afraid of being held accountable. Please, look at this test result, it's clearly written. You are our daughter!"

Olivia's face turned cold. "In this day and age, what can't be faked? Even parents can be fake, let alone a paternity test."

Ethan was at a loss for words, silenced by her retort.

Grace Martin, pale and tearful, begged, "Olivia Stewart, if you don't want to donate a kidney to save me, I won't blame you. I just want a chance to make it up to you!"

"Shut up!" Olivia slammed her hand on the table, her chest heaving with anger. "Mrs. White, don't desecrate the word 'mom'! From your mouth, it sounds disgusting!"

"Even if the paternity test is real, so what? What right do you have to call yourself my mom? Have you ever seen a mother who'd have someone run over her daughter with a car? Or have bodyguards attack her? Or throw acid at her? If I hadn't been lucky, I'd be dead by your hands many times over!"

Grace Martin's face turned ashen, cold sweat dripping from her forehead.

Regret filled her heart—why did it come to this?

Olivia's chest rose and fell with each breath, refusing to look at them again. She spat out a single word, "Leave!"

Ethan had no choice but to support the heartbroken Grace Martin as they left in disgrace.

Watching their retreating figures, Olivia clutched her chest and struggled to get up, intending to take her medication.

Anger and frustration weighed heavily on her, like a dark cloud pressing down. She feared she couldn't hold on much longer.

Just as she lifted her leg, a scream came from upstairs, "Oh no! Miss Emma is missing!"

Olivia's steps faltered, and she pressed her hand to her forehead, looking at the frantic housekeeper rushing down the stairs. "What's going on?"

The housekeeper trembled, nearly stumbling down the stairs. In a tearful voice, she reported, "Earlier, everyone was downstairs, worried that Mr. White might bully you. I went upstairs to check on Miss Emma, but found her bed empty!"

Olivia pressed her hand to her heart, taking deep breaths. "Check everywhere! She's little and can't walk. Maybe someone took her down the other staircase to play outside?"

"Yes, Miss Olivia!" The housekeeper hurried away.

Originally intending to go upstairs to take medication, Olivia's focus shifted entirely to Emma's disappearance.

She turned and rushed outside, trying to suppress the turmoil inside her as she ran.

Who could have taken Emma?

Please, let her be safe!

Half an hour later, a group of staff and guards returned with Emma, along with Tommy.

Everyone's faces were a mix of confusion and concern.

Olivia, barely holding herself together, asked, "What happened?"

The silence was deafening as no one answered.

Olivia raised her voice, "I asked you a question, didn't you hear me?"

David Wright stepped forward, lowering his head as he said, "It was young master Tommy who took Miss Emma. When we found him, he was about to throw her into the swan pond!"

Olivia's vision went black, her finger trembling as she pointed at Tommy. "Is it true?"

Tommy remained silent, a glint of resentment in his eyes.

That look of hatred was a mirror image of Alexander Peterson's!

In a fit of anger, Olivia slapped Tommy across the face. "Emma is your sister! How could you be so heartless? Just as ruthless as your father, with no regard for family!"

Tommy turned and ran away.

Watching his retreating back, Olivia's vision blurred. She swayed and collapsed.

"Olivia Stewart! Olivia Stewart!" The housekeepers screamed, rushing to her side.

But Olivia was unconscious, her face devoid of color.

"Step aside!" 

A gust of wind swept through, pushing the housekeepers and guards aside. Alexander Peterson's tall figure appeared, scooping up Olivia in his arms and rushing away before anyone could react.

He had been in a board meeting when he got the call from David Wright about Ethan and Grace Martin's visit, claiming Olivia was their daughter. Sensing something was wrong, he abandoned the meeting and sped home.

Halfway there, another call came about Emma's disappearance, prompting him to floor the gas pedal. Upon arriving, he found Olivia collapsed on the ground.

"Olivia, you have to hold on, don't scare me! Olivia..." Alexander's voice shook with fear.

"Call a doctor! Now!" he roared, eyes blazing with urgency.

Quickly, he carried Olivia back to the grand hall. After examining her, the doctor shook his head gravely and knelt before Alexander. "Master, Olivia fainted due to emotional stress. Physically, she's fine, but she's under such mental strain that it might trigger depression!"
