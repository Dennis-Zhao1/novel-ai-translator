Oops, I Accidentally Exposed His Little Secret

The hotel room was way too quiet.

"Uh, no, no, what I meant was..."

Olivia Stewart was at a complete loss for words. Honestly, she didn't even know what to say, but the awkwardness of being in a room with just the two of them was unbearable. She felt like she had to say something, anything.

Tian Yi suddenly leaned in closer to Olivia Stewart and asked, "Are you nervous?"

"…"

"Afraid I'll eat you up?"

Olivia shook her head vigorously. "No, no, no, I know I'm not your type. I'm just worried that... my partner might hear about this and misunderstand."

This girl, at least she knows her place!

Tian Yi's mood lifted immediately, and he decided to mess with Olivia a bit. "Then tell me, what type am I into?"

"Like Amy Green? Or maybe..."

Olivia wanted to say Isabella Peterson but thought better of it, swallowing her words and changing to, "Maybe someone like Mike?"

Amy Green? Mike? What in the world?

Tian Yi blinked, processing the images of the two before realization dawned on him. He leaned even closer to Olivia, gritting his teeth. "What did you say?"

"Uh..."

Did she accidentally spill the beans? Rumors about Tian Yi having a "special friendship" with Mike were apparently true! But did she just accidentally expose his secret to his face? Would he get mad?

Olivia leaned back, her head hitting the back of the sofa, realizing she had nowhere left to retreat. She couldn't bear to look at Tian Yi's furious eyes, her gaze darting everywhere as she frantically tried to think of a way out. "I, I mean, I don't discriminate against—I have a good friend, a flamboyant guy, maybe I can introduce you..."

Finally got rid of that drama queen, and now you want to introduce another one!?

Tian Yi grabbed Olivia's chin, leaning in...

At that moment, he didn't care about anything else—he just wanted to prove his orientation.

Olivia stared at the magnified handsome face in front of her, her mind blanking out, forgetting even to struggle, just staring wide-eyed.

One centimeter, half a centimeter...

"Boss, I brought the medicine back!"

With Amy Green's urgent shout, the door swung open suddenly. The expression on Amy's face was a masterpiece of shock and confusion as she took in the scene on the sofa.

Whoa, these two were moving fast!

Was it Olivia's weak will, or did the boss lose control?

"Ahem... sorry, I didn't see anything!"

Amy hurriedly placed the medicine on the table and quickly retreated. "Uh, you two continue discussing the script. I'll keep watch outside!"

Olivia snapped back to reality, her face turning crimson as she shoved Tian Yi away forcefully. Tian Yi frowned slightly, a brief flash of awkwardness crossing his face, but he quickly regained composure as if nothing had happened.

He stood up, picked up the ointment from the table, and twisted it open, ready to apply it to Olivia's bruised leg.

"I'll do it myself!" Olivia reached out to take it, but Tian Yi ignored her, pressing the swab soaked in ointment against her swollen leg.

"Ow—"

Olivia gasped in pain.

This guy was way too heavy-handed! Was this payback for accidentally exposing his secret? Talk about petty, just like Isabella Peterson!

Hearing Olivia's gasp, Tian Yi immediately lightened his touch, gently and evenly applying the ointment to her swollen leg. Then he switched to a new swab and applied it again with great care.

The cool sensation from the ointment replaced the earlier burning pain, and Olivia leaned back on the sofa, clasping her hands behind her head, letting out a satisfied sigh.

Tian Yi's hand froze, his blue eyes deepening.

This little vixen!

"Snap!"

The wooden stick of the swab broke in Tian Yi's hand.

Realizing her mistake, Olivia quickly sat up straight.

Tian Yi discarded the broken swab and handed Olivia the remaining ointment. "Take this and don't lose it! I've already arranged for your butler to pick you up. You don't need to return to the set today, or even the next couple of days!"

"Are you trying to get me kicked off the set?"

Olivia exclaimed.

"I didn't mean to, and besides, I don't even know the big shot from Billion Films. I just heard about your thing with Mike from others. I really didn't mean to expose your secret! Please don't hold it against me, Tian Yi! From what I've seen these past few days, you don't hate me that much, maybe we could even be besties?"

Who wants to be besties with you!

Tian Yi clenched his fists so tightly his knuckles turned white. He wanted to crack open Olivia's head to see what was going on inside!

He had gone to great lengths to hide his relationship with Mike, but this little creature thought otherwise... Seriously, what the heck!

Tian Yi's lips pressed into a thin line as he looked at Olivia, enunciating each word, "Listen carefully, I'll say it once: there's nothing wrong with my orientation. If you need proof, I can provide it anytime!"

"Oh, I get it. Don't worry, I promise there won't be a next time!"

Olivia nodded earnestly like a compliant child. But inside, she was thinking: Denial is just a way of covering up the truth!

If Tian Yi knew what she was thinking, he might have pounced on her right then and there.

"Let's go, I'll take you home."

Tian Yi tossed a tablecloth over Olivia's legs and leaned down to lift her up.

Ever since confirming Tian Yi's orientation, Olivia felt more at ease with their close contact. She naturally wrapped her arms around Tian Yi's neck, only realizing when they neared the door. "Wait, did you say you're taking me home?"

"Yeah."

"No, no, no!"

"Don't worry, I'm not taking you back. Your butler will pick you up, so your partner won't get jealous!"

"No, I mean, I just started shooting today. I don't want to get kicked off the set so soon. Tian Yi, I already apologized. Can you cut me some slack?"

"Fool!"

Tian Yi couldn't help but flick Olivia's forehead.

"I'm not kicking you off. Just giving you a few days to rest. Don't worry, I'll talk to the crew."

"That's great, thank you, Tian Yi! Mwah!"

Overjoyed, Olivia mimed a kiss in the air while hugging Tian Yi's neck.

Tian Yi's face turned a series of colors.

This girl, does she have no boundaries with other men?

Better deal with you when we get back!

Tian Yi tightened his grip on Olivia and quickened his pace.

Little did he know, in Olivia's mind, he was already in the same category as her flamboyant friend, all marked as potential besties.

At the door, Amy Green was precariously balancing a stack of multicolored photos and frames, almost reaching his chin. Seeing Tian Yi, he beamed like he’d found a savior, "Boss, these are all for your autograph!"

Tian Yi, carrying Olivia, breezed past Amy Green, leaving him with, "You collect them, you sign them!"

Amy Green was on the verge of tears. "Boss, I only promised those angel fans to get you out of a jam. Help me out here!"

The young master chose to ignore him completely.

Out of options, Amy Green scurried after Tian Yi, struggling with the pile of memorabilia.

When they reached the hospital, a group of women eagerly surrounded Amy Green, all clamoring for their signed photos. "Is mine ready?"

"And mine, the one with the blue border!"

"I want the pink one…"

It was said that one woman was as noisy as five hundred ducks. Imagine a whole flock!

Amy Green, head pounding, still managed a friendly smile. "Please wait, lovely angels, just a few more minutes. I'll take these to the car for signing and be right back!"

"Make it quick!"

"Promise! I promise!"

Finally escaping the throng of admirers, Amy Green dashed to the RV parked outside the hospital. Inside, Tian Yi was tapping his fingers on the armrest, a sign of his growing impatience.

Amy Green, ever the sycophant, grinned. "Hehe, boss, where's Olivia?"

"Already sent her home with Michael Wright."

Amy Green dumped the pile of photos onto the RV's carpet and began signing away furiously. "Boss, just give me a few minutes!"

"If I'm not at the makeup removal before Olivia reaches home, you can say goodbye to women for life!"

So harsh?

"Clatter!"

The pen slipped from Amy's hand.

After a moment of shock, he picked it up and resumed signing with a vengeance.

A few minutes later, Amy Green finished up the autographs and, on the way to deliver the photos, called Michael Wright to suggest he drive Olivia slowly, maybe encourage her to enjoy the scenery or do some shopping.

The excited fans who received their signed photos from Amy had no idea that the signatures came from his assistant, not the idol himself. Tian Yi had never personally signed a photo since his debut.

Back in the RV, Amy Green meticulously helped Tian Yi remove his makeup. Once the extra embellishments were gone, the fair-skinned, strikingly handsome idol transformed into the aloof and formidable heir, Isabella Peterson.

Amy Green eyed Isabella with admiration. "Boss, you're such a heartbreaker for young girls. No wonder Olivia is so smitten with you!"

Isabella kicked him playfully. "Get lost!"
