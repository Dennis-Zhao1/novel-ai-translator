**The Kids' Battle**

Gwen glanced nervously at Toby and tugged at Cody's sleeve, whispering, "Cody, let's just go! I don't want to be friends with him anymore. He's scary!"

Cody shook off Gwen's hand, his eyes blazing as he stared at Toby. "No way, Gwen. He has to apologize! No one gets to bully you, not anyone!"

Gwen's sweet, soft calls for her brother and Cody's protective stance for his sister were enough to rile up Toby. After all, he was their brother too. Why did they treat him like an enemy?

Toby's gaze was cold, a mocking smirk playing on his lips. He stood there, unmoved. He wasn’t going to apologize, no matter what.

The atmosphere was tense, and an uncomfortable silence filled the air until it was broken by a cheerful voice.

"Little Miss, Little Master, breakfast is ready!"

The cheerful call of a staff member interrupted the standoff, as they entered with trays of food. Earlier, Gwen had insisted on trying a bit of everything, so the staff had to bring extra help to carry all the plates. They thought the kids would enjoy themselves in the dining room, oblivious to the simmering tension.

The three kids stood with their faces taut, not saying a word. The staff, sensing something was off, approached cautiously. Cody stood defiantly with clenched fists, while Toby smirked coolly—a clear sign of a spat between kids.

It was tricky for the staff, who didn't want to offend any of the young masters or misses. So they pretended not to notice the tension and bent down to Gwen with a gentle smile. "Little Miss, would you like to bring the food over to share with your brother?"

"Brother?" Gwen looked at Cody, then Toby, puzzled. "I want to eat with my brother, but not here! This big brother doesn't like me!" she pouted, pointing at Toby.

"Little Miss, he's your brother too! You were too young to remember, but he's your older brother, Toby!" explained the staff member, her smile a bit forced.

Everyone knew that Gwen and Cody were Isabella Peterson's biological kids, but Toby wasn't. It was no secret in the mansion. While Toby was still called young master, it was often just a formality. His personality didn’t endear him to the staff, who clearly favored the twins.

Gwen and Cody didn't notice, but Toby, sensitive as ever, picked up on it. He clenched his fists silently and walked away.

Gwen watched him leave, blinking in confusion. "Is he really our brother?"

"I don't have a brother who bullies his sister," Cody said coldly, turning away to find another spot in the dining room. He didn't want to sit where Toby had been.

Gwen quickly followed her brother, the sight of delicious food soon wiping away her earlier discomfort. She clambered onto a chair without waiting for help and started stuffing her face with the tasty treats, completely absorbed in her little feast.

Toby's delicate situation was well-known, so the staff wisely chose not to comment. The breakfast incident quickly passed, fading from memory. Gwen, carefree as ever, forgot about it soon enough. But Cody remained unconvinced about Toby's claim to the title of "brother."

Toby, on the other hand, found the twins' air of entitlement annoying. Their first meeting had already sown seeds of discord among the three kids.

After breakfast, Gwen eagerly dragged Cody around the castle grounds. The two little adventurers explored all day, returning exhausted just in time for dinner.

As they entered the dining room, Gwen spotted Olivia Stewart and dashed over, exclaiming, "Mom! You're finally up! You missed so many amazing places today!"

Olivia hugged Gwen, affectionately patting her back. "Look at you, all sweaty! Go freshen up, sweetie!"

"I'm so hungry! Don't let anyone eat all the good stuff!" Gwen playfully peeked at the table as she tugged Cody towards the washroom, her antics drawing smiles from everyone.

Isabella Peterson chuckled, "That little rascal is getting more adorable by the day. She's like a little bundle of joy, isn't she, Olivia?"

Olivia smiled and cast a teasing glance at Isabella, noticing his loving gaze following the children out. "They say daughters are their fathers' past-life lovers. Seems true, huh?"

Isabella wrapped an arm around Olivia's waist, resting his chin on her shoulder with a playful smirk. "Jealous, are we?"

Olivia playfully pushed him away. "The kids will be back soon. Behave yourself!"

Reluctantly, Isabella draped his arm over the chair back, grumbling, "Teaching them about love from a young age isn't bad, right?"

"You're impossible..." Olivia was about to retort when Toby entered through the side door.

"Toby!"

Olivia stood up, her voice catching in surprise. He had grown so much in three years, now almost a young man. His face, still delicate, stirred complicated feelings in her heart.

She always felt a mix of guilt and affection toward Toby, emotions she couldn't fully articulate. "Aunt Olivia!" Toby greeted her with a bow, his manners impeccable.

Olivia's heart ached. 'Aunt,' he called her... After all these years, he still didn't have a proper family title. Calling her 'Mom' would mean calling Isabella 'Dad,' and that would be too much.

Olivia had hoped that with time, things would resolve themselves. But now she realized avoiding the problem hadn't solved anything. She decided to talk to Isabella about a solution after they had spent more time together as a family. Smiling, she asked Toby, "How have you been these past years?"

"I've been well, thank you, Aunt Olivia," Toby replied, his voice flat, devoid of the emotions typical for a nine-year-old.

Remembering how Toby once clung to her, Olivia felt a pang of loss at his cold demeanor. She sighed softly, "I'm sorry, Toby. I've been unwell these past years and couldn't take care of you. I hope you can understand and forgive me."

A flicker of emotion crossed Toby's face, but he said nothing, just nodded slightly. Not sure what else to say, Olivia simply gestured to the seat beside her. "Have a seat."

"Thank you, Aunt Olivia." Toby sat down formally.

Olivia, unaware of how Isabella and Toby had been getting along, glanced at Isabella, planning to ask him later.

"I'm back!" Gwen's voice rang out as she peeked in, playfully shaking water off her hands.

Cody followed, keeping a vigilant eye on Gwen's energetic antics. He worried she'd hurt herself around the glass walls.

Gwen made a beeline for Olivia, ready to sit down, but paused, seeing Toby had taken her usual spot. Her lip quivered as she asked, "Mom, where's my seat?"

Olivia pointed to the chair beside Toby, urging the staff to pull it out for Gwen. "Sit next to your brother, okay?"

Gwen stomped her foot. "I don't want to!"

Olivia's face hardened. "Gwen, be a good girl."

Unaware of the breakfast incident, Olivia thought Gwen was just being difficult. Tears welled up in Gwen's eyes as she cried, "I always sit next to you! You don't love me anymore!"

Gwen's tears turned to stubbornness as she insisted on sitting by Olivia, not daring to mention Toby's dislike for her.

Olivia's patience wore thin. "Gwen!"

Gwen cried harder.

"Want to sit with Daddy?" Isabella offered, trying to coax her.

"No! No! No!" Gwen shook her head, determined.

Olivia turned away in frustration. "Spoiled! Let her be."

Under the table, Toby's fists clenched tight. He'd spent the past three years thinking Olivia was away for treatment, only to discover today that the twins had been with her all along.
