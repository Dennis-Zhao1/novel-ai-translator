**A Chance for Redemption**

Back in the day, when their family business was booming, all he cared about was money and connections. His eyes were so focused on the dollar signs that he scarcely noticed anything else. Meanwhile, I, Grace Martin, had learned to cook like a pro, but he barely tasted my meals. 

Ethan King imagined Grace Martin, a woman who once might have been from a well-off family, now busy in the kitchen trying her best to perfect a dish. Maybe she had burned herself countless times, but she never gave up, all in the hope of winning back a heart that had strayed far from hers.

Ah, love—such a bittersweet thing!

Ethan King looked at Grace Martin with a tinge of sympathy. "So, how did you end up here? Did he abandon you?" he asked, only to remember that she'd mentioned her husband worked at the ranch too.

Grace Martin's face, though lined with age, glowed with a hint of youthful shyness. "Our family went through some troubles. We lost everything. But my husband finally realized what was important, and we started rebuilding our lives together. After a serious illness, I came to understand many things. Now we're working odd jobs while searching for our daughter."

Grace Martin glanced at Ethan King, careful not to reveal too much, knowing that he was the one who had taken Olivia Stewart under his wing for recovery.

Ethan King nodded, "Alright, you can cook in the kitchen."

"Sir!" Mrs. Lee, the housekeeper, cried out in surprise. "You're letting her cook?"

"Yes," Ethan King replied with a calm look at Grace Martin. "You said you could make all kinds of nutritious soups, right? Make one for me tomorrow."

If the taste was good, it would be perfect for Olivia Stewart. Ethan King gave his orders and left.

Grace Martin bowed thankfully, "Thank you, sir! Thank you!"

"Hmph!" Mrs. Lee huffed, slamming a bunch of scallions into a basket before storming off. She was already displeased with having a clumsy helper in the kitchen, and now, the woman had spun a tale and become the main cook!

The next day, Grace Martin carefully prepared a pot of soup and served it to Ethan King. He took a sip and nodded, "Hmm, not bad! Is there any left? Bring another pot; I'll take it to Olivia Stewart!"

Grace Martin was thrilled at the thought of Olivia Stewart drinking her soup, but then hesitated. "Sir!" she began awkwardly, "Could I make a fresh pot for Olivia Stewart?"

Ethan King set down his spoon, frowning slightly. "Hmm?"

Grace Martin quickly explained, "Oh, there's nothing wrong with this soup, sir. It's just... this is a tonic for boosting energy and kidney health, not really suitable for young women. Of course, I know you're young and don't need it, but I thought a little boost couldn't hurt, so..."

Ethan King's handsome face turned dark instantly. Without a girlfriend, drinking such a tonic every day—was she trying to ruin him?

Seeing Grace Martin standing there, head lowered and trembling, Ethan King waved her off. "You can go now!"

Grace Martin pleaded, "Please, sir, let me make another soup for Olivia Stewart. Something for beauty and health, perfect for a young girl!"

Ethan King, thinking she just wanted to secure her job, didn't overthink it. "Alright, go make a beauty and health soup, and let me taste it first!"

Grace Martin left, ecstatic and grateful.

That evening, a fresh pot of beauty and health soup was served to Ethan King. Grace Martin watched as he took a sip, a fleeting look of disappointment crossing her face. She had put her heart into making this for Olivia Stewart, but now the delicious soup was going to him instead.

Grace Martin glanced at the pot, grumbling internally: "A grown man drinking beauty soup? He's already handsome enough!"

As she mused, Ethan King finished half a bowl, savoring each spoonful. "Hmm, sweet but not greasy, fragrant... Olivia Stewart should like this!"

When he finished speaking, Grace Martin eagerly stepped forward. "Shall I take it to Olivia Stewart?"

"Hold on!" Ethan King stopped her, eyeing her suspiciously. "What's the rush?"

Grace Martin quickly retracted her hand. "No-no rush!"

In truth, she just wanted to see Olivia Stewart, even if it was from a distance. A glimpse would be enough.

"Cover it with a lid! You can go now," Ethan King ordered, eyeing her with suspicion.

Grace Martin left, disappointed, her head bowed.

Watching her leave, Ethan King pondered. Her eagerness made him wary. Concerned for Olivia Stewart's safety, he called the head of the household. "Investigate the new kitchen helper and her husband thoroughly."

Though it seemed excessive, the woman's behavior made him suspicious. With Olivia Stewart's well-being at stake, caution was necessary.

Soon, the butler reported back: the new worker, whom they called White, along with his wife, had stories that matched theirs.

After waiting a bit to ensure no adverse reaction to the soup, Ethan King took it to Olivia Stewart.

Olivia Stewart enjoyed the soup, dispelling Ethan King's doubts. He assigned Grace Martin to make soups for Olivia Stewart regularly.

Even though Grace Martin was now the main cook, Mrs. Lee couldn't hide her jealousy and kept a close watch, hoping to catch her slip up.

A week later, Mrs. Lee finally found something. Grace Martin, responsible only for soups, often snuck away after completing her tasks. Mrs. Lee followed her a few times and noticed she always went to the fence by the ranch, standing there for a long time.

The small pasture was a private space for Olivia Stewart's recovery, off-limits without permission. Grace Martin seemed eager to enter several times.

Mrs. Lee, feeling like she'd discovered a secret, hurried to report to Ethan King. Though she lacked concrete evidence, Grace Martin's sneaky behavior was suspicious enough.

So, when Grace Martin sneaked over again, Ethan King confronted her.

"Sir!" Grace Martin stammered, pulling back her foot from the fence as she saw Ethan King.

"I remember the new workers were warned not to enter this pasture. You knew that, right?"

Grace Martin, knowing she was wrong, whispered, "Yes."

Ethan King glared at her. "Then tell me, why were you sneaking in?"

Grace Martin lowered her head further. "I... I just thought the grass looked so soft and wanted to... step on it."

"Are you kidding me?"

Ethan King's usually charming face turned cold and intimidating.

"I... I..." Grace Martin couldn't meet his gaze, trying to make herself as small as possible.

"You want to get close to Olivia Stewart!" Ethan King pointed out bluntly.

Grace Martin looked up in shock, meeting Ethan King's eyes.

Caught.

Ethan King's expression turned fierce. "What are you plotting? Olivia Stewart's already in this state, hiding away here with animals, and you still want to harm her?"

"No, no, no!" Grace Martin backed away, falling to the ground.

"We... we came to atone! I just want to see her, not hurt her! And... I inherited a large sum after our bankruptcy. I want to use it for her treatment."

"White family? Which White family? From Golden City?" Ethan King pressed closer, his voice sharp.

Grace Martin nodded fearfully.

"White Jin-Song?"

Though phrased as a question, Ethan King spoke with certainty. He didn't know the couple personally, but their names were etched in his memory.

Because Olivia Stewart's current condition was partly their doing.

Hearing the anger in Ethan King's voice, Grace Martin's knees buckled, and she knelt down.

"Mr. King, please believe me. We truly want to make amends. Even if it means being the lowest servants, we want to stay by Olivia Stewart's side and see her recover. The money is for her treatment. It's with my husband; you can verify it! Please, give us a chance to atone! Don't send us away!"

Grace Martin's plea was sincere, her voice choked with emotion.

Ethan King, however, remained skeptical and immediately had Grace Martin and her husband detained in a small house far from Olivia Stewart under strict supervision.

He called Isabella Peterson, realizing only after the call went through that it was the middle of the night there. The phone barely rang once before Isabella Peterson answered, "What's going on?"

Even through the phone, Ethan King could sense Isabella Peterson's tension. Anything concerning Olivia Stewart made him anxious too.

Ethan King explained the situation with the White couple.

"They really went after Olivia Stewart?" Isabella Peterson sounded surprised.

"What did they do? Did they trouble Olivia Stewart? Under no circumstances should Olivia Stewart see them. If she's upset, the consequences could be disastrous!"

Isabella Peterson's voice was filled with worry. The thought of such parents existing made him furious.
