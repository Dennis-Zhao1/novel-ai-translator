Isabella Peterson grabbed the back of Tommy's collar, "What are you up to?"

Tommy didn't answer, just twisted away, kicking and biting in his attempt to escape. Isabella, with her usual finesse, found herself at a loss. Wrestling a kid was hardly a fair fight, and she was equally reluctant to let him win or lose. In the scramble, Tommy managed to slip from her grasp, darting away like a little monkey.

Seeing Tommy wriggle free, the two guards at the door instinctively moved to catch him, but Isabella stopped them. "Let him go! I'm curious to see what this little rascal is up to!"

The guards, taking Isabella's cue, simply followed Tommy without trying to restrain him. Tommy, noticing he was being chased, picked up speed, running in a frantic zig-zag pattern. Instead of heading out, he dashed straight toward the main castle, nearly falling into the fountain along the way.

"Ouch!"

Tommy smacked into the fountain's edge, a large bump forming on his forehead. But the pain didn't stop him. He scrambled up, hobbling onward, determined to reach the castle. The household staff, witnessing his wild dash, instinctively moved to block him, but Isabella’s firm gaze held them back.

Isabella, watching Tommy's headlong rush, had an inkling of what he might be up to. She waved the guards and staff away, quietly trailing behind him.

Sure enough, Tommy burst into the main hall and bolted upstairs, heading straight for Olivia Stewart’s room. He pushed the door open with some effort.

The bed was a pile of blankets, hiding any sign of life. Tommy hesitated at the doorway, then tiptoed over, his small hand trembling as he pulled back a corner of the covers.

Olivia Stewart lay curled beneath the blankets, her wide, vacant eyes staring up at him. Seeing Tommy's boyish face appear, Olivia flinched, her eyes filled with fear.

Fear!

Tommy had never seen Olivia like this before. Terrified, he dropped the blanket and stepped back, bumping into Isabella’s leg with a thud.

He looked up, finding Isabella’s stern face above him, and shivered. His lips moved, but no sound came out.

"You want to know why Olivia Stewart is like this, don't you?" Isabella asked, her voice sharp.

Though she didn't want to speak so harshly to a child, this kid was really testing her patience.

Tommy nodded, fear mingling with a stubborn bravery as he met Isabella's gaze.

"Follow me!" Isabella commanded coldly, walking away.

Tommy trailed behind her, step by step.

In the hallway, Isabella stopped, turning to look down at Tommy, her words deliberate and cutting, "It’s because you let her down completely!"

Tommy’s expression turned puzzled, and Isabella continued, her voice icy, "You know Olivia Stewart is your mom, right? She's been trying to find the right moment to tell you, but never wanted to hurt your little heart."

"Hah! Did it hurt your little heart? Your heart's colder than anyone's! Otherwise, how could you hurt Olivia Stewart like this?"

"If you're mad because she didn't raise you, let me tell you, when you were born, she was sick. You were taken and sold by her adoptive father!"

"She didn’t abandon you. She’s been carrying the guilt of your difficult childhood! She’s been trying to make it up to you, even at the expense of ignoring the twins!"

"Are you jealous of the twins because they're luckier than you? Is that why you act out, throwing tantrums whenever Olivia Stewart is with them? Have you thought about the fact that they're her kids too, and they need her just as much as you do?"

"You’re just a selfish little brat! Deep down, you understand everything, but you choose to act like a rebellious child, making Olivia Stewart exhaust herself over you!"

Hearing Isabella’s words, Tommy’s eyelashes quivered violently. She had hit his deepest, darkest secret.

Isabella, seeing his reaction, felt her anger rise. Her fists clenched so tightly she could feel the veins throbbing, her voice a low growl, "When you tried to throw Emily into the water, did you think about how Olivia Stewart would feel? You’re both her kids, she loves you both. What do you expect her to do?"

Tommy’s eyes widened in shock, stumbling back a few steps. At the time, he just thought Emily was stealing his attention, and he wanted to get rid of her. He never imagined it would turn out like this!

He truly hadn’t thought it through!

Isabella felt like she was wasting her breath, arguing with a kid. Why was she even bothering?

From the moment Tommy returned, he had turned their lives upside down!

"Bam!"

Isabella punched the wall next to Tommy, making him flinch and close his eyes.

"Because of Olivia Stewart, I won’t do anything to you. Keep pretending to be a problem child if you wish!" Isabella said coldly, striding away.

Tommy stood there, stunned, for what felt like forever...

He wasn’t a bad kid, really. He just had a knot in his heart that needed untangling, and no one had guided him properly. Olivia Stewart, feeling guilty, often indulged him rather than educating him. Isabella’s words were like a wake-up call, shaking his young heart deeply.

The hallway was silent. The staff stayed away, not daring to intervene in such a sensitive family matter. They feared becoming collateral damage in this household drama.

Tommy stood stiffly against the wall, his delicate features serious, as if pondering a great mystery.

After half an hour, he finally moved, heading back to Olivia Stewart’s room. His legs, numb from standing, gave way, and he tumbled to the floor.

Struggling to his feet, he limped into the room.

Olivia sat on the bed, no longer hiding under the covers, lost in thought.

Tommy approached, then dropped to his knees before her.

"Aunt Olivia, I’m sorry! I was wrong!" he cried.

But Olivia didn’t react, not even blinking, as if she hadn’t seen or heard him.

"Aunt Olivia, I really know I was wrong! I won’t do it again. Please forgive me?" Tommy wept harder.

Before, she always coaxed him to speak when he was silent. Now that he was finally speaking, she ignored him!

The thought of being abandoned by her forever unleashed a flood of sorrow, and his tears fell like rain.

He crawled forward on his knees, wrapping his arms around Olivia’s legs, looking up at her with a pleading gaze, "Aunt Olivia..."

The sight of his innocent face made Olivia flinch. She pulled away and quickly climbed into bed, cocooning herself in the blankets.

Tommy watched, his tear-streaked face crumpling with grief.

His beloved Aunt Olivia was scared of him!

All because he, in a moment of jealousy, had tried to hurt his own sister!

"Get out! Stop bothering her!" Isabella barked, entering the room. Seeing Tommy scare Olivia back into hiding, she grabbed him by the collar and tossed him out.

Tommy, surprisingly, didn’t run away like usual. Instead, he went to the kitchen, hoping to help and learn how to make something for Olivia.

Though the staff had always been cautious around him due to his unpredictable nature, his tearful face now tugged at their hearts.

Mrs. Wang, the cook, softened and agreed to help him.

The Peterson family’s meals were always exquisite, prepared by a top chef with flavors from around the world.

Mrs. Wang didn’t dare let Tommy actually cook for Olivia, so she took him to a small backup kitchen, showing him how to make a simple fish and carrot soup.

To prevent any mishaps, she kept a close eye on him.

But Tommy was focused the entire time, though clumsy, nearly tipping the pot several times.

Seeing his blistered hands, Mrs. Wang’s heart ached, "Let me help you, young master."

Tommy shook his head, "Aunt Olivia dislikes me now. I want to make a soup she likes with my own hands!"

Mrs. Wang couldn’t bear to shatter his hopeful illusion by telling him Olivia might never taste it.

After much effort, Tommy finally finished the soup with Mrs. Wang’s help, just in time for dinner.

Mrs. Wang helped him strain it, pouring the creamy broth into a beautiful blue porcelain bowl, garnished with bright green scallions, both delicious and visually appealing.
