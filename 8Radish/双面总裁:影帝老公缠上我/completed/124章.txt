The stunt was too amateurish.

Tian Yi's piercing blue eyes glanced at Olivia Stewart as he scooped her up in his arms, striding out of the set with everyone watching.

"Amy Green, drive us to the hospital!"

"On it, on it!"

Amy Green, ever the eager assistant, dashed off like lightning.

Director Wang was left flabbergasted by this sudden turn of events. It wasn't until Tian Yi had carried Olivia Stewart out of sight that he yelled, "Who the heck poured hot water in the tea cup? Who did it?"

Everyone turned their eyes toward Sophie Cook, who was still on the ground. Their faces showed little sympathy—more like a mischievous delight at the drama unfolding. They started gossiping, "Sisters fighting dirty? This is like a modern soap opera!"

"To think she'd go after her own sister. How bad must Olivia Stewart's reputation be?"

Director Wang, frustrated, grabbed a megaphone and shouted, "Everyone shut up! Where are the crew members? Are you all just standing there? Help her up, for crying out loud!"

A crew member hurried over, removing the chair from Sophie Cook's head. With support, she shakily got to her feet.

Before she could steady herself, Director Wang was in her face, eyes bulging like a goldfish, looking furious. "You better have a good explanation for this!"

Sophie Cook, feeling faint and nursing a throbbing headache from the chair collision, couldn't help but cry. It was meant to be a sympathy ploy, but the pain was genuine.

"I'm the director, stop pretending!"

Sophie Cook was speechless, tears rolling down her cheeks.

She wanted to play the sympathy card, but the pain was real.

"Tell me, was it you who poured the hot water?"

Director Wang wasn't fooled. The prop tea was always cold; it had to be this reckless woman, switching it out for her own purposes!

"I didn't do it."

"Still lying?"

"I'm telling the truth! Maybe someone poured it earlier and it hadn't cooled yet. I didn't know; otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten burned!"

To prove her innocence, Sophie Cook showed her hands—red and blistered.

"When serving the tea, I noticed the cup was too hot. I was about to warn my sister, but I couldn't hold it, and it spilled. I'm sorry to her, but it was an accident!"

Sophie hung her head low, looking remorseful.

Director Wang, seeing her pitiful state, was at a loss for what to do. He waved her off, "Go rest up! All departments, skip their scene and move on to the next one!"

The crew dispersed quickly, getting back to their tasks. Sophie Cook limped to a chair at the edge of the set, feeling utterly defeated.

"Such childish tricks, and you're not even embarrassed?"

"You..."

Sophie Cook looked up to see Lisa, smiling sweetly and acting concerned.

To an outsider, it would seem like Lisa was genuinely worried for Sophie Cook!

Sophie clenched her fists in frustration.

They were all newbies, so why did Olivia Stewart get all the attention from the leading man, while she was left to face scorn and bullying?

With a cold smile, Sophie retorted, "Lisa, don't think I don't know you despise Olivia Stewart. If you're so capable, why not use some smarter tactics?"

"Oh, trying to provoke me into doing your dirty work? Nice try! Sure, I dislike Olivia, but at least I use my brain. Just wait, no matter how much she jumps around, I'll always be the top star in this industry!"

As two young actors walked by, Lisa quickly switched to a friendly demeanor, checking the time. "Oh, I have to get to my next scene!"

With a big-sisterly pat on Sophie's shoulder, Lisa sauntered off.

What a phony!

Sophie simmered with anger but had no outlet, so she sat back down sulkily.

The two young actors passing by whispered to each other.

"Sophie Cook is so ungrateful. She caused such a mess, and even Lisa didn't hold it against her. Yet she still plays the diva!"

"Olivia Stewart's burn was definitely her doing! To burn someone else, she even hurt herself. That's terrifying. We should steer clear of her!"

"She's just dumb! Look at Olivia Stewart—so clearly favored. With him backing her, what's the point of being jealous? It would be smarter to butter up to her and maybe gain some benefits. If I had a sister like that, I'd cling to her, not push her away like Sophie!"

Their voices faded as they walked away, but the words lingered in Sophie's mind, slowly cooling her anger. The girl had a point. Maybe it was time for a change in strategy.

A sinister smile crept across Sophie Cook's face, like a snake lying dormant, waiting to strike.

Meanwhile, Olivia Stewart's dramatic trip to the hospital with Tian Yi caused quite the stir. Dressed in their costumes, the hospital staff was more interested in snapping photos and getting autographs than treating her burn.

Tian Yi's icy command cut through the chaos, "Everyone except the burn specialist, out!"

Amy Green stepped in, charming the nurses with a winning smile, "Ladies, please, healing comes first. Once we're done, our star will sign autographs for everyone. But for now, no photos, please. We'll have you sign non-disclosure agreements, and any unauthorized photos will void the autograph offer. Plus, we'll take legal action for any invasion of privacy."

Her deft handling diffused the situation quickly.

An older doctor examined Olivia's leg and sighed with relief. The rush made him expect something serious, but it was just a bit red.

"It's just a little redness, nothing major. Some ointment will do," he said, removing his glasses.

"Are you sure? It's quite red," Tian Yi's voice was cold, like it had been dipped in ice water.

The doctor, unfazed, replied with a shrug, "If you're concerned, feel free to visit a larger hospital."

Tian Yi clenched his fists. He, a man of status, was not used to being dismissed.

Olivia quickly intervened, whispering to Tian Yi, "Don't be upset. I'm really okay! You're a public figure, you have to maintain your image. Don't let this bother you..."

Tian Yi's gaze lingered on Olivia's leg. He didn't care much about his public image, but he couldn't let Olivia's injury go untreated. If not for keeping a low profile, he would have taken her to a private clinic immediately.

For Olivia, he swallowed his pride. "Prescribe the medication."

The doctor scribbled down the prescription without further fuss.

Tian Yi handed the prescription to Amy Green and carried Olivia to a VIP room for some rest. Along the way, they were the center of attention, with Olivia feeling increasingly self-conscious.

"Tian Yi, you can put me down. I really can walk," she whispered, tugging at his sleeve.

He ignored her, quickening his pace.

In the VIP room, Tian Yi kicked the door shut, blocking out the curious onlookers and leaving a peaceful quiet behind.

Olivia tried to get down, but he stopped her. "Don't move!"

His voice was firm, leaving no room for argument.

She froze, realizing that behind his gentle exterior, Tian Yi was as domineering as Isabella Peterson. If not for their obvious differences, she might have thought they were the same.

Tian Yi gently placed Olivia on the couch, elevating her injured leg on the armrest.

The intimate gesture made Olivia uncomfortable, especially being alone in the room with him. The tension was palpable.

"So, um..." Olivia broke the silence, "It's really not a big deal. We didn't need a private room."

Private room...

Realizing the implication, she quickly added, "Uh, I mean, not a hospital room."

"Oh, so you want a hotel room instead?"
