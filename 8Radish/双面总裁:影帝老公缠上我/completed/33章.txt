Title: The Unexpected Encounter

"How on earth are we supposed to find someone in a city this big?" Olivia Stewart overheard a couple of women gossiping as she sipped her coffee in the bustling café.

"Well, it's not all bad news," the other woman replied. "Rumor has it that Mrs. Peterson ordered all the hospitals to offer free check-ups for pregnant women. Group Peterson is footing the bill for everything."

"They just want DNA samples to find the woman who's carrying the Peterson heir. Ever since their announcement, loads of pregnant women have come forward, hoping to claim the prize. I heard the woman might be in disguise, so Mrs. Peterson wants her son to identify her personally. That's why they're putting them all up in hotels around the city. But I bet half of them are fakes."

"Fakes?"

"Yeah, they're just there to catch the eye of Isabella Peterson's son, pretending to be pregnant to get a foot in the door with the real estate tycoon family. Who wouldn’t want to marry into that kind of wealth?"

Olivia couldn't help but feel a twinge of surprise. She knew Isabella was wealthy, but she hadn't realized just how powerful his family was. The gap between their worlds was like the Grand Canyon.

But why should his status matter to her anyway? Olivia shook her head, pushing the thought aside. She continued to eavesdrop, intrigued by the unfolding drama.

"So, Mrs. Peterson is clueless about the fake pregnancies?"

"She didn't know at first. They're investigating now, and a few have already been thrown out. But those women have a certain charm, and Mrs. Peterson might keep some around for her son."

Olivia felt a headache coming on. All she did was pretend to be pregnant once, and now she might have inadvertently helped Isabella create a harem! If this madness continued until the truth came out, she couldn't imagine the mess she'd be in.

She realized she might have to go back to Isabella for help. The things he held over her were piling up.

Meanwhile, Isabella Peterson's sports car was parked in front of the gym, half an hour early. He was waiting patiently.

As time passed without any sign of Olivia, Isabella's assistant, Amy Green, got bored and sidled up to him. "Boss, want me to give you a makeover? Maybe try to impress her?"

Isabella looked uncomfortable but eventually grunted in agreement. "Fine."

"On it, boss!" Amy, a master of disguise, pulled out his toolkit. Isabella, a public figure often in the spotlight, effortlessly blended into normal life thanks to Amy's skills.

"I didn't bring much today, just a bit of touch-up."

Isabella closed his eyes, letting Amy do his thing. "It's hot, don't pile on the stuff."

"Got it, boss!"

Meanwhile, Olivia was racing against the clock. She was late, and her oversized clothes didn't help. Sweaty and uncomfortable, she dashed across the plaza, nearly at the gym entrance when she collided with someone.

"Sorry, sorry!" Olivia muttered, clutching her head and trying to move around the obstacle. She had five minutes to get to work, and she couldn't afford to waste time.

"Olivia Stewart?" a sharp, incredulous voice called out.

Olivia paused and looked up, seeing Emily Young’s round face. Next to her was Daniel Johnson.

Great. Just her luck to run into these two.

Olivia's expression turned icy, and she tried to walk away.

"Olivia Stewart!" Daniel called, only to be yanked back by Emily.

"You never call me like that," Emily scolded.

"Easy, honey. We need her," Daniel winced.

Emily pointed at Olivia's retreating form. "Think she's hooked up with a celebrity?"

"Could be. And don't you want her boyfriend to model for your store?"

"Right, let's catch her!"

Olivia had just made it into the gym lobby when Daniel caught up with her, breathless.

"Olivia, wait, I need to talk to you!"

She didn't want to deal with him, but he blocked her path.

The lobby bustled with people, some casting curious glances their way.

Olivia checked the time. Even if she sprinted, she’d still be late. Resigned to her fate, she turned to Daniel, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "What do you want? Did Emily beat you up again, or did she cheat on you?"

Daniel flushed, but quickly recovered, plastering on a sycophantic smile. "Olivia, I need a favor. Remember our past together…"

"Stop right there! Don't bring that up; it's gross. Get to the point or get lost, or I'll have security throw you out."

"Please, Olivia, don't!"

Seeing her anger, Daniel finally got to the point. "You've snagged a celebrity boyfriend, huh? I can help you with the publicity."

"What are you talking about, Daniel? Did Emily hit you too hard?"

"Don't play dumb. I saw that big-shot guy carrying you home. I even snapped a photo."

Realization dawned on Olivia. Daniel must have photographed Isabella carrying her when she was drunk.

Daniel, sensing a change in her, smirked, his tone turning sly and threatening.

"Olivia, who knew you had it in you to catch someone like that? But if your new boyfriend sees this, he might not be pleased. Give me more photos of you two, and I won’t tell. I’ll even blur your face, so no one knows it's you. We both win."

"Smack!" Olivia’s hand met Daniel’s cheek with a loud slap.

Daniel stared at her in disbelief, holding his reddening face. She had grown bold in the past months.

"Olivia, stop!"

Emily barreled over, her large frame wobbling toward them.

She glared at Olivia, her eyes like daggers. "You hit my husband, you witch!"

Daniel quickly held her back. "Focus, focus on the plan!"

"What plan? She hit you, and you want me to let it slide?"

Emily turned on Olivia. "Give us those photos, or we’ll tell your boyfriend!"

"What are you going to tell him?" a voice interrupted.

Emily and Daniel froze, turning toward the entrance.
