Olivia Stewart Became the Good Girl

"Okay!"

Isabella Peterson gently guided Olivia Stewart to a nearby chair and helped her sit down. "Olivia, can you sit here by yourself for a bit?" she asked.

Olivia didn't respond.

As Isabella released her hand and began to turn away, she felt Olivia's fingers hold onto hers for a brief moment.

"Olivia!" Isabella exclaimed excitedly. "Do you not like this place? Do you want me to stay with you?"

Olivia slowly lowered her arm, her expression unchanged.

Isabella turned to the doctor with a childlike excitement. "She just squeezed my hand!"

The specialist smiled, "That shows there's self-awareness inside Olivia. She just doesn't want to come out into the world yet. This environment doesn't make her feel safe, so she clings to you, which is a good sign! If we can find the root of the problem, she might recover soon."

Isabella felt encouraged by the specialist's words. "What tests should we run? Let's start right away!"

The specialist began a targeted conversation with Olivia, based on her past experiences.

Two hours passed. The specialist was parched from talking, but Olivia remained unresponsive, living in her own world, just as he had suspected.

When the questioning ended, Isabella had been waiting anxiously by Olivia's side. She only relaxed when the specialist removed his glasses and announced the session was over.

"How did it go?" Isabella asked eagerly.

The specialist looked at Olivia, who sat quietly in her small chair.

"It's hard to say for sure yet. But one thing is clear: Olivia does respond to external stimuli. She hasn't completely shut herself off. It's just that she subconsciously doesn't want to come out. If we can find a place she likes and a person she trusts to be with her, she might open up when she's ready."

"Am I that person?" Isabella asked, her voice filled with urgency.

If she could be trusted, she'd set everything aside—work, responsibilities—and take Olivia wherever she wished, doing whatever she wanted.

The specialist gathered his notes and pointed to the advanced cameras around Olivia. "I need to analyze her micro-expressions, and this process takes time. You can take Olivia home for now. I'll inform you as soon as I have results."

"Alright, don't rush it. Accuracy is key!" Isabella instructed.

Though she was eager for immediate answers, she was willing to wait for the best solution to provide Olivia a sense of security.

Leaving the consultation room, Isabella took Olivia to a fancy restaurant and ordered all her favorite dishes.

"Olivia, do you remember the shrimp feast you had? When you ate shrimp with that annoying guy, it drove me nuts. So, I got you a whole table of shrimp!" Isabella said, peeling shrimp for Olivia while wearing disposable gloves.

Olivia ate quietly, her expression unchanged, but her eyelashes fluttered when Isabella mentioned the guy.

Unfortunately, Isabella was too focused on peeling shrimp to notice.

It's been ages since Olivia last saw Ethan King after Isabella orchestrated a grand apology and proposal filled with red roses. Ethan left with a simple "I wish you happiness" and disappeared into the background.

Isabella placed peeled shrimp into Olivia's bowl, watching her enjoy the food with a slight smile.

After cleaning her hands meticulously, Isabella wiped Olivia's mouth, her gaze lingering on Olivia's cherry-red lips.

So tempting. It made Isabella want to steal a kiss.

But as she leaned in, Olivia remained unfazed, her expression unchanged.

With a sigh, Isabella pulled back, admitting defeat. "Forget it. I won't take advantage of you. I don't want you to remember this and think I bullied you once you're back to normal."

Given Olivia's current state of withdrawal, her willingness to be with Isabella and listen was already a significant achievement. The last thing Isabella wanted was to scare Olivia away.

After their sumptuous meal, Isabella took Olivia back home to their estate.

The afternoon sun was bright, and once they were inside the main grounds, Isabella sent the driver away and strolled with Olivia along a fragrant, flower-lined path.

"Hello, Miss Olivia!" greeted the staff and bodyguards passing by.

Isabella nodded coolly, while Olivia walked on, lost in her thoughts.

Though her face showed little emotion, Isabella could tell Olivia enjoyed this leisurely walk.

They continued toward the main castle.

During the walk, Isabella received an urgent call and stopped to talk for a few minutes. When she looked up, Olivia was gone.

Panic surged through her. "Olivia!" she called out.

A servant rushed over. "Miss Olivia was heading towards the conservatory!"

Isabella hurried in that direction.

Sure enough, Olivia stood in front of the glass greenhouse.

The conservatory had been built when they discovered Olivia's love for clay sculpting.

Memories of them sculpting together were still fresh, but life had gotten in the way, and Isabella hadn't brought Olivia back since.

Guilt washed over Isabella like a tidal wave.

She hurried forward and opened the glass door. "Olivia, want to play with clay? Come in! Look, I collected various types of clay from around the world for you. Do you remember?"

Olivia's eyes flickered, and she looked at the piles of clay before stepping inside.

Isabella watched her, thrilled, following closely behind.

At one of the sculpting tables, Olivia touched a clay-filled container.

"Want to try?" Isabella asked, excited. "I'll play with you!"

Without hesitation, Isabella opened the container and handed Olivia a lump of clay.

"Here! You loved sculpting. Make whatever you want!"

Olivia held the clay, her expression blank, obviously unsure of what to do or how to start.

Realizing this, Isabella quickly called Lucas Wright. "Bring the clay sculptures from the living room display. Hurry!"

Lucas soon arrived, breathless, carrying a box. "Here it is, Miss!"

Isabella took the box eagerly. "Thanks, Lucas."

Back at Olivia's side, Isabella opened the box like a kid showing off a treasure. "Olivia, look! These are the sculptures we made together—a happy family. This one's me, this one's you, and these are the twins. Remember? Sometimes I think you knew you'd have twins, and one of each, no less! But hey, I guess I had something to do with that too..."

As Isabella rambled about their sweet past, Olivia's gaze fell on the clay figures, a spark of curiosity in her dark eyes.

She dropped the clay she was holding, picked up one of the small figures, and studied it, a faint smile appearing on her lips.

It was a slight smile, but a smile nonetheless.
