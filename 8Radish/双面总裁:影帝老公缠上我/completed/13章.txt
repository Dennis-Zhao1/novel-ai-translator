**A Twisted Breakfast**

Isabella Peterson stared at Olivia Stewart for what felt like an eternity, his face a canvas of complex emotions. His dark eyes seemed like an endless pool, swirling with hidden depths.

Olivia knew she might have ticked Isabella off, so she kept her head down, avoiding eye contact like a kid who got caught sneaking cookies before dinner.

Silence stretched between them until an awkward growl from Olivia's stomach broke the tension. Finally, Isabella spoke, "Let's go eat."

Holding Olivia's hand, Isabella led her down the hallway. Olivia didn't resist, instead walking beside him, all cooperative and sweet.

Isabella's mood lightened instantly.

"Good morning, Mr. Peterson!"

"Good morning, Ms. Stewart!"

Servants greeted them respectfully as they passed, and Olivia wisely chose not to correct their formalities.

When they reached the dining room, Olivia's eyes widened in amazement. The giant, rotating restaurant was surrounded by transparent glass walls, angled perfectly to let in sunlight, casting rainbow reflections that felt like a dream. Exotic flowers bloomed in a greenhouse around the room, forming a vibrant floral ring. Olivia couldn't take it all in; her eyes didn't seem enough.

Isabella gently turned Olivia's head to face him. "What are you doing?"

"Looking at you."

"You don't have flowers on your face."

"I'm better looking than flowers."

Such arrogance! Olivia shook off Isabella's hand and skipped ahead. A servant swiftly opened a glass door for her, and she stepped inside, where a colorful fish swam under her feet. Startled, she pulled back, afraid of stepping on it.

"Goofball," Isabella teased from above, his voice a mix of amusement and affection.

Olivia looked down and realized there was a sturdy glass floor beneath her. Underneath, clear blue water shimmered, with all sorts of whimsical fish swimming around.

"Wow! This is amazing! Isabella, you're so creative!"

Isabella beamed at her compliment, like a kid getting candy. "You love romantic, unique things, right?" He wrapped an arm around Olivia's waist, gently leading her further in.

Olivia was too captivated by the scene beneath her to notice. She carefully stepped onto the glass floor, giggling as fish swam below. Mesmerized, she hopped around, laughing joyfully.

Isabella watched her with a tender smile, a warmth in his eyes that spoke volumes.

"Mr. Peterson, Ms. Stewart, breakfast is served!"

An elderly voice interrupted, full of respect.

Olivia stopped, realizing she had bounced her way to a sleek, crystal dining table. An older man in a navy butler's uniform pulled out a chair for her, bowing deeply.

Feeling awkward about an older gentleman serving her, Olivia hesitated.

Isabella stepped forward, seating Olivia with a frown, sending a chilly glance at the butler. "You disrupted my lady's fun. You're getting sloppy in your old age."

The butler bowed even lower, "Apologies, Mr. Peterson."

"Hey! Isabella, that's not fair!" Olivia stood, hands on her hips, cheeks puffed in defiance. "Don't bully the elderly! And I'm not your lady!"

Isabella's eyes narrowed dangerously. This girl was getting bold and needed some reining in.

"Say that again!"

"Don't bully the elderly!"

At least she didn't repeat the "not your lady" part.

Isabella's tense expression eased a fraction. He turned to the butler, asking, "Lucas Wright, did I bully you?"

"No, no, Mr. Peterson is always kind to us," Lucas replied, his wrinkled face breaking into a smile.

Olivia couldn't help but laugh at the sight, showing off her pearly whites. "Lucas Wright, huh? You really are like a cheerful Buddha, bringing joy wherever you go."

Lucas bowed again, "Thank you, Ms. Stewart."

Olivia quickly helped him up. "Lucas, you're not young anymore. Don't bow so much; it'll hurt your back."

Isabella swatted Olivia's hand away, eyes darkening with annoyance. "What? You interested in this old man now? Olivia, your taste is terrible."

"Isabella, ever heard of respecting your elders? Jealous of an old man? Are you serious?"

Isabella's face flushed slightly. "Who's jealous? Just eat!"

Following Isabella's command, servants lifted the transparent covers from the table, and the delicious aroma of breakfast filled the air, making mouths water.

"Wow, so much good food!"

As a self-proclaimed foodie, Olivia's eyes sparkled at the feast. She reached for the chopsticks but paused when a servant handed her a warm towel.

Oh, right, handwashing before eating. Germs, be gone!

A bit embarrassed, Olivia wiped her hands and returned the towel. Immediately, another towel was offered.

Wait, did I not clean them well enough?

Confused, Olivia glanced at Isabella, who sat across from her, letting a servant meticulously clean his hands, looking every bit the pampered prince.

Oh, right, his cleanliness obsession. Everything's done in threes.

True enough, after the second towel, a third dry one appeared.

Isabella lifted his head slightly, explaining, "First is disinfectant, second is clean water, third is…"

"Annoying!" Olivia mumbled, rolling her eyes. Rich people and their quirks!

Isabella's brow furrowed ever so slightly.

Finally gripping the chopsticks, Olivia sat upright, determined not to attract another towel.

Breakfast was lavish, with both Western and Asian dishes, artfully displayed on crystal plates, rotating like models on a runway.

Olivia eyed a plate of perfectly wrapped dumplings. Just as she reached for one, a servant deftly placed it on her plate.

Her chopsticks hung mid-air, feeling a tad redundant.

Another plate with golden balls caught her eye. Before she could even think of grabbing one, the servant quickly placed it before her.

This ability to read the room and swift actions made Olivia feel her hand was unnecessary. She looked at Isabella, who was also being waited on, with one servant serving and another dabbing his mouth, like he was some infirm patient.

Olivia lost her appetite and set her chopsticks down.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, "Hmm?"

"Too many people watching. It's awkward. I can't eat."

With a wave of his hand, Isabella dismissed the servants, leaving only Lucas Wright.

Olivia instantly felt more at ease. Turning to Lucas, she smiled, "Lucas, why don't you join us?"

Lucas seemed flustered, shaking his head, "Oh no, Ms. Stewart, that's against the rules."

He glanced at Isabella, whose face already looked stormy.

"I'll check on the dessert preparations," Lucas said quickly and left faster than a rabbit.

Olivia chuckled at his 'the sky is falling' expression. That old butler was just too adorable!

"Smack!"

Isabella slammed his chopsticks down, glaring at Olivia. "Everyone's gone. What are you looking at?"

This ungrateful woman, making him mad twice over an old man. He should fire that old guy!

Olivia turned back, confused, "What's your problem now?"

Isabella looked away awkwardly. "Just eat!"

Still peeved, he muttered, "All morning, you watched that old man. Even when he's gone, you still look. Am I not better looking?"

"Spit—cough, cough…"

Olivia had just popped a dumpling into her mouth and burst out laughing, choking on her own saliva, her face turning red.

Annoyed by the mess Olivia made, Isabella still got up swiftly, rounding the table to help her. Gently patting her back, he eased her into her chair, calming her breathing. But as he continued, his hand grew warmer, like a fire igniting within…
