Chapter 10: Secrets Beneath the Surface
Olivia Stewart found herself in what could only be described as a predicament of epic proportions. As the car glided silently through the night, her nerves felt as raw as an open wire. She tried to stay calm, sitting stiffly in the plush leather seat, her hands clenched tightly in her lap. But every now and then, her eyes flicked toward Isabella Peterson, who was seated across from her, radiating an air of effortless control.

The faint hum of the car engine was the only sound as the driver occasionally glanced at the two through the rearview mirror. Isabella, with his arms crossed and his posture relaxed, looked like he had all the time in the world. Olivia, on the other hand, felt like a bomb on the verge of going off. She sat as rigid as a board, her nerves jangling with every passing second.

How did I end up like this? she thought miserably. All I wanted was a quiet life. Now I’m wrapped up with this ice-cold CEO who’s got more secrets than the Vatican vault.

The silence stretched, thick and suffocating. Olivia’s eyelids began to grow heavy. Between the adrenaline crash from the earlier chaos and the soothing motion of the car, her body was finally giving out. She blinked once, twice, and then her head bobbed forward slightly before jerking back up. Isabella noticed her struggle but said nothing, a small smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.

A few more minutes passed, and Olivia lost the battle entirely. Her head lolled to the side, coming to rest awkwardly against the seat. A soft sigh escaped her lips as her body relaxed, completely unaware of her surroundings.

Isabella observed her for a moment, his sharp gaze softening imperceptibly. With a quiet sigh of his own, he reached out. His long arm slipped beneath her, and before she could stir, he pulled her into his lap. Olivia mumbled something unintelligible, but when his hand began to gently pat her back, she nuzzled closer, unconsciously seeking the warmth of his embrace.

The sight of her so vulnerable caught Isabella off guard. His hand, still resting on her back, hesitated for a moment. Then, as though deciding it was safe to linger, he continued his slow, rhythmic pats, his expression unreadable.

The driver cleared his throat softly. "Sir, should we head to the hotel or back to your residence?"

Isabella’s gaze remained fixed on the sleeping woman in his arms. For a brief moment, something flickered in his eyes—something unguarded, almost tender. But it vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

"Contact Michael Wright," Isabella said coolly. "Have him arrange for her to be taken to her current residence. I want to know exactly where she lives."

The driver nodded and made the call, his voice hushed as he relayed the orders. Meanwhile, Isabella’s thoughts churned beneath his calm exterior. His home was sacred, reserved for someone truly special. No one else had the right to step inside its walls. Not yet.

And until he confirmed who Olivia truly was, she wouldn’t either.

In the trailing security car, Ethan King was a bundle of nerves. Wedged between two hulking bodyguards, he had spent the last twenty minutes fuming. Every time he tried to reach for his phone to call Olivia, one of the guards would shoot him a warning glare.

"Let me make one call! Just one!" Ethan finally burst out.

The guards exchanged a glance before one of them slapped a strip of duct tape over Ethan's mouth.

Ethan flailed in protest, letting out a muffled string of curses that earned him nothing but a pair of raised eyebrows. Resigned to his fate, he sank back against the seat, his eyes glaring daggers at the guards.

Just then, the front passenger seat swiveled, revealing Michael Wright, Isabella’s trusted lieutenant. His signature smirk was firmly in place as he regarded Ethan with mild amusement.

"Boss wants to know where Olivia lives," Michael said, his tone casual. "Care to give directions?"

Ethan glared at him but quickly composed himself. He mumbled something unintelligible through the tape.

Michael tilted his head. "What was that? Speak up, buddy."

The tape was peeled back just enough for Ethan to bark, "Take the outer loop!"

Michael raised an eyebrow but shrugged. "Suit yourself."

The convoy followed Ethan's instructions, circling the highway aimlessly. It wasn’t until the third loop that Michael glanced at Ethan through the rearview mirror, his tone laced with mockery.

"We’ve been driving in circles for thirty minutes. If you don’t stop playing games, the boss might just decide to keep Olivia permanently."

Ethan’s smirk vanished. With a heavy sigh, he finally relented and gave them the correct directions.

Fifteen minutes later, the cars pulled into a modest residential area on West Street. Before the first car had even come to a full stop, Ethan was out, sprinting toward the Rolls-Royce at the front of the convoy. He yanked the door open, his voice tight with worry.

"Olivia—"

"Shh."

The soft yet commanding sound froze Ethan mid-sentence. Isabella’s sharp gaze met his, warning him to keep his voice down. Olivia was still curled up in Isabella’s arms, fast asleep.

Ethan’s eyes widened as he took in the sight. Olivia was draped in Isabella’s suit jacket, her bare legs peeking out beneath the hem of her dress. His heart twisted painfully.

"What did you do to her?" he hissed, his voice trembling with a mix of anger and jealousy.

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "She’s sleeping. Keep your voice down."

Ethan wasn’t satisfied with that answer. His hand shot out, grabbing the edge of the jacket and pulling it aside.

"Brr... cold."

The soft murmur from Olivia made both men freeze. She instinctively burrowed deeper into Isabella’s chest, seeking his warmth.

Ethan’s jaw clenched as he watched the scene unfold. The sight of Olivia so at ease with Isabella felt like a dagger to his chest.

"She deserves better than you," Ethan said through gritted teeth, his fists trembling at his sides.

Isabella didn’t respond. Instead, he adjusted the jacket around Olivia, his movements deliberate and precise. His silence only fueled Ethan’s frustration, but there was nothing he could do. Not here, not now.

"Lead the way," Isabella said finally, his tone leaving no room for argument.

With no choice but to comply, Ethan led them toward the apartment building. As they entered the elevator, the tension between the two men was palpable, like a storm brewing just beneath the surface.

And all the while, Olivia remained blissfully unaware, asleep in the arms of the man who might just change her life forever.
