The Kiss Repaid

Their faces were only an inch apart, eyes locked together. Isabella Peterson's deep, dark eyes gazed intently at Olivia Stewart. Olivia found herself awkwardly unable to continue.

"Close your eyes!" she instructed.

Isabella obeyed, almost like a well-behaved puppy, closing his eyes. His long, curled lashes cast a dense shadow on his sculpted features, trembling slightly as if silently inviting her. It felt like a soft feather gently brushing over Olivia's heart, back and forth.

Staring at him, Olivia's heart skipped a beat. "Oh my gosh! This is just a business deal, why am I feeling this way?" Yet, she couldn't help but want to measure his lashes, couldn't resist the urge to nuzzle his straight nose.

Olivia's gaze fell on Isabella's pink, inviting lips, and she impulsively leaned in to kiss him. The warmth of his lips, with a familiar masculine scent, enveloped her.

She wasn't used to being the initiator, but under Isabella's patient guidance, she'd learned a few tricks. She wanted to mimic his boldness, to tease him back, but lacked the courage. After hesitating for a while, she timidly brushed against his lips and quickly retreated.

Isabella, already on edge, wasn't about to let her escape. He flipped the situation, taking control instantly. The temperature in the air rose, as if about to ignite.

Responding, Olivia clutched Isabella's shirt, while one hand slowly reached for his wrist, feeling the smooth beads of his bracelet. She carefully hooked it, giving it a sudden tug—

"Ouch…" The sharp pain on her lips made her yelp.

"Little troublemaker, focus!" Isabella's husky voice murmured from their joined lips. His hand, adorned with the bracelet, had already captured Olivia's mischievous hand, holding it firmly in place, leaving her no room to move.

Sigh, she thought, losing both the battle and the war!

Olivia internally lamented, realizing she couldn't break free, nor could she outsmart him. She decided to surrender, consoling herself: At least this guy isn't bad-looking, might as well enjoy it for free!

Both were a bit lost in the moment. Olivia's cheeks flushed, eyes dazed, hair tousled, looking even messier. Thankfully, she always managed to maintain a shred of rationality, decisively calling it to a halt.

Isabella's dark eyes had turned a stormy red. He gently tucked a stray lock of her hair behind her ear, his voice rough, "You little temptress, you're going to be the death of me if this keeps up!"

Olivia gritted her teeth, though her face showed a soft, shy expression. Her voice was sweet, almost syrupy, "Uh… can I have my bracelet back now?"

Isabella didn't call her out on her sneaky move during the kiss. Instead, he lifted her chin gently, reminding her, "Sweetheart, you still owe me one hundred ninety-nine kisses."

That's right, she owed him two hundred kisses, and had only repaid one!

"Isabella Peterson—go to hell!" Olivia instantly changed her expression, her voice loud enough to shake the ceiling.

And she wasn't done yet!

"Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell!" she shouted, her fists pounding at him.

Suddenly, Isabella let out a grunt, his body curling up on the couch.

Olivia paused, then continued, "Faking it! I'll show you faking it! Isabella Peterson, you always trick me!"

Isabella stayed silent, letting Olivia hit him.

After a couple of hits, Olivia looked down to see Isabella's tight-lipped expression, his face pale, a sheen of sweat on his forehead.

She panicked, "Isabella Peterson, are you okay?" If something happened to him, wouldn't the Peterson Group come after her?

Isabella finally caught his breath. Seeing her worried face, her big eyes filled with concern, he smiled weakly, "Silly girl! You almost knocked out your future happiness with that punch."

Olivia was about to suggest he take a rest but suddenly realized his teasing, pulling her hand back in embarrassment, muttering, "Serves you right!"

Isabella ended up staying in their small apartment.

Their butler was super efficient, transforming Isabella's room inside and out in half a day. Everything was redone with eco-friendly wallpaper and even the light fixtures were changed to his preferred style.

Unfortunately, the room was too small to fit any of the high-end furniture he was used to. Other than the bed, squeezing in a basic wardrobe was a challenge, earning him plenty of complaints.

Olivia, unable to stand it, leaned against the wall and asked, "If you dislike it so much, why not go back to your castle?"

"Because you're here!" Isabella replied matter-of-factly. "Why don't you come live in the castle with me?"

Finally free, only a fool would go back!

Olivia turned away, but Isabella caught her hand, "How about I redecorate your room too, make it a couple's theme with mine?"

"No change?"

"Why not?"

"One, we're not a couple. Two, it's expensive!"

"You won't have to pay, I've got plenty! Besides, I'm pursuing you, us becoming a couple is just a matter of time!"

He spoke as if she was destined to fall for him!

Olivia rolled her eyes, not wanting to continue this pointless conversation.

"By the way, since you're insisting on staying with us, living here makes you part of the household. We take turns with chores, cooking, and cleaning. You'll have to pitch in."

"No problem!" Isabella agreed easily. With plenty of help at his disposal, he could just have Lucas send over some people.

Olivia stared at him, enunciating, "You have to do it yourself!"

Isabella frowned, then exploded, "What kind of ridiculous rule is that?"

A pampered young master doing chores? Serving others, especially that flamboyant housemate?

"Because we all do it ourselves," Olivia replied coolly, her expression challenging him to figure it out.

This little troublemaker was clearly making things difficult on purpose!

Isabella looked at Olivia, then glanced at Ethan King and Emma Thomas watching the scene, "How about this: I'll have the servants do it, and I'll cover all your chores and meals?"

"Deal!"

Emma immediately agreed, her hand shooting up before pulling it back awkwardly when she saw no reaction from Olivia or Ethan.

Isabella smirked, "Two votes to none, it's settled! Lucas, make the arrangements!"

Lucas nodded with a smile, and Isabella settled into his new armchair, crossing his legs with a smug shake.

Olivia and Ethan exchanged glances.

They'd hoped to scare Isabella off with chores, but it backfired, making it even harder to get rid of him.

Emma quietly retreated to her room, feeling like she'd messed things up again. Normally, Olivia and Ethan weren't great cooks, and she did most of the chores. Having someone to help now was a blessing!

The first night Isabella moved in, dinner arrived from a top hotel, a spread of exquisite dishes that barely fit their small table, even spilling onto the coffee table.

Olivia couldn't help but admit, having a young master as a roommate had its perks, instantly elevating their lifestyle. She happily invited everyone to sit and eat. After all, it was Isabella's money, might as well enjoy it!

Isabella wasn't used to eating with regular folks, sitting stiffly at the table while the other three dug in with gusto, chatting and gossiping as they ate.

It seemed they'd forgotten about him.

After a while, Olivia looked at Isabella, noticing his stillness. "Join in! Serve yourself, there are no servants here, and if you wait any longer, you'll end up washing the dishes."

Picking up his chopsticks, Isabella lost his appetite. They weren't even using serving utensils, everyone diving into the same dishes—how unsanitary!

He dropped his chopsticks and quietly returned to his room.

Watching his retreating back, Olivia felt a pang of guilt, whispering, "Are we being too harsh? He did pay for dinner, after all."

Ethan waved a dismissive hand, "Don't go soft, Olivia. He might just leave if he can't handle it. Do you really want him sticking around to bother you?"

Olivia fell silent, returning to her meal. But the delicious food didn't taste as good anymore.

Emma suggested, "Maybe we should save some for him?"

"No need, he's a germaphobe, he won't eat it!"

So, the three enjoyed a feast while Isabella went hungry.

That night, they each went to bed.

Isabella lay awake, tossing and turning.

The nightlight was too bright, the bed too small, the mattress too firm… nothing felt right.

Finally, he lay staring at the ceiling, thoughts drifting to Olivia asleep next door.

The thought of her so close made his heart itch, like weeds growing wild.

Isabella got up, quietly opening his door, and tiptoed toward the next room...
