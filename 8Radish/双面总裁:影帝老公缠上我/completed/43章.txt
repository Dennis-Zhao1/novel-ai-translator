Olivia Stewart's heart nearly stopped when Isabella Peterson's hand tightened around her neck. Her face went pale, and the dessert dish she was holding slipped from her grasp, crashing to the floor. The answer was as clear as day.

Isabella didn't care about the mess now decorating her pants. She stepped right through it, confronting Olivia with an intense glare. "Well?" she demanded, her grip firm on Olivia's chin, forcing her to meet her eyes.

Under that sharp gaze, Olivia felt exposed, like a jester in a court. She lowered her eyes, her long lashes hiding the storm of emotions beneath. "There was... once... at the club..." she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The memory of suffocating pain and the terrifying sensation of choking flashed through her mind. Her eyes, usually bright, brimmed with tears as Isabella's face loomed larger and blurrier.

Isabella's fingers tightened even more, her hand a vice. Olivia's face flushed red, but she refused to beg for mercy. Her eyes slowly closed.

Suddenly, Isabella released her, punching the nearby coffee table in frustration. The glass surface cracked dramatically, spider-webbing out from her fist.

Olivia staggered back, clutching her sore neck, her whole body shaking like a leaf. She had come so close to the edge; a little more pressure, another minute, and she might have been gone.

Since she'd known Isabella, she'd never seen such fury. Olivia knew Isabella had a thing about cleanliness, but she never imagined it ran this deep. 

The incident was a scar Olivia wished would remain buried. But Isabella had ripped it open and poured salt in the wound, making her feel like the worst kind of villain.

Olivia's eyes lingered on the cracked tabletop, each fracture a reminder of Isabella's anger. It felt like Isabella's punch had landed on her heart.

Isabella stood there, head bowed, his expression obscured, blood dripping from his fist and seeping into the table's cracks like crimson vines.

"Your hand..." Olivia gasped, concern overriding her own pain.

Isabella seemed unfazed, coldly retracting his hand, letting the blood drip down his pants. Olivia's heart twisted. Despite everything, she couldn't help but worry about him.

She was a particularly private person, and the events from six months ago were something she never wanted to revisit. Back then, Ethan King had stayed by her side, helping her piece herself back together. Now, Isabella had torn that wound wide open, and it hurt a thousand times more.

Olivia pressed her hand to her heart, the pain so acute it was hard to breathe. That night, Daniel Johnson had pushed her into going to that club, insisting it would help her career. She'd had too much to drink and woke up to a nightmare.

She wanted to scream, "Do you think I wanted this?" But the words wouldn't come. The bitterness was too much to swallow.

Isabella's hand trembled, veins bulging with rage. The club... that name was like a curse to him! Half a year ago, he'd been tricked by a producer there, waking up next to a stranger. It was a blemish on his record, a betrayal to someone he cared about.

They stood facing each other, silence stretching between them. If only Olivia could explain more, or Isabella could see the inconsistencies. Why did both their stories lead back to that club?

But they were both too wrapped in their own anguish to speak.

Isabella's face was a mask of icy anger as he turned to leave. He'd spent years trying to prove himself, but now, he was trying to force memories she didn't want. He'd forgotten that time changes everything; five years can turn love into something else entirely.

As he passed by, Olivia saw more than anger in his eyes; she saw an indescribable sadness. It was true; any man would struggle with such a thing, especially someone like Isabella, who couldn't tolerate a single flaw in the woman he loved.

With heavy steps, Isabella left, each one seeming to stomp on Olivia's heart.

Olivia stood on the rooftop terrace, the cool night breeze brushing her face. She touched her cheek, finding it cold and damp. The broken glass table still bore Isabella's blood, like a dark flower blooming amidst the shards.

She leaned closer, almost mesmerized by the sight, until a sharp pain jolted her backâ€”she'd cut her finger on a shard. Blood welled up, joining Isabella's on the table, creating a strangely beautiful yet tragic image.

She chuckled softly, realizing Isabella was like a poison she couldn't help but be drawn to. 

Looking out over the island, the lights shimmered like a fairy tale kingdom. It was Isabella's creation, a dreamscape for someone else. Dreams are fleeting, but having them is better than never dreaming at all.

Olivia moved closer to the edge, wanting to take in every detail of the enchanting view. At least she'd have something to remember.

"Olivia!" a familiar voice called, tinged with worry.

Olivia turned to see Lucas Wright, the family butler, approaching. "What brings you up here, Lucas? Shouldn't you be with Isabella?"

Lucas hurried over, gesturing for her to step away from the edge. "Olivia, it's dangerous over there. Please, come back."

Olivia smiled wryly. "Lucas, you're worried I'll jump, aren't you?"

He shifted uncomfortably. "I just don't want you to accidentally..."

She laughed, a touch of irony in her voice. "You're the cutest old man I've ever met. At first, you were always on Isabella's side, but I get it. You're just doing your job. But your smile is infectious, like a Buddha, always making people happy."

Lucas bowed slightly, "Thank you, Olivia. But please, the wind is strong here, come back."

Olivia's smile was bittersweet. "Don't worry, Lucas. I've been through worse. I'm not about to break over this. The night's too beautiful."

Lucas fidgeted, clearly torn. "Yes, Isabella chose this spot for its beauty. You can come up anytime you like."

"After tonight, I doubt I'll have the chance," she replied softly. "You go ahead, Lucas. I want to be alone for a while."

Lucas hesitated, anxious but smiling. "I haven't enjoyed the view in ages. It's truly something."

Ignoring him, Olivia turned back to the night, her face serene, lost in thought.

Lucas was torn. Isabella needed someone by his side, but he couldn't leave Olivia alone here. What if something happened?

"Olivia, Isabella's not himself," Lucas ventured. "He's had a heart operation before; he shouldn't be drinking. Could you... talk to him?"

Olivia's smile was sad. "If I try to talk him down, he'll probably drink more."

"Then, if I may ask, what happened between you two today?" Lucas's voice was gentle but curious.
