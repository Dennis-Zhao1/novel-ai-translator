Isabella Peterson showed up at Olivia Stewart's door once again. Isabella playfully ruffled Olivia's hair, laughing heartily. "Finally learning to save some money for your man, huh? Not bad!"

Olivia blushed and swatted his hand away. "Who said anything about saving for you? I'm just trying to avoid watching you make a fool of yourself!"

Isabella gave her a mischievous grin. "Don't worry, if you like money, your hubby here will earn it for you. I'll have you counting cash till your hands are tired!"

With a playful punch, Olivia retorted, "Stop calling yourself my husband every other word! Look at you now, there's not a trace of that 'bossy CEO' vibe left, just a street-smart rascal!"

Isabella's eyes glinted as he wrapped her in a tight embrace. "How about now?"

"Isabella, put me down! You—" Her words were swallowed as he kissed her passionately.

The game adaptation of "Send an Angel to Love You," titled "Falling for You," caused quite a sensation upon its launch. Especially during the release event, where the CEO Isabella publicly showed off his affection for Olivia, leaving everyone swooning over their romantic display.

That day, Olivia Stewart became the talk of the town, labeled as the happiest woman in the city, sparking envy among many. Having experienced the ups and downs of life, Olivia didn't care much for such fleeting fame. She was content to focus on her family, raising her children and preparing for her wedding. So, she brushed off the online hype with a soft smile, tending to her baby and awaiting her big day.

But the very next day, Olivia's estranged father, Mr. White, appeared at her doorstep with gifts in hand.

"Mrs. Stewart, Mr. White is here to see you!" the maid reported to Olivia.

No one had a particularly good impression of Mr. White, given his opportunistic nature, so no one referred to him as "sir," especially since Olivia never formally acknowledged him as her father.

Olivia hesitated for a moment. In the past, she would have refused without a second thought. But now, as a mother herself, her heart had softened a bit. After some thought, Olivia handed her baby to the nanny and instructed, "Let him in."

Mr. White followed the maid into the grand hall, immediately awed by the opulent decor—the soaring ceilings, the intricate wall carvings, the oil paintings on the cornices. It all spoke volumes of the owner's wealth and refined taste, something Mr. White's own family could never match.

As he marveled at the surroundings, a wave of insecurity washed over him, making him feel small even before meeting the homeowner.

Olivia descended the staircase gracefully.

"Olivia!" Mr. White approached her, his tone and expression dripping with flattery.

Olivia felt an indescribable sense of distaste. She didn't want to be cold to her so-called father, but he made it so hard to like him.

She pointed to the sofa, "Have a seat."

Her tone was neither warm nor welcoming, just polite and distant.

"Sure thing!" Mr. White sat cautiously at the edge of the sofa, not daring to sit back fully. His obsequious demeanor was almost painful to watch.

When the maid brought in coffee, Mr. White accepted it with both hands, thanking her profusely. Olivia couldn't stand it anymore and said plainly, "You really don't have to do this."

"Yes, yes!" Mr. White placed the coffee on the table, his smile widening. "I knew it! Olivia, you're such a wonderful daughter. Your home feels just like mine—no need for all this formality! Yet my wife and daughter kept reminding me to be mindful. See, doesn't this just create distance?"

As he spoke, he got more comfortable, sprawling out on the single-seater sofa, acting like he owned the place.

Olivia facepalmed. She should have just let him keep his servile attitude!

When she asked why he had come, Mr. White suddenly remembered, "Oh right! Silly me!" He clapped his hands and shouted toward the door, "Bring in the gifts!"

Two servants from the White family came in with bags full of items.

Mr. White beamed, "Olivia, come take a look! Daddy brought you loads of gifts! Since you've just had twins, these are all supplements for you—ginseng, bird’s nest, gelatin..."

Watching him unpack the gifts like a proud peacock, Olivia's lips curled into a faint, icy smile. During her disappearance, the White family hadn't lifted a finger until she was found and hospitalized. They only showed interest once Isabella publicly proposed.

As Mr. White held up two jade pendants meant for the babies, Olivia remained calm and collected. "Mr. White, you're too generous."

Her demeanor was gracious and poised, treating him like any other guest.

But referring to him as "Mr. White" and treating him like a guest put a clear distance between them.

Mr. White's smile froze, and he awkwardly tried to explain, "Olivia, I know these things might not seem like much, especially compared to the Peterson family, but business is tough without their support..."

Finally, he was getting to the point.

Olivia's expression turned serious. "Mr. White, honestly, if you had just spoken up when I was in trouble, I would have gladly acknowledged you as my father. But it's too late now... As for these gifts, you should take them back. Whether they're good or bad isn't the issue; it's just that I can't trust anything prepared by Mrs. White and Mia."

Her words left Mr. White speechless.

He wiped the sweat from his brow, wanting to say more but finding himself unable to under Olivia's clear, unwavering gaze. Olivia saw right through his petty schemes, and the fact she hadn't exploded at him yet was already a mercy. Pushing further would only humiliate himself.

Mr. White thought of asking Olivia to keep the gifts. After all, taking them back would be embarrassing. But he remembered how cunning his wife and daughter could be—if they had tampered with anything, and something went wrong, Isabella wouldn't hesitate to make him pay.

In hindsight, he shouldn't have let them handle the gift preparations!

Realizing he couldn't press further, Mr. White left in disgrace.

Watching her father leave, Olivia sighed, instructing the staff, "Next time he comes, just turn him away."

Such a father was better left out of her life.

With a greedy adoptive father and a scheming biological one, why did they only see her as a pawn? Was she destined to never experience true familial love?

No, she had her children. They would fill the void and heal her wounds.

Olivia tried to comfort herself, but the sadness lingered as she headed upstairs.

When Isabella found out about the incident, he wasted no time in taking action against the White family. Already struggling, they couldn't withstand Isabella's influence. A slight move from him, and the White business declared bankruptcy.

Desperate to cling to the Peterson family's status, Mr. White ended up with nothing, his resentment toward Olivia growing.

At the now-empty White mansion, Grace Martin and Mia were packing. With the house auctioned off to pay debts, they could barely afford a small apartment.

Isabella had been merciful not to leave them in poverty, but instead of gratitude, they harbored hatred toward Olivia.

Mr. White, drunk and despairing in the living room, smashed his glass on the floor, shouting, "You ungrateful brat!"

Grace Martin rushed down from upstairs, "What are you raging about now?"

Mr. White, eyes bloodshot from drinking, slapped Grace hard. "It's all your fault! If you hadn't antagonized Olivia, she'd acknowledge me, and I could be Isabella's father-in-law. Our business wouldn't have collapsed! We'd be rich by now, maybe even rivaling the Petersons!"

"You're dreaming! Look at the mess you've made, all for a thankless child!" Grace clutched her reddened cheek, anger and frustration boiling over.

She had taken pity on Sophia Allen, hiring her as a housemaid, only for her to end up in Mr. White's bed. Two decades later, her daughter stole Mia's fiancé!

They had confronted Olivia at Mr. White's behest, yet now, he laid all the blame on her, resorting to violence. Living like this was unbearable!

Grace sobbed, "Why are you hitting me?"

Fed up with her crying, Mr. White raised his hand again, but a stern voice interrupted, "Stop!"

The room fell silent, the tension palpable.
