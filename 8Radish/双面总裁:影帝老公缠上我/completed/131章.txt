The Drama Runs Deep

"Olivia Stewart!"

Lucas Wright called up to Olivia from downstairs, giving a dramatic bow. "Breakfast is ready. Would you like to eat now?"

Olivia Stewart waved a hand, about to decline, but then thought, why let that jerk ruin her appetite? So, with a nod, she replied cheerfully, "Sure, I'll be down in a minute!"

The breakfast spread was lavish, but the empty seat across from her was a stark reminder of something missing, like a puzzle with a piece gone. Olivia took a delicate pastry, chewing it with little enthusiasm. She managed to drink half a bowl of oatmeal before quietly setting her spoon down.

As she got up to leave, Olivia's eyes drifted once more to the empty chair. Lucas, sensing her thoughts, informed her, "The young master was summoned back to the family estate by Mr. Wright. He might be gone for a few days."

"Good," Olivia thought. As long as he wasn't off meeting that cologne-loving client, he could go wherever!

With her mood inexplicably lifted, Olivia walked with a spring in her step toward the door, even humming a tune as she went. Lucas watched in stunned silence as Olivia fluttered away like a butterfly, puzzled by her sudden cheerfulness at Lucas leaving.

Could it be she's interested in someone else? No, I have to tell Lucas about this!

Arriving at the film set, Olivia found out that her co-star, the heartthrob Ethan, was also absent. He was attending some high-profile film association event for a few days. The director, Mr. Wang, decided to postpone scenes featuring the male lead and focus on shooting others.

Olivia didn't mind. She was busy preparing for her own scenes. Sophie Cook, who had a simpler role, flitted around Olivia, calling her "sister" and helping with costumes, props, and makeup, sticking to her like glue. Olivia found the affection comforting, reminding her of times when there was no rift between them.

But then there was Isabella Peterson, a name that weighed heavily on Olivia’s mind.

Soon, Olivia was ready to return to the set. Lisa, playing the role of the elegant Mrs. Gu, greeted her with a smile, her silk dress glistening. But there was something unsettling in that smile, a premonition Olivia couldn't shake. She rubbed her temples, trying to dismiss the feeling.

Am I just tired from last night?

Sophie noticed, asking with concern, "Sis, are you okay? Do you need a break?"

Olivia waved her off, "No, I'm fine. Just didn't sleep well, that's all."

"I'll get you some coffee!" Sophie offered eagerly, rushing off to the break room.

Lisa sashayed over, her handkerchief fluttering as she spoke in an exaggerated tone, "Oh, have you two patched things up already?"

Olivia frowned, "We're sisters after all. Blood is thicker than water."

"Ha! I guess it's not my place to pry. Just a word of warning, your sister is not as simple as she seems," Lisa said, her fan now a tool of her coquettish antics.

Sophie caught the comment as she returned with coffee. "What are you saying? Stop trying to stir up trouble between us!"

Sophie's anger nearly resulted in a coffee mishap on Lisa's dress. Olivia quickly intervened, "Sophie, calm down. No need to get worked up."

Sophie stamped her foot. "You don't know, sis. Lisa's so jealous of you and Ethan! She was part of the group that hit me during filming!"

Olivia's expression turned icy as she faced Lisa. "Miss Lisa, I won’t dwell on the past, but from now on, if anyone messes with my sister, they mess with me!"

Lisa, sensing the shift, retreated with a warning, "Fine, see if I care. You'll regret it someday!"

Turning away, Lisa clutched her handkerchief tightly, her eyes flashing with malice. Olivia Stewart, you’ll soon be in my grasp!

Half an hour later, they were filming scene ninety-two: Mr. Gu falls for his caregiver, and in a fit of emotional turmoil, collapses. Mrs. Gu discovers the affair and confronts Olivia’s character, delivering a slap.

Before the scene, Sophie tugged on Olivia's sleeve, whispering, "Sis, watch out for Lisa’s tricks!"

Olivia reassured her, "I know. Don't worry about it."

Director Wang stood on a chair, megaphone in hand. "All departments ready, scene ninety-two, action!"

On set, Mrs. Gu stormed into the room, her elegance replaced by raw fury. She kicked open the door, shouting, "You little vixen, get out here!"

Olivia’s character opened the door, bowing timidly. "I’m sorry, ma’am. How is Mr. Gu?"

"How dare you ask! If it weren’t for you, he wouldn’t be in the ER!"

And with that, Mrs. Gu slapped Olivia’s character across the face.

The slap echoed loudly, and everyone froze as Olivia’s cheek turned an angry red, imprinted with five distinct fingers. No one expected Lisa to actually hit her.

"Oh, I got too into character. Sorry, sorry, Olivia, are you okay?" Lisa feigned remorse, rushing to Olivia with apologies.

Olivia clutched her stinging cheek, the pain intense, but she stubbornly refused to cry. Now she understood that eerie smile of Lisa's—she had planned this all along! Claiming she was "too into the role" absolved her of blame.

Director Wang hurried over, his heart sinking at the sight of Olivia’s face. He turned to Lisa, demanding, "What happened?"

Lisa shrugged apologetically, "I'm sorry, Director Wang. You know how I get into character. I lost myself for a moment."

Facing Olivia, Lisa bowed deeply, "Olivia, I'm truly sorry. I'll take responsibility. If it makes you feel better, you can slap me back."

"No need," Olivia replied coldly, forcing back tears.

Lisa's performance was perfect; retaliating would only make Olivia seem petty.

"Thank you, Olivia, for your forgiveness," Lisa said, bowing again. Her humble act as an award-winning actress drew admiration from onlookers, but Olivia saw the glint of triumph in Lisa's eyes.

Olivia clenched her fists at her sides. Was she really going to swallow this indignity?

Suddenly, Sophie burst in, pointing at Lisa. "Stop pretending! Saying you were too into character is just an excuse! This wasn’t some intimate scene with Ethan. It was a simple slap, and you hit her on purpose! A seasoned actress wouldn’t make that mistake!"

Instead of getting angry, Lisa maintained her apologetic demeanor, saying to Sophie, "I understand your anger for your sister. Even if I didn't mean to, it happened. If you think a slap will settle it, go ahead."

Lisa turned her cheek toward Sophie.

"I’ll do just that!" Sophie yelled, charging forward.

Lisa, confident that others would intervene, was caught off guard when Sophie actually swung at her. The slap whistled past Lisa's ear as she dodged, redirecting Sophie’s momentum toward Olivia.

Sophie, realizing she couldn’t stop in time, twisted awkwardly to avoid hitting Olivia, her hand just grazing past Olivia’s ear.

"Thud!"

Sophie landed hard on the floor, narrowly avoiding a prop broom that skittered away.
