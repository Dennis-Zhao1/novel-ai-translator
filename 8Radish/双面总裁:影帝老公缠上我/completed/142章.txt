Sophie Cook had barely stepped into the car when a guy with a scruffy mustache pulled her into a bear hug. The overwhelming stench of sweat and cheap cigarettes hit her like a freight train, making her want to gag. But she held it together, subtly scooting away and putting on her best shy act. "Oh, look at me, all dirty. Maybe we should keep some distance, huh?" she said, batting her eyelashes.

Mustache Man grinned wickedly, pinching her chin. "Don't worry about it. I'm not exactly squeaky clean myself. We're a perfect match, stink and all!"

The guy driving, who had eyes like a goldfish, burst out laughing, his hand casually inching towards her.

Two hours later, the van pulled over on a deserted road in the middle of nowhere. The scene inside was best left undescribed.

Mustache Man, satisfied, lit a cigarette, lounging in the backseat with a sleazy tone. "Well, well, little miss, you did great! Who would've guessed someone so young has been through so much? How about it—interested in making a little movie with us?"

"A movie?" Sophie Cook asked, feigning innocence.

Goldfish Eyes chuckled lewdly. "Yeah, the kind we just showed you—an action-packed love story!"

Sophie Cook shivered, shrinking into the corner. "I don't know about that..."

"Little miss, you might not know this, but those big stars out there? They don't make money nearly as fast as this! Plus, some folks get famous doing this, you know."

Sophie Cook's mind raced. In her line of work, she knew these stories all too well.

"How about a few close-ups right now?" Mustache Man flipped on the car's light, reaching for his camera. But when he saw Sophie Cook's face, he froze, cursing under his breath. "What the heck? You've got the face of a devil and the body of an angel, but all backward!"

Sophie Cook touched the scars on her face, a pang of bitterness in her chest. If she'd known she'd pay such a high price, she never would've tried to win Olivia Stewart's trust. That so-called sisterly bond had cost her dearly. Olivia wasn't all guilty and remorseful, was she? Not when she was off with Isabella Peterson, leaving Sophie to fend for herself against these creeps.

Sophie Cook clenched her fists, then suddenly smiled. "It's just a face, right? I have a solution."

Mustache Man stroked his chin. "What kind of solution? Spill it."

Sophie Cook whipped out her phone, scrolling to a photo of her and Olivia Stewart. "Take a look at this face."

Mustache Man snatched the phone, eyes lighting up. "Isn't that the lead actress from that popular show right now?"

"Yep!" Sophie Cook beamed. "That's my sister!"

"Your sister?" Mustache Man and Goldfish Eyes yelled in disbelief.

"Yep, that's Olivia Stewart, red-hot right now! If I do a movie for you guys and swap in her innocent face, what do you think?"

Mustache Man and Goldfish Eyes exchanged glances, clapping their hands in excitement. "That would be fantastic! Hahaha..."

"From now on, Sophie Cook will rely on you two big brothers!" she said sweetly, though a glint of venom flashed in her eyes.

Olivia Stewart, I'm going to make a fortune, fix my face, and then—see you fall from grace!

The next morning, Olivia Stewart woke up feeling like she'd been run over by a truck, achy and sore all over.

Ugh—what a jerk!

She frowned in irritation, only to find a handsome face inches from hers as soon as she opened her eyes.

"Awake?" Isabella Peterson murmured, his voice smooth as silk.

Olivia blushed, turning away.

Isabella carefully cradled her, mindful of the bruises on her back, and turned her face toward him. "Not satisfied with my performance last night, huh?"

Olivia rolled her eyes dramatically, grumbling, "Satisfied! Very satisfied! Happy now?"

Isabella laughed, flicking her nose playfully. "Then how about rewarding me again?"

"No way!" Olivia shot back, refusing him flat out.

She turned away, trying to give him a haughty back, but Isabella had her pinned in no time, his voice a teasing growl above her. "What do you think you're doing? Don't you know your back's still injured?"

For crying out loud!

You didn't seem to care about my back last night!

Olivia wanted to snap at him, but past experience taught her better. Arguing with the infamous Isabella Peterson always ended with her losing every time.

Pouting, she huffed, "Let go, I need to get up!"

Isabella released her, propping himself up lazily like a contented predator. Watching Olivia's adorable sulking, he asked softly, "What do you want to do? I'll take care of it for you."

His deep voice was smooth and laid-back, but to Olivia, it sounded infuriatingly smug.

She shot him a glare, retorting, "I need to use the bathroom!"

Isabella got up and scooped her into his arms.

Olivia panicked, pounding on his chest. "Hey, hey, put me down! What are you doing?"

Isabella chuckled, looking down at her. "Aren't you going to the bathroom?"

What the heck?

Was he really going to help her use the bathroom?

The thought of it, oh boy...

No way!

Olivia clung to his neck, squirming uncomfortably. "Uh, I, I... I don't need to anymore. How about I go myself?"

Isabella watched her flustered, embarrassed expression, unable to resist dropping a kiss on her forehead. "Silly."

At the bathroom door, he set her down, patting her head. "Go on."

He even closed the door for her, being surprisingly thoughtful.

Oh, thank goodness, just to the door!

Olivia sighed in relief, patting her chest. Who would've thought the notoriously sharp-tongued Isabella Peterson could be so sweet? She leaned against the door, a secret smile spreading across her face.

After freshening up, Olivia stepped out to find Isabella waiting right outside.

Her big eyes blinked. "Why are you still here?"

"Waiting for you!" Isabella replied, sweeping her back into his arms.

Olivia wrapped her arms around his neck, playfully nuzzling against him. "Young master, I just came from the bathroom. You sure you want to be this close?"

Sure enough, Isabella wrinkled his nose.

Olivia giggled, flashing her pearly whites. This neat freak was so easy to mess with!

She was always on the receiving end of his teasing, so any chance to get back at him was a victory.

Just as she was laughing, Isabella buried his face in her neck, inhaling her sweet scent.

Olivia's laughter died instantly, and she tugged at his hair, shouting, "Hey, Isabella, what are you doing?"

After a long moment, Isabella lifted his head, playfully rubbing his face against her.

"Bad guy!"

Olivia smacked him lightly, like a cat pawing at him.

He blinked innocently. "Weren't you the one who asked me to smell?"

Oh, come on!

Not like that!

Olivia was left speechless, her cheeks burning as she looked away.

Isabella chuckled, leaning in to nip her neck.

"Ah!" Olivia yelped, shivering.

For Pete's sake!

This guy was getting worse!

"Isabella, put me down!"

"Nope!"

"I can walk!"

"But you're tired."

"I..."

Olivia opened her mouth but didn't dare say anything.

Admitting she wasn't tired would lead to another round of being thoroughly cuddled.

Besides, she really was exhausted. He'd come home like a starving wolf, leaving her feeling like she'd just run a marathon.

So Olivia settled comfortably in his arms, letting him carry her.

If he wanted to hold her, fine. Being independent was great and all, but having someone to lean on felt pretty wonderful.

Isabella carried her downstairs, their breakfast filled with sweet moments. Of course, that was if you ignored the knowing smiles of the staff.

Isabella ate with grace, quick and silent.

Olivia, not so much. She went for whatever tasted good.

According to Peterson family rules, meals were silent affairs. But...

Olivia, head tilted, nibbled on her chopsticks, sneaking glances at Isabella. Her delicate brows furrowed and relaxed, her face a picture of indecision.

He seemed in a good mood. Should she say it? Should she?

Isabella finished his oatmeal, wiping his mouth with a towel. Seeing Olivia's expression, he tapped the table. "Why are you staring instead of eating?"

"Uh... you're good-looking."

"Want to see an album upstairs?"

"N-no!"

Olivia quickly buried her face in her oatmeal. "Slurp—"

Isabella frowned in distaste. "Olivia, how many times have I told you? No slurping. You look like a pig in a hurry!"

Olivia put her bowl down, pouting. "Not as elegant as you!"

And in her mind, she added: A wolf in sheep’s clothing!
