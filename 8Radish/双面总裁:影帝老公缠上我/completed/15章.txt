Title: A Meal to Remember

---

"Isabella, how can you do this? Taking advantage when I'm down, bullying the weak, you..." Olivia Stewart was so flustered she couldn't even find the right words to hurl at him.

Swearing might have felt satisfying, but there'd be consequences. Cursing without the actual curse words? Too much effort! Olivia just turned her head away in frustration. She was determined to stand her ground.

Isabella Peterson suddenly chuckled, his smile dazzling like a well-polished diamond. He gently turned Olivia's head back to face him, his deep eyes capturing hers with an intensity that was hard to shake off. His voice was a low whisper, "Food and love are basic desires."

Well, that was his way of explaining human nature.

It took Olivia a moment to find her voice again. "Seriously?"

Just then, an inconvenient rumble echoed from her stomach, causing her to blush with embarrassment. They'd been at it since the morning, and she hadn't had a bite to eat yet.

Isabella's gaze flickered to her stomach, his eyes skimming over her curves with a playful glint. "I'm hungry too," he said in a voice that was both teasing and sultry.

Olivia quickly rolled away, fearing that if she stayed any longer, Isabella might just pounce on her. She scrambled up from the floor, pulled out a chair, and sat down with a grin. "Well, let's eat together then!"

Isabella, amused and a bit exasperated, slowly got up without a hint of disarray, maintaining his air of cool elegance. He walked over, sat next to Olivia, and casually draped an arm over the back of her chair, creating an intimate little cocoon around her.

Olivia felt the air around her thin out. She avoided looking at Isabella, grabbed her chopsticks, and started piling food onto her plate, not caring what it was as long as it filled her hungry stomach. She stuffed her cheeks full, imagining the dumplings and meatballs were Isabella himself, and chewed with determination.

Isabella, meanwhile, didn't touch his chopsticks. He just watched Olivia with deep, thoughtful eyes as she ate. Her lips, slightly swollen from earlier, glistened with a glossy sheen, and her enthusiasm for the food seemed to enhance her charm.

Feeling his gaze, Olivia quickly picked up a dumpling for him. "You should eat too!"

Isabella looked at the dumpling on his plate, then at Olivia, finally picking up his chopsticks and taking a bite. "Hmm, not bad," he commented with a hint of hidden meaning.

Outside the dining room, the staff were shocked. Isabella was known for his strict cleanliness. Usually, even the slightest disturbance during meals would have him demanding a full reset. Yet here he was, eating something Olivia had touched without a fuss.

Lucas Wright, the butler, smirked knowingly and shooed the onlookers away, but he himself lingered by the door, thoroughly entertained.

Olivia, famished and tired from the morning's antics, kept eating with gusto. She was just reaching for another dish when Isabella nudged her elbow, causing a meatball to roll off her chopsticks. She glared at him. "What?"

Isabella nodded towards the beef meatball. "I'm waiting for you to serve me."

"Can't you do it yourself?" Olivia muttered, reluctantly picking up the meatball. "This feels weird," she whispered under her breath.

Isabella's eyes glinted with amusement. "I prefer it this way."

As she was about to place the meatball on his plate, Isabella leaned forward and bit it right off her chopsticks. Feeding had turned into something much more intimate.

Olivia's cheeks flushed. "You..."

"Keep going," Isabella said, as if this was the most natural thing in the world.

"Uh, why don't you just use your own chopsticks?" she suggested, feeling the heat rise in her cheeks.

Isabella's gaze was unwavering, and Olivia, feeling a bit intimidated, obediently continued to feed him. Every time, Isabella was quick to intercept her chopsticks, turning the meal into a bizarre yet oddly cozy experience.

Trying to break the silence, Olivia asked, "Why do they call you 'Second Master'? Do you have an older brother?"

Isabella's chewing paused, his expression darkening. It was clear this wasn't a topic he wanted to explore. Oblivious to his discomfort, Olivia pressed on, "Or is it because you're... well, you know, a bit extra?"

"Pfâ€”" Isabella, notorious for his fastidiousness, actually spluttered, spraying the table.

Olivia blinked in surprise, but then her face lit up with mischief. "Did I guess wrong?"

"Enough," Isabella sighed, grabbing a napkin to clean up. He glared at Olivia, who was smiling like she'd just won a prize.

"Lucas!" he bellowed.

"Yes, sir!" Lucas dashed in, his hair fluttering.

"From now on, no one is to call me 'Second Master'!"

"Yes, yes... sir!" Lucas stammered, before dashing out as Isabella shot him a withering look.

Olivia couldn't help it; she burst out laughing. Isabella's reaction was priceless.

"You did that on purpose, didn't you?" Isabella accused, though there was a hint of amusement in his eyes.

"Sorry, 'Second Master'!" Olivia teased before darting out of the room, quick as a rabbit.

Standing in the doorway, Isabella watched her retreating figure, a sly smile playing on his lips. Oh, he'd let her run for now, but there'd be a time when she'd come to him willingly.
