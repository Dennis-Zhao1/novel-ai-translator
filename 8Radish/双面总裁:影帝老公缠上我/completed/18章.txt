The Coffee Spill

“Whoosh—”

With a swift flick of her hand, Isabella Peterson managed to sacrifice her silk robe in a dramatic fashion.

“Ah!”

Olivia Stewart felt a sudden chill and let out a startled scream, instinctively wrapping her arms around herself, her eyes squeezed shut in embarrassment.

“Heh, you little thing.”

Isabella smirked, her lips curving into a dangerously charming smile that could melt hearts. But Olivia was halfway back to her senses already.

“No way! To him, I’m just another woman. How could I give in so easily?”

Olivia scolded herself for being momentarily swept away by emotions. A girl’s gotta have boundaries—no matter how handsome the guy, you can look but not touch!

“Isabella, let me go!”

“No, Olivia. I’ve wanted you for so long, Olivia, give me this.”

Isabella’s voice was husky and low, barely more than a murmur. Olivia struggled fiercely, trying to dodge.

The sound of her name, Olivia, was like a bucket of ice water, snapping her back to full consciousness, pulling her scattered wits together.

“Isabella… no…”

Olivia’s struggle turned into a plea, her voice choked and thick with emotion, her chest heaving from the effort.

Isabella looked up, her gaze blurred as she stared into Olivia’s tear-filled eyes, her grip unconsciously loosening. He didn’t want to see her upset.

Olivia glanced to the side and saw a shelf nearby. Seized by a sudden inspiration, she kicked out at it with all her might. The shelf wobbled but didn’t fall, though a vase did tumble off, landing right on Isabella’s desk and knocking over a coffee cup.

“Crash!”

“Splash—”

The sound of shattering porcelain was followed by a cup of coffee splashing all over Isabella’s back.

“Olivia!”

Isabella lifted herself partially, her handsome face now dark with anger, her eyes wide with a glare that seemed to want to swallow Olivia whole.

He was a neat freak.

That cup of coffee ruined any mood there might have been!

Olivia wriggled out from under Isabella, scooted back, and quickly wrapped the torn robe around herself before dashing out of the room. She didn’t even stop to grab her phone.

Back in her room, Olivia changed out of her ruined clothes, still feeling a lingering sense of fear. Jeez, she nearly lost everything there!

Thinking back on it… she couldn’t believe she almost fell for it! Olivia’s cheeks flushed again with embarrassment.

But she had to focus on the matter at hand! Her phone! Without it, how could she call for help?

Olivia gave herself a little pep talk. Right, she could try using the house phone to sneak a call out!

Tiptoeing to the room with a phone, she tried to call Ethan King, only to find all the lines were internal… She’d have to find a way to get her phone back!

After a night of restless pacing, she decided—

To steal it back!

Early the next morning, Olivia got up quietly, sneaking towards Isabella’s study. The door was ajar, and Olivia quickly glanced around before slipping inside, heading straight for the desk drawer. She pulled it open—where was her phone?

“Looking for this?”

Olivia looked up to see Isabella lounging against the window sill, casually twirling her phone between two fingers.

Seeing Isabella brought back memories of the previous day, and her face flushed again. But seeing her phone—

That scheming guy! He went and did this!

“Give it to me!”

Olivia made a move to snatch it, but hesitated, fearing she’d end up worse off.

Isabella smirked, “Your friend called you a thousand and one times last night. What's the story?”

Just then, the phone rang again. Isabella answered it leisurely, and Ethan King’s anxious voice came through: “Olivia, you finally picked up! Where are you? Are you okay?”

“With me here, how could she not be okay?”

Seeing Isabella answer her call, Olivia rushed over, but Isabella easily pinned her against the window sill, covering her mouth.

Olivia struggled, “Mmm, mmmph…”

Isabella moved the phone slightly away, “She’s in the shower right now, can’t take the call. If it’s urgent, want me to take the phone in to her?”

The other end of the line went silent.

“Oh, she asked me to get her a robe, so… I’ll hang up now.”

Isabella hung up and tossed the phone onto the desk, looking quite satisfied as he released Olivia, a triumphant smile playing on his lips.

“Isabella, who gave you the right to answer my phone? You jerk! You…”

“Your mouth’s pretty sharp, but I like it.”

“Go die somewhere!”

Olivia shoved Isabella, her face flushed with fury.

Isabella stared unabashedly at her lips, his gaze openly devouring.

“You want to punish me again, huh? Go ahead, I’ve already kissed you before! Isabella, bullying a woman, you’re despicable, shameless, and indecent! You’re morally bankrupt, intellectually deficient, and have zero integrity…”

Olivia launched into a tirade, her words firing off like a machine gun, no punctuation needed. When she finally exhausted her vocabulary of insults, she paused to catch her breath, feeling much better.

“One hundred and ninety-eight, sweetheart. You really do spoil your man, don’t you? I’m practically bubbling with happiness. But are you sure your pretty lips can handle such abuse?”

Olivia froze, envisioning a comically oversized sausage lip in her mind.

Oh my gosh!

Shouldn’t have indulged in trash-talking on impulse!

But how could she swallow her pride?

“Isabella, didn’t your elementary school teacher ever teach you? Who gave you the right to answer my calls? You’ve ruined my reputation!”

“That reputation was gone five years ago, thanks to me.”

Five years ago, she was only eighteen!

“Shameless!”

“One hundred and ninety-nine.”

Olivia hesitated, then realized what he meant, immediately aiming a kick at Isabella. Can’t insult you? Then I’ll just kick you!

Isabella caught her ankle effortlessly, his grip perfectly balanced so she couldn’t kick him or pull away, leaving her in a precarious one-legged stance.

“Fair and shapely, sweetheart, your legs are beautiful.”

Isabella’s thumb gently caressed her ankle, his gaze tracing up her leg.

She was still in her nightgown!

“Thinking of replaying yesterday’s drama?” Isabella grinned mischievously.

Olivia quickly pressed down her skirt with both hands, stumbling slightly as she did so.

Isabella let go and steadied her with a hand on her waist.

“Feeling adorable…”

The phone on the desk rang again, and Olivia, barely upright, lunged for it first.

But Isabella had longer arms.

“Hey, Olivia, what’s going on? It’s late, and you still aren’t at work? Do you still want your attendance bonus this month?”

“What’s with the shouting? You grouchy, ugly, menopausal woman! Don’t call again, she quit!”

“No, it’s not true! Boss, let me explain…”

The call was already disconnected.

You can’t just sabotage me like this!

“Isabella!”
