Title: Sorry, Olivia

"Olivia Stewart, I'm sorry!"

Olivia froze as she stared at the familiar, bold handwriting. It was Isabella Peterson's.

But the room filled with romantic balloons and flowers? That definitely wasn't his style. His mind was usually occupied with code and stock data, not grand gestures.

She hesitated at the threshold, debating whether to continue forward. But her feet moved before her mind could decide otherwise.

A few steps ahead, another red rose had a card attached. Olivia picked it up and read: "Olivia Stewart, I love you!"

Her heart raced, and a blush spread across her cheeks. Isabella Peterson wasn't exactly the type to sweet-talk. Even his concern typically sounded like scolding. Yet, here he was, professing love.

She could almost picture the awkward expression on his face as he wrote those words.

The icy barrier around her heart shattered, replaced by a gentle warmth that spread through her.

Olivia scolded herself for being so easily swayed, but she couldn't bring herself to let go of the roses.

She continued forward, picking up roses as she went, each with a message that made her frown, smile, or roll her eyes. By the time she reached the end of the trail, her arms were full.

Up on the rooftop, Isabella watched Olivia's every expression through the security cameras. His eyes were filled with a love so deep it was almost overwhelming.

In one hand, he clutched a small, elegant ring box, his fingers betraying his nervousness.

The last proposal had been for show. This time, he would kneel as himself, Isabella Peterson, and ask the woman he loved to be his forever.

Would Olivia forgive him? Would she say yes?

His palms were sweaty with anticipation as he watched her approach the rooftop stairs. But just then, his phone buzzed.

Frustrated, Isabella pulled out his phone, ready to silence it, when a message flashed across the screen: "Dear brother, want to see your son one last time?"

Alexander Peterson!

Isabella's brow furrowed, his hand clenching into a fist. He had never given up searching for his child, and now he knew the boy was in Alexander's hands.

He couldn't afford to stay. Happiness was within reach, but he had to act now.

He had learned earlier about Alexander's twisted natureâ€”it was practically an open secret. If anything happened to the child, how could Olivia bear it?

As Isabella disappeared down the stairs, Olivia reached the rooftop, following the path of red roses.

The rooftop was a sea of roses, each one fresh and vibrant, but the person she expected to find was nowhere in sight.

She hadn't been ready to face Isabella again, hesitating at the stairs for a long time. Yet, seeing the empty rooftop filled her with a deep, unexpected sense of loss.

Taking a breath, she stepped forward.

More cards lay on the ground, and her arms were already full. She crouched, picking them up carefully, reading each one.

She believed Isabella owed her an explanation, and he would give it.

As she reached the center of the rooftop, the roses numbered exactly ninety-nine.

Olivia couldn't help but smile.

She stood, enveloped by flowers, and brushed against a flower ball. Red rose petals rained down from above.

She looked up to see a giant heart-shaped balloon with a long ribbon, inscribed with: "Olivia Stewart, will you marry me?" Next to it, roses spelled out "I LOVE YOU," dazzling in her eyes.

This man...

Her heart softened, and she closed her eyes, imagining the quirky way Isabella might appear.

One minute, two minutes...

Her neck ached from looking up, but nothing happened.

Opening her eyes, the rooftop was still empty and silent. Not even a bird in sight.

What kind of proposal was this? So romantic, yet he didn't even show up? Was she being stood up?

Frustrated, Olivia let the roses in her arms fall to the ground.

She scanned the empty rooftop once more, ready to leave. As she lifted her foot, she paused, unwilling to step on the "I love you" message, and bent down to pick up the roses again.

As she gathered them, a shadow fell over her. Olivia looked up, expecting Isabella, but found Lucas Wright, the old butler, instead. Her hope turned to disappointment.

Having the butler stand in for a proposal? What a joke!

Lucas looked sheepish at Olivia's changing expressions and hurried to explain, "Olivia, don't be mad. The young master had an urgent matter and left. Let me help you pick these up. It's not good for you to crouch for long, especially now."

"Never mind, I don't want them!" Olivia snapped, turning to leave.

Isabella was treating her like a puppet. What could be more urgent than this? If he didn't have time, why go through all this trouble?

Lucas called after her, "Olivia, he really had an emergency at the old family estate. I can't say more now, but I promise it's for your future together!"

Olivia paused, her tone still cold, "Let him be busy then. I won't hold him back. There's something more important at the old estate."

Was it that woman, Sophie Cook, who needed him?

Lucas quickly handed Olivia some documents, "You've misunderstood. Sophie Cook was created by Alexander to sow discord. She's not who you think."

"What?" Olivia was shocked, flipping through the pages, her expression growing darker.

Lucas warned her, "Don't get upset. You have the baby to think about."

As she read, Olivia realized why Isabella had been so distant. During his recovery, Alexander had orchestrated a series of staged encounters with Sophie Cook to drive a wedge between them.

No wonder Isabella had been so cold. Most men wouldn't tolerate such betrayal, and it was a miracle he hadn't lashed out more.

Her resentment softened somewhat.

After a moment, Olivia asked quietly, "Where is Sophie Cook?"

Lucas hesitated before answering, "She was sent to seduce the young master and failed. After that, Alexander..."

Olivia sighed deeply, "If she's set on this path, she has herself to blame. I knew Alexander was deceitful, but I didn't realize the extent of his cruelty."

She handed the documents back, her face calm again.

"Lucas, go back and help Isabella. I can take care of myself."

Lucas looked at her hopefully, "Will you forgive him?"

Olivia hesitated, then sighed, "We'll see. These misunderstandings were Alexander's doing, but if Isabella didn't have doubts, Alexander wouldn't have succeeded."

Lucas was at a loss for words. Trust should be absolute, yet how many could maintain such clarity?

He bowed deeply, "Olivia, I know I have no right to ask, but the young master can't be without you. After your last breakup, he drank himself into a hospital with a bleeding ulcer."

"What?" Olivia was shocked, frowning, "When was this? Why didn't I know?"

"During Ethan King's accident. He was in the hospital, hoping you'd come, but wouldn't let us tell you. When you returned to ask for help about Sophie Cook, he thought it was for Ethan's medical bills and got angry."

"That idiot!"

Olivia stomped her foot.

"Lucas, go back and watch him. Don't let him drink again! A bleeding ulcer is serious. Tell him if he drinks, he'll never see me again!"

Her voice was full of worry and care, though she didn't realize it.

Lucas grinned like a flower, nodding enthusiastically.
