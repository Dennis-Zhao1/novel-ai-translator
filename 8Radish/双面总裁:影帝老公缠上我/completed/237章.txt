Title: The Truth Behind the Viral Clip

Isabella Peterson, a renowned actor, suddenly remembered his identity as a tech genius. Without lifting his head, his fingers danced rapidly over the keyboard, injecting a self-destruct virus into the viral videos spreading online.

Olivia Stewart was beside herself with worry, stomping her foot. "Why are you so upset with Sophie Cook?" she demanded.

"Fool!" Isabella snapped, disdain dripping from his voice. Olivia blinked in disbelief. His tone, the icy demeanor—it was like Isabella's clone! If not for their different faces and voices, she might have thought she was seeing things.

Just as she was about to ask again, her phone buzzed. Olivia glanced down to find a notification from an app. She was about to dismiss it but was shocked by the scandalous advertisement featuring herself: "New sensation Olivia Stewart's passionate performance! Click to watch!"

"When did I ever film something like this?" Olivia's anger and shock compelled her to click the link—

"Bang!" Her phone screen went black with a gory image. It was a virus. Olivia pressed a few buttons, but her phone was unresponsive. "Who the heck is so despicable to do this?" she grumbled, pained by her phone's sudden death.

Meanwhile, Isabella finished his coding and shut the laptop with a decisive snap. He glanced at Olivia, his expression grim.

"Uh..." Olivia hesitated. "What did Sophie Cook do to upset you? Can I apologize on her behalf? Could I see her?"

"You want to see her? You'll see her soon enough!" Isabella's deep voice carried an unprecedented chill. Grabbing Olivia's hand, he led her out, his cold aura enveloping her.

As they walked, Isabella made a call. "Arrange a press conference immediately! Invite all media—entertainment, news, doesn't matter if they're seasoned or tabloid reporters, get them all here!"

His commanding presence reminded Olivia of Isabella. She found herself mesmerized by his profile.

Half an hour later, the press conference was set in the grandest room of the entertainment empire. Olivia sat in the front row, flanked by two plainclothes bodyguards.

Isabella took the stage, and the giant screen behind him displayed an incriminating video. The star of the clip was unmistakably Olivia.

Olivia's eyes widened, her face turning ashen. "Isabella, what is this supposed to mean?" she shouted, standing abruptly and knocking over her chair with a loud crash.

The room, filled with hundreds of journalists and media personnel, erupted in chaos. This was the viral sensation from half an hour ago, and the sudden press conference was about this!

Cameras flashed, and reporters scribbled furiously. Isabella's voice boomed through the microphone, commanding calm. "Friends from the media, please hold your questions until after the conference!"

The room fell silent, his voice carrying an unseen authority. Isabella's gaze met Olivia's. "You too, sit down!"

"I didn't film this!" Olivia protested loudly. How could she sit in a moment like this? A mere glance from Isabella, and the bodyguards seated her forcibly.

Olivia, furious, yelled, "Isabella, you jerk! You're a wolf in sheep's clothing!"

Isabella's cold gaze landed on Olivia's fuming face. "If you can't stay quiet, I won't hesitate to tape your mouth shut!"

Olivia opened her mouth but ultimately stayed silent, bowing to the circumstances. She had to see what Isabella was planning.

Isabella surveyed the vast room, his gaze not lingering on anyone but exuding an undeniable presence.

Once he had everyone's attention, he spoke slowly. "I'm sure you've all seen this viral video from half an hour ago?"

"I'm not here to deny it for the entertainment empire because it's real!"

The room gasped collectively! Olivia tried to stand again, only to be restrained and gagged by the bodyguards.

"Mm, mmm..." Olivia glared at the bodyguard, struggling against her bonds. The bodyguard silently threatened her with a soft rope, the message clear.

Olivia slumped like a wilted flower. Isabella had always protected her, yet here he was, presenting this false video to the media. What was he thinking?

Confused, Olivia looked towards Isabella on stage. He returned her gaze, his blue eyes softening, giving her a reassuring nod.

Olivia inexplicably felt at ease. She signaled to the bodyguard that she wouldn't cause trouble. The bodyguard looked to Isabella, then carefully removed the tape from her mouth.

Olivia exhaled, remaining silent but watching Isabella intently, waiting for an explanation.

Isabella tapped his fingers on the table, each tap resonating like a piano key, drawing everyone's focus.

The room quieted. Olivia watched Isabella with anticipation. He had to have a way to clear her name, right?

Isabella spoke again, stunning everyone: "Let's take a look at this video everyone loves!"

The room buzzed like a boiling pot. Olivia nearly fainted.

Isabella ignored the uproar, opening his laptop and running analysis software on the video, projecting the process onto the big screen.

The audience couldn't decipher the rapidly changing data and code but watched in awe at Isabella's skill and focus.

Wow, he's so cool! Olivia briefly lost herself, reminded of Isabella's dedication when working. She shook her head to clear her thoughts. Was she imagining things?

Minutes later, something strange happened—the incriminating video began to change. The only alteration was Olivia's innocent face morphing into someone else's.

Her bangs receded, her eyes shrank, her expression turned indulgent, her face rounded, and her chin softened.

Olivia stared, nails digging into her palms, drawing blood. But she didn't notice, too focused on the screen.

The face transformed into someone she knew well—Sophie Cook!

Sophie Cook had filmed this! Lost in the entertainment world's allure, she had never changed. If forced, her eyes wouldn't have held such pleasure!

Considering how the video spread online and Isabella's sudden detainment of Sophie, Olivia's face turned ghostly pale.

If she still didn't understand, she truly was a fool! No wonder Isabella called her an idiot earlier!

Recalling the past scandal, unwanted truths flooded her mind. What had Sophie, her own sister, done to her?

A wave of pain and disappointment overwhelmed Olivia. She closed her eyes, biting her lip to stifle her cries.

The crimson seeped from her lips, stark against her pale skin, a haunting beauty.

Isabella, observing Olivia, felt a deep, hidden sympathy. Despite the pain, he had to rid Olivia of this toxic presence!

Facing the future with the Group Peterson would be tougher, but she had to grow!

With the video analysis complete, the screen still displayed the incriminating scene. As Isabella said, the video was real, not doctored. But the lead role had changed to Sophie Cook!

Sophie had altered her face to Olivia's through technology, and now, Isabella was reversing it, revealing everything clearly.

More convincing than any verbal denial!

The audience, mainly entertainment reporters, understood immediately. They were familiar with such dirty tricks in the industry. Condemnation poured in for Sophie, demanding her removal from the entertainment company.

Even as a minor role, she was a blemish on their eyes!

Isabella signaled, and the bodyguards brought Sophie out. The crowd erupted, throwing pens, notebooks, and microphones at her. A bold individual even hurled a camera her way...

And so, the truth unraveled, with Olivia and Isabella standing amidst the chaos, determined to set things right.
