**The Star Is Coming**

Driving Olivia Stewart to downtown Golden City for a shopping spree was Michael Wright. Initially, Lucas Wright had arranged for a whole entourage, but Olivia turned them down. Wandering around with an entire crew would feel like an emperor's parade—who could shop like that?

It had been ages since Olivia hit the streets, so when she finally did, she was like a bird freed from a cage, finding every corner of the city delightfully familiar. The only downside was that her partner-in-crime wasn't around to share the adventure.

After a while, the shopping lost its charm. The bustling streets and food stalls seemed unusually quiet. Most people were headed toward Golden City Theater. Curious, Olivia stopped a young girl to ask, "Hey, what's everyone rushing over there for? Is there a new blockbuster out?"

The girl looked at Olivia as if she were from another planet. "The star, Ethan Yang, is holding a live press conference here! How can you not know?"

Stunned, Olivia realized she'd been living under a rock, thanks to Isabella Peterson's secluded world. She did have a soft spot for Ethan Yang, the actor who often played the charming CEO. Back in the day, she and Ethan King had schemed to get his autograph. Funny how those days seemed so distant now.

"When is it happening? Can't you buy tickets online?"

"You gotta buy them in person. No online sales. Otherwise, why would anyone sweat it out in this heat?"

Before Olivia could ask more, the girl dashed off. Olivia grabbed Michael's arm. "Come on, you're tall and strong. You can help me push through the crowd to get tickets!"

At Golden City Theater, Olivia quickly realized she was dreaming. The line was endless, like a dragon coiling around the block. Without the police maintaining order, it would have been chaos.

People were lining up diligently, and the queue snaked from the theater entrance, winding through several streets. By the time they got in line, they'd probably be waiting until tomorrow morning, with no guarantee of tickets.

But the massive poster on top of the theater was hard to ignore. "Ethan Yang's New Movie Live Press Conference!" This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as the elusive star never did live appearances.

Olivia gazed longingly at the giant ad, feeling a bit heartbroken.

"Feeling cute..." Her new phone still had the same old ringtone.

It was Sophie Cook calling. No doubt, asking for money again. Olivia answered with a sigh. Sophie’s sweet, childlike voice came through. "Sis, can you give me five hundred bucks?"

Five hundred bucks again!

"The last time I gave you five hundred! Do you think I'm running a bank? My job at the coffee shop only pays four hundred a month, and that's if I don't eat!"

"Oh sis, I know you can figure something out! I heard you landed a big client recently, and they’re loaded. Sis, you're not getting any younger. If there's a chance, you should seize it. Don't always play hard to get..."

"Sophie Cook!"

"Okay, sis, I won't say more!"

Sophie’s voice turned soft and pleading. "Sis, please help me out. I need the money for tickets! You don't understand, Ethan Yang's coming to Golden City for a conference. This is such a great opportunity! If your young, beautiful sister can attend, who knows? I might be discovered by the film crew! Sis, once I'm famous, you'll be the star's sister. You'll have all the five hundred bucks you want!"

Olivia rubbed her temples, feeling a headache coming on. "Alright, alright, I'll see what I can do."

"Thanks, sis! You're the best!"

Sophie hung up happily, leaving Olivia to massage her furrowed brow. Her sister's head was filled with nothing but dreams of stardom. If she wasn't asking for money, she'd never call. But with their parents gone, Sophie was Olivia's only family. What else could she do but spoil her?

Olivia checked her flat wallet. She hadn't been to work at the gym in half a month while staying at Isabella's place. Where was she going to get five hundred bucks?

Ask Isabella for a loan? No way, that's too embarrassing! Given their undefined relationship, Olivia resisted the idea of using Isabella's money. Maybe ask Mr. Butler? No, he'd just report to Isabella immediately!

Michael looked at the line. "Olivia, do you still want to queue?"

Olivia stood on her tiptoes to survey the scene. In the time she took the call, the line had grown another hundred meters. By the time they queued, tickets would be gone. Yet, people kept joining the line, not wanting to give up.

Got it!

Olivia snapped her fingers. "Michael, let's head to the wholesale market!"

How on earth did lining up lead to the wholesale market?

Michael was puzzled but followed due to his professional instincts.

Before long, Olivia led Michael to the south city wholesale market. She navigated the aisles confidently until she found a shop selling folding stools. After some haggling with the owner, she bought a bunch of foldable chairs.

While Olivia bargained, Michael discreetly reported to Isabella. Isabella simply said, "Let her do as she pleases, just keep her safe."

Olivia then rented a tricycle, instructing Michael to load it with stools. So, the prestigious head of Group Peterson's security was momentarily a tricycle driver.

After an hour of hustling, they returned to Golden City Theater. The line had stretched further. Olivia had Michael follow with the loaded tricycle while she carried a few stools, calling out, "Folding stools for sale! Handy and stylish folding stools!"

The weary folks in line perked up. Some had been standing for hours and were intrigued by the call.

"Hey there, how much for a stool?"

Olivia rolled her eyes internally at the "little sister" remark; she was twenty-three! But she smiled sweetly and replied, "Folding stools, stylish and practical, just four dollars each!"

Her words were met with a mix of exclamations and grumbles.

"Four bucks? I bought one wholesale for a dollar! Even retail, it's only two!"

Olivia kept smiling sweetly, "Then you can go buy wholesale! It's over at the south market!"

Encouraged by Olivia, the crowd egged him on, "Go on! Even with cab fare, you'll save two bucks!"

The guy glanced around and realized they'd love for him to leave so they could move up in line. "Oh, you all want me to leave, huh? Not happening!"

Olivia chuckled, sat beside the line, and kept calling out, "Folding stools! Four dollars each!"

Finally, someone couldn't resist. "I'll take one!"

"Great! The early bird gets the worm. Supplies are limited!"

"One for me too!"

"And me!"

Soon, people were clamoring for the stools. Olivia saw the stash dwindling quickly. She turned to Michael. "Unload the rest and go get another batch!"

"What about you, Olivia?"

"I'll hire a trustworthy person to watch the stools and do some running. Hurry! Others will catch on, and then stools won't be worth much!"

"Alright!"

Michael quickly unloaded and was about to go when he saw Isabella, wearing large sunglasses and a stern expression. He bowed, "Sir..."

Isabella signaled him to stay silent and waved him off. Michael wisely left, pedaling away to fetch more stools.

Olivia was about to find someone to watch her stuff when she spotted Isabella. Her eyes lit up.

"Isabella!"

She called out softly, recognizing him instantly despite the sunglasses. Isabella's lips curled slightly.

"You came just in time! Help me with the stools!"

Isabella's smile froze in place. Olivia was already tugging his sleeve, "C'mon, you handle the stools, I'll collect the money. We need to be efficient before someone else starts selling stools and ours lose value!"

"You've got a knack for business!" Isabella remarked with a mischievous grin.

"Practice from my street vending days. It's been a while, so I'm a bit rusty. Hurry up! I'll find someone to guard the wares!"

"No need. I'll have my bodyguards watch them. Nobody dares mess with Group Peterson's property!"

The bodyguards behind him sweated nervously. Who would've thought a bunch of stools belonged to the heir of such a powerful company?

"Even better. Just have one guard them, and the rest can help with sales. You too!" Olivia commanded.

And so, the real estate mogul's son became Olivia's assistant, carrying stools as she collected cash. They made a surprisingly good team.

Soon, others saw the opportunity and began selling stools in bulk. With competition, prices dropped to three dollars, two dollars, even one dollar.

"Look at that!"

Olivia felt disheartened. At a dollar, she'd only profit a quarter. What's the point?

Just as Olivia was about to lower her prices in defeat, she noticed something odd: people ignored the one-dollar stools and eagerly reached for hers at four dollars.

What was going on?

Had everyone lost their minds?
