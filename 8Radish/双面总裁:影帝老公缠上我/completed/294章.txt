**The CEO's Wife**

Isabella Peterson blinked, trying to make sense of the situation. “Which woman are you talking about again?”

Olivia Stewart nearly spat out her drink, exasperated. “Isabella, are you seriously pretending? The woman you were just eyeing to your left. Don’t even try to say you didn’t see her!”

Isabella paused for a moment before it clicked. “Oh, I seriously didn’t notice. I was distracted by a bird flying outside…”

“Isabella, could you come up with a lamer excuse?” Olivia was on the verge of disbelief, her expression a mix of frustration and amusement.

Isabella suddenly realized—Olivia was jealous! This revelation made her burst into uncontrollable laughter, clutching her sides.

“You…” Olivia blushed, feeling both embarrassed and annoyed, her eyes glowing like a cat ready to pounce.

Isabella grabbed Olivia’s hands, gently pulling her into a hug. “I did see a bird, but guess what I was thinking?”

Olivia couldn’t resist her curiosity and looked up, ready to hear whatever absurdity would come next.

“I immediately thought of you! You’re both just so cute…”

Olivia’s lips curled up involuntarily—this guy really knew how to talk!

“Chubby and round!”

Oh, come on!

Olivia’s smile froze, and she started playfully punching Isabella’s chest. “Take that, and that!”

Isabella chuckled, enjoying the playful punches as if they were tickles, feeling relaxed and content.

Once Olivia had vented enough, she dramatically declared, “I’m going on a diet!”

“No way!” Isabella quickly intervened. “I love you just the way you are! Since our two little ones came along, my life has been so much richer. Don’t deny me…”

“Shut up!” Olivia glared at him. Seriously, was he acting like they were at home?

“Okay, okay, I’ll stop!” Isabella coaxed. “Come on, I’ve got a surprise for you!”

“What kind of surprise?” Olivia’s curiosity was piqued, and she let Isabella lead her away.

Isabella just smiled mysteriously, guiding Olivia into the elevator and straight to the grand theater of their media empire.

As the doors opened, applause erupted in the room. Olivia was taken aback as her colleagues from the production team walked towards her, smiling and clapping.

She turned to Isabella, “Why didn’t you tell me about this? Look at me…”

She had just come from the hospital, still in her oversized mom outfit, no makeup, looking rather…comfortable. Was this really how she wanted to greet everyone?

Isabella gently hugged her and whispered in her ear, “Even if you were wearing a rag, you’d still be setting trends!”

Oh, for heaven’s sake!

This guy was just too much!

Olivia pushed Isabella away, pretending not to know him.

A shower of flower petals suddenly rained down on Olivia.

“Welcome home, Olivia!” someone shouted, followed by another shower over both Isabella and Olivia, as if they were being welcomed like a newlywed couple.

Someone called out with excitement, “Welcome home, Mr. CEO and Mrs. CEO!”

The crowd joined in with cheers and applause.

Isabella, usually so serious in front of his employees, had a grin that refused to leave his face.

Olivia’s face was flushed with embarrassment. Seeing Isabella not only let it happen but enjoy the chaos, she covered her face and groaned, “Stop it, you guys!”

Isabella cleared his throat, and the room quieted down. Olivia thought he’d finally put an end to the teasing, but instead, Isabella’s words left her stunned: “Out of everything these folks have said, this is the one thing they got right!”

Was this…a proposal?

Olivia covered her face again, feeling like she might faint from the embarrassment.

“Oh! Oh…” The crowd burst into laughter again, showering them with more flowers.

The commotion finally settled, and the group escorted Isabella and Olivia further in.

As Olivia, the future Mrs. CEO, mingled with everyone, she remained grounded and approachable. Having just become a mom, her warm smile was welcoming, and everyone wanted to talk to her, gradually pulling her away from Isabella.

“Olivia, guess what? Our ‘Send an Angel to Love You’ broke box office records again! Everyone says your love story with the CEO is both romantic and legendary!”

“And we’ve won so many awards with it, the latest being…”

Isabella watched as Olivia was swept away by the crowd, unable to hide his amusement.

Luckily, he had some business to attend to, which required him to step away for a bit. He figured he could let her enjoy the spotlight for now.

As Olivia was ushered into the hall, she barely had a moment to sit before fresh warm milk, freshly squeezed juice, and all sorts of snacks were brought to her.

Seeing everyone’s over-the-top enthusiasm, Olivia could only smile wryly.

Ever since they walked in, these people had been buzzing in her ears non-stop. Of course, many of them were old friends from the set whom she’d always gotten along with. However, some who used to eye her with jealousy now seemed eager to befriend her. Having Isabella’s children and his public acknowledgment changed everything—no one dared show her anything but kindness now.

Really, was she that kind of person?

They say having strong backing makes life easier, and it’s so true!

Reflecting on this, Olivia realized Isabella had disappeared again.

He left me here again, didn’t he?

Olivia sipped on her warm milk, taking her time.

Seeing she was a bit tired, the crowd finally gave her some breathing room. A few other mothers in the group started chatting with her about babies.

The topic of babies instantly energized Olivia. How much does your baby eat? How often do you feed them?

They were surprised at how knowledgeable she was about childcare, despite having a whole team of nannies and helpers. Her down-to-earth nature won her even more admiration.

Especially when they heard about how the great CEO himself helped with feeding and diaper changes, their envy was palpable. Talk about relationship goals!

Amidst the lively chatter, the hall’s speakers began playing a soothing tune, the theme song from “Send an Angel to Love You,” but with added electronic beats.

“Oh, it must be the game version of our new show!”

“I heard an IT genius crafted it, and no one’s played it yet!”

“Bet the CEO and his wife will try it out first!”

The excitement was palpable.

Olivia’s face turned red again, quickly correcting them, “I’m not Mrs. CEO yet, so stop calling me that! Just call me Olivia!”

Ugh, Isabella hadn’t proposed properly yet, leaving her so embarrassed. Hmph!

In her mind, a little version of herself paced impatiently, grumbling.

But the crowd wasn’t having it, teasingly insisting, “You’ll be Mrs. CEO soon enough, might as well get used to it!”

What nonsense!

Anyone who didn’t know better would think I’m pushing Isabella to propose. How embarrassing!

Just as she was stewing in her thoughts, someone called out, “The CEO’s here!”

Everyone parted to make way, standing on either side, greeting, “Hello, CEO!”

Isabella nodded slightly, though his face didn’t show much emotion.

Someone, quick on their feet, bowed to Olivia and called out, “Hello, Mrs. CEO!”

The smile on Isabella’s face widened instantly.

Taking the cue, everyone else joined in, “Hello, Mrs. CEO!”

Olivia was caught off guard, feeling a mix of emotions, and when Isabella finally sat beside her, she discreetly pinched him, whispering, “Is it really necessary for them to tease me like this?”

Isabella sat upright, but his hand held Olivia’s under the table, gently caressing it. “It’ll happen soon,” he murmured softly.

What does ‘soon’ mean?

Olivia wondered, her mind racing with possibilities, but too shy to ask for clarification.

The hall’s sound system played again, a gentle female voice announcing, “Our ‘Send an Angel to Love You’ game version launch ceremony is about to begin. All staff, please take your positions!”

So, today was the launch ceremony for the game version of their new show?

But…

Olivia glanced around, noting the setting—they were seated in the center of the hall, she in her mom outfit, with milk, juice, and snacks in front of them.

Uh… talk about a contrast!

Olivia whispered, “Should we have them clear these things away?”

Isabella gave her a sidelong glance, “What if you get hungry later?”

Olivia pouted, “I can’t eat this much; I’m not a pig!”

As soon as she said ‘pig,’ she clammed up, feeling unusually sensitive to the term lately.

Isabella laughed, “I aim to make you the world’s most beautiful pig!”

Oh, come on!

If it’s your reputation at stake, feel free to let it be!

Olivia huffed, grabbing a sticky rice cake from a nearby box and stuffing it into her mouth, chewing with exaggerated determination.

Isabella just chuckled, patting her head affectionately, “Good girl.”

Olivia swatted his hand away, “Go do what you’re supposed to! Isn’t this a launch? Why aren’t there any media here?”

Isabella raised an eyebrow, “Do I need to invite them?”

Olivia realized he was right. Anything happening at their billion-dollar empire would automatically draw the entire media’s attention. Who needed invitations?
