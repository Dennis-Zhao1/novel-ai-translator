Chapter 1: Misunderstandings Begin Again

"Hey, Isabella! Your eye's getting better?" Alexander asked as he strolled in, flashing a friendly smile.

Isabella just gave a non-committal grunt, clearly not in the mood.

Alexander, unfazed by her cold shoulder, adjusted his glasses and suggested, "How about we have the doctor check you again later? If you're good to go, I'll arrange for you to head back to your place. Olivia's been asking about you non-stop!"

Olivia Stewart. His tone was way too familiar for Isabella's liking. She's supposedly been visiting? Funny how Isabella hadn't seen her even once. Probably just an excuse to sneak around with Alexander!

With a palpable tension radiating from her, Isabella snapped, "Get lost!"

Even the ever-composed Alexander seemed taken aback, raising his voice slightly, "Isabella, watch your language! I'm your brother!"

Isabellaâ€™s lips twisted into a mocking smile, her voice barely a whisper, "Just a half-brother, do you even count?"

Alexander's expression darkened, and he turned on his heel and left.

With the truth out in the open, Isabella stopped pretending. She headed back to the main house to have the eye specialist check her vision. Learning it would take time to fully recover, she decided to return to her place.

"Isabella, you're back!" A tall, slender figure, Olivia, came running up to her, as cheerful as ever.

"Yeah," Isabella replied flatly, brushing past Olivia without a second glance.

Olivia stood there awkwardly with her arms out, but quickly recovered. Isabella's vision was still bad; he must have just missed seeing her!

With renewed enthusiasm, Olivia caught up and hugged Isabella from behind, resting her cheek against his back.

Isabella stiffened immediately.

"Isabella, I missed you so much!" Olivia said softly, snuggling closer.

But Isabella's mind was flooded with memories of overheard conversations, ones that cut deep. He pushed Olivia away, shouting, "Don't touch me!"

Stunned, Olivia stared at Isabella, tears welling up in her eyes, "Isabella, what's wrong with you?"

Frustrated and unable to articulate his feelings, Isabella stormed upstairs.

Olivia watched him go, biting her lip to keep from crying.

Lucas Wright, standing nearby, felt a pang of sympathy and tried to comfort her, "Olivia, maybe he's just stressed from all the treatment. Give him some space; he'll come around."

After a moment, Olivia nodded, "Yeah, I saw some calming herbs in the garden. I'll make him some tea!"

With that, Olivia hurried off, her tears barely held at bay.

Lucas sighed heavily. Since Isabella's treatment, he'd changed so much.

Upstairs, Isabella paced his room, the familiar surroundings doing nothing to ease his restlessness. Finally, unable to stay put any longer, he flung open the door, finding Lucas standing dutifully outside.

"Where's Olivia?" Isabella asked curtly.

"She went to the garden to pick some herbs. She thought they'd help calm you down," Lucas replied.

"Group Peterson has plenty of doctors; who needs her picking weeds?" Isabella scoffed, but he was already heading out.

Lucas followed him downstairs, watching as Isabella, despite his impaired vision, moved with determined strides. He decided not to follow further; if Isabella and Olivia needed to talk things out, his presence would only be in the way.

Isabella made his way toward the garden, scanning for Olivia. His vision was still blurry, making everything seem dreamlike and frustrating.

Turning a corner, he saw two figures entwined together. Alexander and Olivia!

He felt his blood freeze.

During his time of blindness, he'd heard the whispers and noises, but part of him had held onto doubt. Now, that doubt was shattered.

Clenching his fists, Isabella didn't confront them. With a dark look, he turned and walked away.

As soon as Isabella was gone, a servant hiding nearby rushed to tell Alexander. He quickly left with Sophie Cook, leaving the garden as if nothing had happened.

Lucas was still outside, praying for some peace, when he saw Isabella storming back.

"You're back already?" Lucas asked, surprised.

Isabella ignored him, heading upstairs and kicking over several vases along the way.

What on earth had happened to enrage him so?

Lucas wondered but didn't dare ask, waiting anxiously.

Shortly after, Olivia returned, panting and clutching a handful of herbs. Her pants were soaked with dew, and sweat glistened on her forehead.

Lucas hurried to her, "Olivia, you're back! The young master is furious."

Breathing heavily, Olivia asked, "What happened?"

"I don't know," Lucas admitted. "He went to find you, but he came back angry and locked himself in his room."

Olivia brushed her damp hair aside and handed the herbs to Lucas, "Take these to the kitchen. I'll go see him."

Still catching her breath, Olivia climbed the stairs and approached Isabella's room. Just as she was about to knock, the door swung open, revealing Isabella's stormy expression.

"Isabella..." she started.

"Where were you just now?" He demanded coldly.

Olivia felt a pang of hurt but answered patiently, "I was in the garden. Picking herbs for you, to help you relax."

Seeing you just makes me angrier, Isabella thought bitterly.

"Group Peterson has plenty of experts. Why do you need to pick herbs?" He retorted.

Olivia felt a sting of sadness. She tried to see his harsh words as concern.

Taking a deep breath, Olivia tried to explain, "It's a remedy from my hometown. It's harmless and worked wonders when I was a kid."

Isabella pressed his lips together, then slammed the door in her face.

Standing there, Olivia felt tears trickle down her cheeks. Isabella, what has happened to you?

In the following days, Isabella's coldness and suspicion were unrelenting. At first, Olivia endured it silently, but soon his constant questioning, even when she disappeared for just a few minutes, wore her down.

The breaking point came when Isabella threw away her medicine.

Olivia had been experimenting with it in her room when Isabella called her. She quickly pulled the curtain over her makeshift lab, hoping Isabella wouldn't see.

When the door opened, Isabella's face was already clouded with suspicion. "What took you so long?"

"Bathroom," Olivia replied dismissively.

Isabella glanced around, spotting the curtain moving slightly. Without a word, he yanked it open, revealing nothing but jars and bottles.

"Disappointed?" Olivia asked, her voice tinged with hurt.

Isabella stayed silent, his doubts confirmed.

Since witnessing Alexander and Olivia in the garden, a thorn had lodged in Isabella's throat, impossible to swallow or remove. He knew his behavior was hurtful and irrational but couldn't help himself. A demon inside him urged him on.

I need to see Professor Zhang, Isabella thought. Maybe my mental issues are worsening.

Unable to face Olivia's pained gaze, he turned and walked away.

Olivia stood there, tears streaming down her face. Isabella, how could you treat me like this? You're a jerk!

No matter how much she loved him, she couldn't stay with a man consumed by doubt and paranoia.

Packing her things, Olivia decided to confront the medical team at Group Peterson. Isabella's drastic change had to be linked to his treatment.

Making her way to the medical facility, Olivia spotted Isabella leaving through a side door. She avoided him, heading upstairs to find the eye specialist in charge of Isabella's care.

The specialist greeted her warmly and handed her a stack of documents. "He was just here for a check-up. His vision is fully restored. Here's the report."

"Thank you," Olivia said, glancing at the report. With only a year of medical knowledge, she couldn't grasp the technical details.

"Uh, I wanted to ask, could Isabella's mood swings be related to his medication?"

The specialist's expression turned serious. "Are you questioning my professional abilities?"

"I apologize," Olivia replied, meeting his gaze. "Isabella has changed so much. I need answers."

After a moment's hesitation, the specialist suggested, "He did see a psychologist occasionally. You might want to speak with Professor Zhang."

"Thank you."

With the address in hand, Olivia left the office, pondering if Isabella's paranoia stemmed from psychological issues. He must have been seeing the doctor in secret, not wanting anyone to know.

What kind of pressure was he under to develop such problems? What was the real cause?

Was she not supportive enough?

Lost in thought, Olivia didn't notice someone approaching until she bumped into them...
