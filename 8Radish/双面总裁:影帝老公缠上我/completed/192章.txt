Title: The Care of Master Isabella

“...”

Could this guy be any more shameless?

Isabella Peterson raised an eyebrow at the pouting Olivia Stewart, thinking, "Did I say anything inappropriate? No, I was just being honest!"

Fine!

Olivia decided to give in, handing a lump of clay to Isabella. "This time, let's make a little girl with pigtails wearing a princess dress, like the one I have. Can you do it?"

Isabella leaned in, his handsome face magnified before Olivia, exuding an intense aura. "Never underestimate your man. Otherwise..."

"Okay!" Olivia quickly backed down, knowing if she said another word, Isabella would go on and on proving his point.

That would be a nightmare!

They went back to crafting their clay figures. With their skills improved, they worked much faster this time.

Olivia shaped a little head that looked like a cute version of a bun, only with an innocent smile instead of a cool expression, and added two pigtails. Perfect!

She took the body Isabella had made, joining the parts together, and another adorable clay figure was born.

Olivia happily placed the two figures together. They looked like a perfect match!

"Yeah, I like this one!" Isabella commented first, "This one looks more like you!"

Olivia leaned against Isabella's chest, admiring the two cute figures, nodding in satisfaction. "I love them both!"

Isabella immediately wrapped an arm around her. "So, should we have twins?"

Olivia blushed, turning her eyes away. "Who said I want twins with you?"

Isabella scooped her up and headed out of the clay workshop. "Little one, never doubt my abilities!"

They walked towards the castle, their banter carrying on the night wind. "Isabella, you're so annoying! You promised not to sleep in my bed tonight!"

"Did I say I wanted to sleep in your bed? What I want to sleep with is you!"

"No way!"

"Otherwise, how will those twins you love so much come to be?"

...

That night, Isabella was dedicated to his grand twin plan, almost until dawn.

Olivia was exhausted and fell into a deep sleep, waking up only by the evening.

"Ugh..." Olivia lazily turned her head, avoiding the bright light.

Isabella's face was suddenly close to hers, startling Olivia. "Isabella, no more, I'm really...too tired!"

Isabella smirked, his eyes full of affection and mischief. "Little one, are you hungry?"

Olivia turned away, noticing the tray of food nearby. He was just bringing her something to eat, not... the other thing.

She was mortified, hiding her face in embarrassment. She pulled the blanket over her head, hiding her blushing face.

Isabella pulled her out of the covers, tapping her nose lightly. "Silly, how will you have twins if you suffocate yourself?"

Olivia felt a wave of exasperation.

Could they stop talking about twins already? Just thinking about it made her waist ache!

Isabella watched her embarrassed and frustrated expression with amusement. He picked her up, settling her in his lap, and opened the container of soup. With a long finger, he scooped up a spoonful and brought it to her lips. "Have some soup to warm your stomach. Careful, it's hot!"

Olivia's stomach was already rumbling after sleeping half the day. The aroma was irresistible, and she took a sip without waiting for it to cool.

The soup was a bit too hot, making her frown slightly as she swallowed.

Isabella's eyes softened with concern, but he teased her gently, "I warned you it was hot, why rush? I'm not going to steal it!"

Olivia shot him a weak glare. "It's all your fault!"

A rare look of sheepishness crossed Isabella's handsome face.

Alright, it was his fault.

After crafting clay figures together last night, they seemed closer, like an unseen gap was bridged. The tender Olivia was as tempting as a ripe peach, and he couldn't restrain himself, leaving her so worn out.

Isabella realized that doing something she loves with her brought more joy than offering her piles of money.

Looking at Olivia's even more charming face, Isabella suppressed his surging hormones, cooling the soup before offering it to her.

After finishing the nourishing soup, Isabella continued to feed her, awkwardly yet tenderly mixing each spoonful of rice and veggies just right.

When had the proud Isabella ever done such a thing?

Olivia's heart warmed, hiding the tears in her eyes as she focused on the meal.

Once her hunger was sated, Olivia felt rejuvenated, even if still physically drained.

As the staff cleared the tableware, Olivia noticed Isabella lingering by the bed, feeling a bit embarrassed. She turned away. "Was my eating really that bad?"

"Not very ladylike," Isabella replied honestly.

"..." She knew better than to ask!

Alright, she admitted she was a bit sensitive.

"But I like it!"

Huh?

Olivia perked up, her eyes lighting up with surprise.

"My woman can be herself, even if she eats like a pig, she's still beautiful!"

Isabella's tone was as arrogant as ever.

Olivia was speechless.

Was that a compliment or an insult? Could they even have a pleasant conversation?

Better to change the subject.

"Are you not busy today? You're back so early?"

"Yeah," Isabella murmured, glancing at Olivia.

Actually, he hadn't gone anywhere today. He planned to spend the weekend with her, but after overdoing it last night, she slept through the day. Maybe tomorrow!

Isabella wouldn't admit he cleared his schedule just to be with Olivia.

Olivia felt too lazy to move, resting against the pillows.

Isabella suddenly placed his hand gently on Olivia's stomach. "Do you think there might be twins in here already?"

"Pfft! What are you thinking? It's way too soon!" Olivia shyly brushed his hand away.

"So I need to keep trying!"

Seeing Isabella's serious expression, Olivia was flustered. "Again? Isabella, can't you take it easy? Aren't you afraid of, you know, overdoing it?"

Isabella raised an eyebrow, his expression playful. "Wanna try?"

"No, no! Isabella, I was wrong! Spare me!"

"You're overthinking it!" Isabella left it at that, his tone proud.

Seeing Olivia's distressed face, Isabella couldn't help but pinch her cheek. "Silly! Relax, I won't bother you today!" Otherwise, tomorrow would be ruined too!

Hearing this, Olivia relaxed, feeling like she had been granted a reprieve.

Gosh!

Was she getting conditioned by Isabella's teasing? Any hint from him made her think he'd devour her?

The next morning, Olivia woke up naturally, stretching luxuriously. She spotted Isabella in the wardrobe, assisted by staff, dressing in a casual light gray outfit.

Olivia felt a flutter of excitement. "Isabella, you're not working today?"

"Yeah. I'm checking out the market. Want to come?"

"Market research? Shopping? Of course, I want to go!" Olivia nodded eagerly, bouncing out of bed.

Usually, both were busy. If she was filming, Isabella was working. On rare days off, Isabella would be traveling. Despite being together for a while, they hadn't gone shopping together.

Olivia dashed into the wardrobe, picking a casual light pink outfit. Standing beside Isabella, they looked picture-perfect!

They got ready quickly and, after breakfast, hurried out.

Isabella surprisingly left his bodyguards behind and drove himself. To avoid unnecessary attention, they both wore dark sunglasses.

Olivia, who hadn't shopped in ages, was as excited as a bird set free.

Isabella watched her animated face, his eyes deepening.

True happiness wasn't about keeping her in a lavish castle like a princess. It was about experiencing life's vibrancy together!

Olivia hopped around, exploring everything, her arms full of little trinkets and snacks.

When her hands were full, she handed them to Isabella. "Hold these!"

Isabella frowned at the small items in his hand. "Why?"

"To carry them for me, of course!" Olivia stated matter-of-factly. "Haven't you seen couples do this? The guy carries stuff when shopping. Get it?"

Isabella glanced around. Olivia seemed right. But carrying these things down the street felt embarrassing.

Seeing him hesitate, Olivia pouted. "Fine, I'll carry them myself! Should've brought a bodyguard to carry stuff!"
