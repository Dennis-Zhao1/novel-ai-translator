Almost Dropped the Kid

Maybe guys just have a different way of showing they care about kids, right? 

Tommy was Olivia Stewart's first little boy, and maybe Isabella Peterson had high hopes for him, which was why he seemed so strict. But being strict and being indifferent are two totally different things, aren't they?

Olivia rubbed her temples, a mix of confusion and concern etched across her face. She had never faced such a dilemma before and had no idea how to handle it.

"Hey, Aunt Liv, don't frown! Frowning makes you look older!" Tommy, acting all grown-up, climbed onto Olivia's lap and used his chubby little fingers to massage her temples.

Olivia couldn't help but laugh. "You little rascal! You're such a sweetheart!"

The two of them joked their way back to the main castle where the family lived. Olivia had thought Tommy's introverted tendencies were improving, but as they got out of the car, she realized his lively, adorable side was reserved just for her.

The family SUV rolled to a stop by the massive fountain at the castle entrance. A bodyguard opened the car door for Olivia, ready to help Tommy out, but Tommy clung to Olivia's clothes, unwilling to move.

Olivia chuckled helplessly. "Looks like Tommy's still shy around new faces. Let me handle it."

She carefully lifted Tommy out of the car. Inside the castle, the staff, led by Lucas Wright, lined up on either side, bowing respectfully. "Hello, Miss Stewart! Hello, young master Tommy!"

Tommy, frightened by the formal greeting, hid behind Olivia, his little face tense with apprehension.

"Don't be scared, Tommy," Olivia reassured him, patting his head. She then turned to Lucas. "Mr. Wright, Tommy's a bit shy. Let's disperse the crowd."

"Of course, Miss Stewart." Lucas bowed and gestured for the staff to leave, leaving just two nannies holding Coco and Gigi nearby.

Olivia gently pulled Tommy out from behind her. "Look, Tommy, it's your little brother and sister! You're their big brother now."

Tommy hesitantly peeked out and his eyes lit up at the sight of the chubby, adorable twins.

"They're so cute!" Tommy exclaimed, staring at Coco and Gigi. "They look like a couple of little blessings!"

"Those big, bright eyes, like little shiny grapes!"

"Their cheeks are so chubby and pink; they look good enough to eat!"

Tommy was so taken with them that he stood on his tiptoes, reaching out to poke Coco's cheek.

The nanny quickly reminded him, "Young master Tommy, you haven't washed your hands yet. There are germs on your hands, so you can't touch young master Coco."

Tommy immediately retracted his hand, glancing nervously at Olivia.

Olivia shot the nanny a slightly annoyed look. Of course, hygiene is important, but come on, they're acting like they live in a bubble. Kids need to interact naturally, and now Tommy's retreating back into his shell.

"It's okay, you can touch your brother's face, just be careful not to poke his eyes," Olivia whispered encouragingly in Tommy's ear.

Tommy shook his head timidly but couldn't resist Coco's cuteness, his eyes showing a hint of eagerness.

Just then, Coco suddenly grinned at Tommy.

"Look, your brother's smiling at you! He must really like having you as his big brother!" Olivia encouraged again.

Tommy pursed his lips, mustering up the courage to reach out.

The nanny bent down, lowering Coco a bit.

Tommy's little finger quickly brushed against Coco's cheek, like a dragonfly skimming water.

Coco, thinking Tommy was playing with him, giggled out loud.

Encouraged, Tommy's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Can I hold him?"

"Sure, let me show you how. Make sure you hold him steady!" Olivia instructed.

Tommy extended his arms cautiously.

The nanny placed Coco in Tommy's arms, keeping her hands underneath just in case. After all, Tommy was only four or five, and holding a baby was risky!

Olivia was nervous but hopeful that the kids would bond happily.

Thankfully, Tommy held Coco securely. He cradled him with bent arms, concentrating so hard that little muscles popped up on his arms.

Tommy's face was serious, like he was holding a precious treasure.

Coco grinned toothlessly at Tommy, fascinated by his big brother's antics.

With great effort, Tommy brought his face close to Coco's, planting a gentle kiss on his chubby cheek.

"What are you doing?"

The sudden angry voice startled Tommy, and he almost dropped Coco.

Luckily, the nanny had her hands ready and caught Coco before anything happened.

Phew, close call!

Olivia's heart had leapt into her throat, but seeing Coco safe and sound in the nanny's arms, she breathed a sigh of relief.

"Who told you to hold him? You're too small to manage that! You almost dropped him, do you understand?" Isabella Peterson's handsome face was stormy as he scolded Tommy.

Tommy, already frightened and confused, quickly hid behind Olivia, clinging to her clothes.

Seeing this, Isabella Peterson grew even angrier, reaching to pull him out.

Olivia immediately blocked him. "Isabella, what are you doing? You've already scared him!"

Isabella's dark eyes glared at Olivia. "Didn't you see he almost dropped Coco?"

Olivia shot back, "If you hadn't startled him, he wouldn't have dropped Coco!"

"Olivia!" Isabella's eyes reddened with anger. "My son is not some toy for him!"

Olivia raised her voice, "Isabella, watch how you speak!"

Before things could escalate, Lucas signaled for the nannies to take Coco and Gigi out for a walk.

Seeing Tommy still glued to Olivia, Lucas put on a friendly smile, bending down and waving. "Young master Tommy, want to come see your room with me?"

Tommy shook his head vigorously, then suddenly ran out and hugged Isabella's leg, pounding it with his tiny fists. "You're a meanie! Stop picking on Aunt Liv, I'll fight you!"

Isabella's eyes blazed. "Get off!"

With a slight shift of his leg, Tommy tumbled back.

"Tommy!"

Olivia cried out, rushing over to help him up, her voice full of concern. "Are you okay, Tommy?"

Tommy nodded.

Olivia turned to Isabella, her eyes filled with anger. "Isabella, you just pushed a child!"

Isabella was momentarily taken aback. He hadn't expected such a light movement to send the little guy flying.

But seeing Olivia's protective stance, Isabella felt a surge of irritation. He raised an eyebrow, his voice cold. "When Coco almost fell, you weren't this worried."

Which eye of yours saw that I wasn't worried?

The nanny was right there, wasn't she?

"You're impossible!" Olivia spat, turning icy as she led Tommy upstairs.

Isabella stood there, exuding a frosty aura, his hands clenched tightly by his sides.

What was supposed to be a sweet, heartwarming family moment had quickly turned sour.

Olivia had hoped Tommy's cuteness would awaken some paternal instinct in Isabella, but reality was proving difficult. Ever since their first meeting, the father and son seemed locked in a silent feud, avoiding each other even at the dinner table.

Olivia was at her wit's end!

To make matters worse, Tommy had become incredibly clingy. He refused any help from the staff, wanting only Olivia's company.

He was like a little shadow, following Olivia everywhere. If she wasn't feeding him, he'd rather go hungry. If she wasn't bathing him, he'd just stand under the faucet, unmoving. If she wasn't tucking him in, he'd sit on the couch all night!

After a few days, Olivia was exhausted.

She barely had time for the twins.

And Isabella? Well, he was so annoyed that even their shared nights were disrupted, fueling his frustration!

In a fit of anger, Isabella left on a business trip, gone for a full two weeks.

Olivia felt a deep wave of frustration, unable to express her feelings.

She couldn't bear to neglect her twins, but she also couldn't watch Tommy's self-destructive behavior.

Olivia tried teaching Tommy basic self-care skills, but even simple tasks like brushing teeth or washing his face seemed beyond him, driving Olivia up the wall!

Once, she had just cleaned Tommy's hands and let him play in the garden for a bit. After a few minutes with one of the twins, Tommy returned with dirty hands, looking at her pleadingly.

Olivia sighed and took him to wash up again.

Later, a servant revealed that Tommy had deliberately dirtied his hands on the ground.

This kid...

Olivia realized Tommy had some psychological issues but worried that taking him to a therapist might upset him. So she made a discreet call for advice.

The psychologist explained that Tommy's behavior was a sign of extreme insecurity, leading him to cling excessively to those he trusted. He might even act out just to get attention.

After hanging up, Olivia let out a deep sigh.

Faced with such a father-son dynamic, what was she supposed to do?
