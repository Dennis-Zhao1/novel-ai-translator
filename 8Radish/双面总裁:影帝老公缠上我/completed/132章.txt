Title: Slaps & Sisters

Olivia Stewart dashed across the room, her heart pounding as she saw Sophie Cook crumpled on the floor. "Sophie!" she called out, quickly kneeling beside her friend.

Sophie winced, clutching her ankle. "Oh, my foot! It hurts so bad!"

"Don’t move!" Olivia instructed, carefully inspecting the swollen ankle. "It looks like you twisted it. Hang tight, I’m getting you to a hospital!"

As Olivia began to lift Sophie into her arms, her gaze fell on Sophie’s face. She froze, a gasp escaping her lips.

Sophie’s hand flew up to her face in alarm. "Why are you looking at me like that? Is it bad?"

"Don’t touch it!" Olivia gently stopped her. "Just a scratch, nothing serious."

"My face... is it ruined?" Sophie’s voice trembled, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Olivia held her hand tightly. "Don’t cry, Sophie. We have the best remedies at our place. You won't have a scar, I promise!"

"No! No—" Sophie wailed, covering her face, despair washing over her. For an actress, her face was everything. How could she go on now?

"Sophie, calm down. I promise we’ll fix this!" Olivia reassured her before calling in some help to get Sophie onto a chair. Then she called Lucas Wright, urging him to come with the best doctors and treatments.

Once that was settled, Olivia turned to Lisa, her expression icy and fierce.

Lisa shivered, stepping back defensively. "She fell on her own. You can’t blame me!"

Olivia stepped forward, her voice cold. "If you hadn’t twisted her wrist, she wouldn’t have fallen."

"It was self-defense!" Lisa protested weakly.

Olivia scoffed. "Please, you practically set yourself up for that slap. What’s wrong? Can’t keep up the act anymore?"

Lisa faltered, words escaping her.

"You wanted to slap me for the scene, fine. But you bullied my sister—unforgivable!"

Before Lisa could react, Olivia’s hand flew out, landing a stinging slap across Lisa’s cheek.

"Slap!" The sound echoed, Lisa’s face turning red with Olivia’s handprint.

Another slap followed, leaving Lisa’s face looking swollen and battered.

Olivia shook her stinging hand, casting a disdainful glance at Lisa. "That was for me. Don’t think your cheap tricks fool anyone. I tolerate you, but I’m not afraid of you."

Lisa, infuriated, yelled, "Olivia Stewart, don’t think being the lead makes you special! Without that role, you’re nothing! How can you compete with me?"

Olivia chuckled, "Compete? I don’t have to. Opportunities come to me without scheming, unlike someone who can’t get them no matter what they try."

Ignoring Lisa, Olivia turned to help Sophie out to the waiting car.

Little did Olivia know, her words to Lisa had not only hit their mark but also struck a nerve with Sophie.

As they drove to the hospital, Sophie sat quietly, a shadow crossing her eyes.

Soon, Lucas Wright arrived with a doctor in tow. They carefully moved Sophie to a van, and Olivia instructed, "Take us home!"

Lucas looked at Olivia’s face, aghast. "Olivia, what happened to your face?"

Olivia touched her cheek, realizing the sting from Lisa’s slap was still there. "Oh, just a scene gone too real."

"Well, ice it. And be careful next time," Lucas advised, handing her an ice pack.

He quietly ordered an investigation into the day’s events, reporting everything to Isabella Peterson.

The doctor quickly set Sophie’s dislocated ankle and treated the scratches on her face. Sophie seemed calmer after the treatment.

Olivia sat beside her, holding her hand. "Don’t worry. The medicine works wonders. I used it myself; my scars healed completely. You’ll be back to your beautiful self soon."

Sophie leaned into Olivia, murmuring, "Even if it doesn’t heal, I have no regrets."

Looking up at Olivia with clear eyes, Sophie declared, "You’ve always taken care of me. It’s my turn to protect you now."

Olivia hugged her tightly, teasing, "Silly girl."

Lucas watched the sisters, a heavy weight on his heart. As an experienced butler, he had seen too much. Olivia was too trusting, too kind. But Sophie—she was on another level entirely. If Sophie ever betrayed Olivia, it would cut deep.

Lost in thought, Lucas sighed as they arrived home. Olivia led the way, instructing Michael Wright, "Help Sophie inside. Her ankle is hurt, handle her gently."

"Yes!" Michael, who had never carried a girl before, blushed as he awkwardly picked up Sophie and hurried inside.

Lucas watched them go, troubled. "Olivia, are you sure this is wise? The young master said..."

"That was then," Olivia interrupted. "Sophie’s learned her lesson. Everyone deserves forgiveness."

"How about a separate apartment outside? With personal staff?"

"No need. Sophie stood up for me today. I can’t just leave her."

"Don’t worry about Isabella. I’ll handle it."

"Lucas, when I was hurt, you took great care of me. Do the same for Sophie, please."

Olivia bowed deeply to Lucas, who quickly helped her up, flustered.

"I’ll follow your orders, Olivia. No need to be so formal. I’m just a servant."

Olivia smiled warmly. "Lucas, I’ve always seen you as a kind, friendly neighbor, not just a butler."

Lucas’s eyes misted over. Sworn to serve the Petersons for generations, he was deeply moved by Olivia’s words.

From that moment on, Lucas vowed to protect Olivia as fiercely as he did the master.

For the next few days, Sophie stayed at their home, recovering. Though Isabella was away, Lucas ensured Sophie was well cared for, keeping her in a guesthouse far from the main estate.

Olivia visited Sophie daily, sharing stories from the film set and keeping her spirits high.

Two days later, news broke that Lisa had suffered a serious fall on another set, breaking her leg. With both the lead actor and Lisa out, production halted.

Olivia was glad for the break, spending more time with Sophie.

A week later, Sophie’s ankle healed, though her face bore faint scars, like tiny red worms.

One day, Olivia opened Sophie’s door, hearing a crash inside. She rushed in, stunned by the scene before her, her heart wrenching as she cried out, "Sophie!"
