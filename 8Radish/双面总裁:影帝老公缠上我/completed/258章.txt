"Olivia Stewart!"

The voice was gentle but brimming with unrestrained surprise and excitement. Olivia looked up, meeting the warm, jade-like smile of Alexander Peterson.

She quickly stepped back from Alexander's embrace, feeling a bit flustered. "Sorry about that!"

Alexander's face was full of amusement, with a hint of teasing. "What were you thinking about so deeply that you forgot to watch where you were going?"

"Oh, I was just here to…" Olivia hesitated for a moment before continuing, "I was here to find Isabella Peterson!"

Alexander's eyes flickered with a brief flash of cold jealousy, but it quickly disappeared as he put on a guilty expression. "Olivia, maybe you should head back. Isabella will be back soon!"

Olivia sensed something unusual and frowned. "What's going on?"

"Actually, Isabella just finished a check-up and left from here before you came. There's a garden out back."

"Thanks!"

Olivia thanked him and moved forward. She had seen Isabella leave through the side, but with Alexander here, she didn't want to ask Professor Zhang more questions.

Alexander caught up with her. "The garden's big. I'll help you look for Isabella."

"No need!"

Olivia politely declined and quickened her pace. She knew Isabella didn't have a habit of wandering around gardens. Looking for Isabella was just an excuse to get away from Alexander. But some people just couldn't take a hint!

Unable to shake Alexander off, Olivia maintained a two-step distance from him. Isabella had become suspicious and possessive enough lately; she didn't want to give him more reasons to overthink.

As Alexander mentioned, the garden was indeed vast. But it was mostly filled with greenery, flat terrain, and open views. Olivia immediately spotted Isabella standing beside a tea plant.

In front of Isabella stood a girl. The girl looked up at Isabella, her face full of smiles, her bright eyes filled with admiration.

Olivia stared at the girl's face, instinctively touching her own. What did she see? A face identical to hers! The girl's appearance, her figure, it was like looking at another version of herself!

Olivia blinked incredulously. No doubt about it, that was another her!

"What's going on?"

Olivia turned to glare at Alexander, her voice icy. Since he had brought her here to see this, there must be more to it.

Alexander adjusted his glasses. "Olivia, I'll admit, I'm selfish. I wanted you to see this. I want to break you and Isabella apart because—I still love you!"

Olivia closed her eyes briefly. "Alex, let's not dredge up the past. Haven't I got enough on my plate? If you deliberately set Isabella up with this girl to get back at me, then you've won!"

"Yes, I brought in this girl who looks like you," Alexander confessed. "But I didn't force Isabella to like her!"

"Hasn't Isabella been cold and suspicious towards you lately? The truth is, he doesn't love you! He loves the pure, innocent Olivia from five years ago. He's been holding a grudge about us, and this new emotional outlet has brought it all to the surface!"

"Enough!"

Olivia turned and ran. She couldn't deny that Alexander's words hit her where it hurt. Even knowing he was trying to drive a wedge between them, she couldn't remain unaffected.

Isabella returned to the cozy nook they called home a bit later. "Where have you been?" Olivia was now the one questioning him, her face cold.

Isabella looked a bit annoyed, his tone chilly. "Mind your own business!"

Olivia scoffed, then asked, "What's that girl's name?"

"Lily Smith," Isabella blurted out. Realizing his slip, his brows furrowed. "Olivia, have you been following me?"

"Just a coincidence. I'm not as idle as some people!"

Olivia's lips curled into a sarcastic smile as she looked at Isabella. "In a while, will there be a Jane Smith, a Kate Smith, a Mary Smith popping up in the garden too?"

Isabella exploded, raising his voice. "Olivia, what do you mean?"

"The literal meaning! Isabella, isn't it a bit sneaky of you? If you have a thing for someone, just say it, and I'll make room!"

Olivia's voice was cold as she turned to leave. Isabella stood behind her, his face dark, fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white.

This stubborn woman was too much! She'd been cozy with Alexander, yet he'd tolerated it. Now she threw a fit just because he spoke to another woman!

In truth, Isabella felt wronged. He had run into the woman who called herself Lily Smith by chance in the garden. Rather than chatting, he was shocked. Anyone would be upon seeing a doppelgänger of their partner!

Isabella wasn't one to explain. He didn't want to either. After their argument, they entered a silent treatment phase. Neither spoke to the other for several days.

Isabella spent his time holed up in the study, busy with work. Alexander had been taking advantage of his convalescence and the old man's hospitalization to hasten his takeover, and Isabella had to stay sharp.

Olivia, on the other hand, buried herself in her room, experimenting with various concoctions. She had planned to leave once Isabella's vision had fully recovered. But the past still lingered as a knot in his heart, and he had never truly believed her about the child. Before leaving, she had to uncover the truth!

Finally, Olivia found the drug Alexander had been giving Isabella and began experimenting with it mixed in milk. Suddenly, a loud crash came from outside, as if someone was wreaking havoc.

Who else dared to make such a ruckus at their place but Isabella? What was he up to now? Olivia rushed out, milk mixed with the drug in hand.

The hallway was a mess, and things kept flying out of Isabella's room. The maids stood cowering to one side.

Olivia was both shocked and angry. "What's going on? Which one of you upset him?"

The maids shrank back, shaking their heads. "It wasn't us! He started throwing things the moment he got back!"

So it was Isabella who'd lost it! Olivia seized the moment when nothing flew out of the room and marched over, shouting, "Isabella, what on earth are you doing?"

Inside, more crashes and bangs echoed. Minutes later, Isabella appeared at the door, towering over Olivia, his face stormy.

"Get out!" he spat, the single word as cold and painful as hailstones striking her head.

It felt like a punch to Olivia's chest, leaving her breathless. She opened her mouth, but bitterness choked her words.

Had he finally had enough? Was he finally driving her away? Olivia took a deep breath, turned, and left.

Isabella glanced down, spotting the glass of milk in Olivia's hand. He snatched it and smashed it onto the ground. "Crash!"

The sound was sharp, the glass shards mingling with milk as they scattered.

"Hey!" Olivia screamed, then grew angry. "Isabella, what are you doing? That was for my experiment! I found the drug, I—"

"Spare me your theatrics!" Isabella interrupted, shoving her aside roughly.

"What do you mean by that?" Olivia's chest heaved, and suddenly everything went black as she fainted backward.

When she awoke, Olivia's eyes fluttered open to a white ceiling. She looked around at the stark white surroundings. This wasn't Group Peterson!

Turning her head, she saw an IV bag hanging beside her, a cool, clear liquid dripping into her veins. So she was in a hospital.

"Olivia, you're awake?" Lucas Wright's kindly face appeared in her line of sight, full of concern.

Olivia couldn't help but look past him, seeking a familiar figure that wasn't there.

"Master had some urgent matters to attend to," Lucas explained hastily.

Sadness flickered in Olivia's eyes as she forced a smile. "Lucas, you don't have to cover for Isabella."

When a man wants to ignore you, the best excuse is a busy workload.

Seeing her spirits low, Lucas hesitated before speaking. "Olivia, try not to overthink things. The doctor says maintaining a calm, happy mood is best for the baby."

"The ba—Lucas, what did you say?" Olivia's eyes widened in shock, breath held.

Lucas rubbed his hands together. "Congratulations, Olivia, you're pregnant!"

This was news Isabella should have given her, but Lucas couldn't help himself. He had to say it.

Olivia was stunned for a full three minutes. Her pale face was unreadable, caught between joy and worry. Suddenly, she reached for the IV needle in her hand.

She couldn't risk medication now, not at this time!

Lucas quickly stopped her. "Don't worry, Olivia. The doctor confirmed these medications won't harm the baby. Just rest and take care of yourself."

Olivia relaxed, pondering before she asked, "Does Isabella know?"

"Uh... once Master finishes his work, I'll inform him."

Olivia's eyes bore into Lucas until he relented, admitting, "He knew when we brought you to the hospital."

But where was he now?
