Lucas Wright found himself in a whirlwind of emotions as he navigated the chaotic web of Olivia Stewart's life. It was late, and he was on a mission from Isabella Peterson, the kind of mission that made you question your life choices at 4 a.m.

Emma Thomas, with her sleepy eyes and casual demeanor, had just dropped a bombshell. "Olivia moved out ages ago. Her boyfriend's loaded, got her a big house, you know?" Emma yawned, stretching her arms like she was narrating a bedtime story rather than discussing Olivia's whereabouts. "Ethan King was out looking for her. Haven't heard back. Think she might be in trouble?"

Lucas's heart skipped a beat. He couldn't linger any longer. With a hurried apology to Emma, he dashed out, taking the stairs two at a time. Isabella was probably pacing like a caged lion by now, and her calls, relentless as they were, reminded him of the urgency at hand.

"Lucas!" Isabella's voice crackled through the phone like a storm. "Did you give Olivia her stuff? If you pocket it, I'll—"

"Miss Peterson," Lucas interjected, trying to sound calm and not at all like he was being threatened with bodily harm, "Olivia isn't back at the apartment. Ethan's looking for her too."

A short, incredulous laugh was Isabella’s only reply before she barked, "Then send someone to find her!"

Half an hour later, thanks to the Peterson Group's real estate prowess, they tracked Olivia to a nondescript hotel on the outskirts of town. Lucas felt like he'd been on a treasure hunt, only the treasure was a person, and instead of gold, he had a small box of sentimental value to deliver.

"Don't disturb her," Isabella instructed, her voice now a tired whisper before she collapsed into the blissful oblivion of sleep. Lucas stood guard outside Olivia's door, clutching the box like it was a lifeline.

Olivia woke up the next morning, her eyes puffy from last night's tears. She called her director to take a day off, only to find out that the leading actor, Ty Yi, had also taken the day off. She chuckled at the coincidence. But the laughter faded quickly, replaced by the weight of recent events.

With Isabella's dramatic "I don't need you" scenes replaying in her mind and her friendship with Ethan King strained to the breaking point, Olivia resolved to start over. She had to believe she could handle whatever life threw her way.

But first things first, she needed to make some money. Cash was tight, and while she had credit cards from Isabella and Ethan, she refused to use them. She would return them both. Olivia counted her remaining cash. Enough for the bus and a little extra for food, thanks to some savings in her Venmo account.

Determined, Olivia grabbed her sunglasses and backpack, ready to hit the subway stations to busk. She could have crafted and sold clay figurines, a safer and more profitable option, but that reminded her too much of happier times with Isabella. She wasn't ready to face those memories just yet.

As she opened the door, she nearly bumped into Lucas, who was standing like a statue outside. "Lucas!" she exclaimed, surprised to see him. "What are you doing here?"

"Miss Stewart," Lucas stammered, clearly chilled from his vigil, "I have something for you from Miss Peterson."

"Come inside, you must be freezing!" Olivia ushered him in, setting aside her own plans to help him warm up. She massaged his legs to get the circulation going, ignoring his protests about propriety. "Lucas, you've always taken care of me. Let me do this, okay?"

Lucas, blushing furiously, could only nod. He felt like a grandfather being cared for by his granddaughter. Once warmed up, he handed Olivia the box. "This is from Miss Peterson."

Inside was a string of wooden beads, old and polished smooth by time. They were her mother's. Olivia's eyes softened, and she felt a pang of sadness. Isabella had gone to such lengths to return this to her. Was he really so eager to cut her out of his life?

Lucas tried to explain how Isabella had searched high and low for the perfect box to match the beads, but Olivia wasn’t in the mood for sentimental stories. She took the beads, letting the box go back with Lucas. "I appreciate it, but please return the box to him."

Lucas sighed, understanding her stubbornness. "Olivia, you know how he is. He's used to getting his way, ever since he was a kid."

"Well, I'm not going to make it easy for him this time," Olivia replied firmly. "He let go first."

With a resigned nod, Lucas left, promising to help if she ever needed it. Olivia watched him leave, then quickly mailed back the credit cards to Isabella and Ethan. With her sunglasses on, she headed out, ready to face the world.

Meanwhile, back at the luxurious confines of their shared home, Isabella awoke to an empty bed. "Where's that rascal gone off to?" he muttered, half-asleep. "When she gets back, I'm gonna—"

Lucas entered cautiously, dodging a pillow Isabella tossed his way. "Sir, you're awake?"

"Where is she?" Isabella grumbled, already missing Olivia’s presence.
