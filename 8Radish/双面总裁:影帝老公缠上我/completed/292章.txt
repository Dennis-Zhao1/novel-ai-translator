Title: Screams from the Morgue

The morgue was colder than usual that day, and Olivia Stewart's scream echoed off the walls. Alexander Peterson's hand was missing! His wrist was bare, raw, and shocking.

"It's okay, just keep it cold to stop the bleeding," Alexander tried to reassure Olivia, forcing a smile despite the pain. Olivia was trembling, unable to look at the horrific sight.

"What happened to you?" she stammered.

Alexander chuckled weakly, "I got caught cheating at the casino. They cut it off. Simple as that."

Olivia's eyes widened in disbelief. "You went to a casino?"

Alexander smirked, "Where do you think all the fresh food you've been eating comes from? When the Peterson Group kicked me out, I was left with nothing. This place, I built it before..."

His voice trailed off as he lost consciousness.

Olivia was stunned. Alexander had risked so much for her. Her heart felt heavy with an indescribable mix of emotions. She couldn't leave him there to die, not after everything.

Ignoring the pain in her swollen belly, Olivia dragged herself over to Alexander and tried to pull him out. His body was heavy and unresponsive, making it incredibly difficult for her, especially in her condition.

As she struggled, she discovered a small door hidden behind some ice blocks. Was this the way out?

With renewed determination, Olivia pushed the door open. Outside, it was just as cold, but she could see a slope leading upwards.

She was exhausted, but she couldn't stop. She had to get Alexander out. For some reason, she felt a sense of obligation, a need to repay the debt she felt towards him.

Her efforts were slow and painful. Her belly ached fiercely, a sign that the baby was coming soon. She had to hurry.

Finally, they reached another door. Summoning all her strength, Olivia pushed it open and fell through, dragging Alexander with her.

What she saw next froze her blood. The warehouse was filled with rows of bodies wrapped in white sheets. This was a morgue!

A scream tore from her throat as she fainted, the shock too much to bear. Blood pooled beneath her as she lay unconscious.

Outside, people had gathered, curious about the noise. "Did you hear that? A scream from the morgue?"

"Could it be... a ghost?" someone whispered.

"No way! Let's check it out!"

Still, no one dared to enter. The place had a reputation for being haunted, and the rumors only added to their fear.

Meanwhile, Isabella Peterson, who had been searching for Olivia, heard the commotion. He suspected something was wrong and rushed to the scene.

With a swift kick, Isabella burst through the morgue doors. The cold air hit him, but he didn't hesitate. He scanned the room and spotted Olivia and Alexander in the corner.

Racing over, Isabella scooped Olivia into his arms, his hands trembling as he saw the blood.

"Olivia! Olivia!" he called desperately, but she didn't respond.

"Doctor! We need help!" Isabella shouted as he carried her out.

Everyone watched in shock as the scene unfolded. Some regretted not having the courage to enter earlier and help.

Inside, a few brave souls went in and found Alexander, bringing him out. But that was a story for another time.

In the emergency room, the doctor examined Olivia. "She's exhausted and in shock, but she'll be okay. However, her water broke early. If she doesn't wake up soon, we might need to perform a C-section."

Isabella held Olivia's hand tightly. "Do whatever it takes to save her," he said, his voice breaking.

Just then, Olivia's fingers twitched. Isabella leaned in closer. "Olivia? Olivia?"

Her eyelids fluttered open, and she whispered faintly, "No... C-section."

Isabella nodded quickly, "Okay, okay, no C-section. Just wake up, please."

He kissed her forehead, relief flooding through him as she slowly regained consciousness.

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as she saw Isabella. "Isabella..."

He held her close, comforting her. "I'm here, it's over now. Don't be afraid."

The doctor watched, a bit exasperated but understanding. They needed to focus on the baby now.

Isabella pulled back slightly, "The baby wants to come out. The doctor suggests a C-section, but it's up to you."

Olivia managed a small smile, "I've studied medicine. I know my body. If the baby's positioned right, I can do this."

The doctor checked her over again and agreed. "If she rests and regains her strength, she can have a natural birth."

Olivia looked at Isabella hopefully. "Trust me?"

He squeezed her hand, "I trust you."

Isabella stayed by Olivia's side, supporting her. "Rest now."

Olivia closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again. "What about Alexander?"

Isabella's expression hardened, "Don't worry about him. I'll handle it."

"Isabella, let him go this time," she pleaded.

He was surprised by her request but nodded. "You're too kind, but okay."

With a gentle smile, Isabella reassured Olivia. Together, they would face whatever came next.
