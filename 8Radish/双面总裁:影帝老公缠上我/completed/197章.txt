one morning, Olivia Stewart woke up in a luxurious hotel room, snuggled in Isabella Peterson's arms and wrapped in his suit jacket. As she rubbed her eyes and took in her surroundings, she mumbled, "Where am I?" 

"The Gold City Hotel," Isabella replied casually. 

"Oh, right," Olivia remembered. Lucas Wright had once mentioned that Isabella had a personal suite in every hotel of the Wright chain, and this one was no exception. 

"So, are we spending the night out then?" she asked, her cheeks immediately turning red. The question sounded a bit more suggestive than she intended. 

Isabella chuckled, "After dinner, we'll catch a movie. Then, it's your call—head home or crash at the hotel!" 

Olivia's embarrassment vanished, replaced by excitement. "Dinner first, of course!" she exclaimed, leaping up from the bed. In her haste, the suit jacket slipped off, revealing... 

"Ah!" Olivia quickly grabbed the jacket to cover herself, huffing at Isabella. "Couldn't even bring me a change of clothes?" 

Isabella grinned, handing her a neatly folded outfit. "I'd rather wait until you're awake to help you change, properly." 

Olivia snatched the clothes, her face flushed. "I'll do it myself, thank you!" She darted into the closet, slamming the door behind her. 

Watching her retreat, Isabella couldn't help but smile, his eyes twinkling like a sunny spring morning. 

When Olivia reemerged, a lavish dinner awaited them. Her eyes widened with delight—it was all her favorite foods! She eagerly reached for a golden shrimp, popping it into her mouth. 

The waiter, holding a towel, awkwardly stood aside until Isabella motioned for him to leave. 

Suddenly, the lights dimmed. "Whoa! Power outage?" Olivia wondered aloud, reaching for another shrimp. 

But just as quickly, the lights flickered back on. Relieved, Olivia grabbed another shrimp, savoring it. "These are delicious!" she exclaimed, her appetite fueled by their earlier activities. 

Across the table, Isabella poured a glass of wine, watching her with a mix of amusement and disbelief. "Looks like I haven't fed you enough," he teased. 

Caught in the act of licking her fingers, Olivia froze. When had she become so comfortable around Isabella, acting as if she were dining with an old friend? 

Famous for his fastidiousness, Isabella might not even touch his food now. Olivia glanced at him, gauging his reaction, but he simply watched her with an amused expression. 

"Sorry about that," Olivia said sheepishly, claiming the shrimp platter as her own. 

"Why so hungry?" Isabella asked nonchalantly. 

Olivia rolled her eyes, wiping her hands. "You tell me," she muttered, aware of the need to maintain some decorum. 

Isabella smirked, handing her a glass of wine. 

"Thanks," she said, setting it aside to focus on the food. 

Isabella raised his glass for a toast, but Olivia was too engrossed in her plate to notice, leaving him hanging. 

He sighed, lowering his glass. "I thought women complained about men lacking romance," he mused. 

Unaware, Olivia continued munching on shrimp, offering one to Isabella. 

Just as he leaned forward, she retracted the shrimp with a playful grin. "Oops, forgot I grabbed it," she said, popping it into her mouth. 

Isabella set his glass down with a thud. "Are you doing this on purpose?" he asked, feigning irritation. 

She blinked innocently, "You have your quirks. Sorry, I'll remember next time." Her gaze returned to the shrimp. 

With a mischievous smile, Isabella pulled the platter towards him. "I'm fine with sharing more than just food, you know." 

Olivia finally looked up, realizing the effort Isabella had put into the evening. "Wow, a candlelit dinner," she remarked, feeling a bit guilty. 

"Uh, sorry about earlier, Mr. Big Shot," she added, trying to smooth things over. "I was just really hungry." 

Isabella's facade cracked into a smile. He lifted his wine glass again, and Olivia quickly followed suit, clinking glasses with a soft "cheers." 

The evening unfolded beautifully, and they ended it with a cozy movie date, hand in hand. 

Back at their place, Olivia stretched contentedly. "Isabella, I had such a great time today!" 

Isabella gazed at her warmly, "I'll make sure every day is this wonderful for you." 

Lucas Wright approached with a small box. "Sir, Ms. Stewart, the figurines are ready." 

Olivia opened it to find four charming little figures: a proud Isabella, a smiling version of herself, a cool little kid, and a cute princess. 

"So adorable!" she exclaimed, reaching for them. 

Isabella gently stopped her. "Careful!" 

"But they're mine!" she protested. 

"Lucas, display them in the glass case," Isabella instructed, ignoring her protests. 

Olivia gaped. Was he really replacing priceless vases with their little figurines? 

Unbothered, Isabella took her hand. "If you're not too tired, I'd love to continue our evening." 

Lucas watched them ascend the stairs, smiling yet slightly worried. It was wonderful seeing Isabella happy, but he wondered how the family's patriarch would react to their public outings. 

Upstairs, Olivia emerged from the shower looking refreshed and radiant. Isabella's gaze lingered on her, tempted to draw her close again. 

"Enough!" Olivia chided, playfully swatting his hand away. 

Isabella grinned, whispering playfully, "I can't get enough of you." 

"Alright," she said, her tone turning serious. "Isabella, I have something to ask you."
