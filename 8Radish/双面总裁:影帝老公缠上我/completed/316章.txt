Alexander Peterson Returns

Olivia Stewart sat deep in thought, then asked, "What if we put up missing person flyers and offer a reward for any leads? We've got such a small team, and every day our little Tommy stays with Alexander Peterson, the danger just increases!"

Isabella Peterson paused, her face heavy with concern. "I've considered that too, but I'm afraid..."

"Afraid that Alexander Peterson might get provoked and act out?" Olivia Stewart finished the sentence Isabella couldn't bring herself to say, her hand trembling as she spoke. Her face turned pale with worry.

Isabella quickly hugged her. "It's just a possibility! We haven't taken that route yet, so don't worry too much!"

Olivia was desperate. "What if we let it slip that Tommy is actually Alexander Peterson's child? That way, he wouldn't dare harm him!"

Isabella's expression changed dramatically.

Olivia realized the implications immediately. If the news spread, everyone would know that Isabella had been wronged by her own brother!

"I'm sorry, Isabella," Olivia murmured, not daring to meet her eyes, her voice barely above a whisper.

Isabella sighed deeply, looking at Olivia with a complex mix of emotions. "If," he began, his voice strained, "if that could save Tommy and give you peace of mind, I'd do it. But with Alexander's suspicious nature, do you really think he'd believe it?"

"Not only would he not believe it, but he'd also hide even deeper and wouldn't even bother with a paternity test! He'd see it as a trap, a trick to lure him out!"

Olivia broke into a cold sweat, shaking her head vigorously. "No, don't do that! Let's just keep looking honestly!"

Isabella said no more, his gaze returning to the maps spread out before him.

His lips were tightly pressed, and his face was as cold as if a layer of frost had settled on it. The room fell silent, the atmosphere heavy and tense.

After a while, Olivia gathered her courage to speak again. "Honestly, I dismissed that idea as soon as I thought of it. Even if it wouldn’t endanger Tommy, I wouldn’t do it. I'll find another way!"

Isabella's cold expression softened slightly. He reached out, pulling Olivia close for a reassuring hug. "Don't worry, I'll do everything I can to find him!"

Isabella pulled up a map of the surrounding suburbs. "Look here," he said, "if you were Alexander Peterson, where would you hide?"

Olivia glanced at the map, noticing clusters of small black circles. She pointed to them. "What's this?"

"These are caves!" Isabella circled them in red, "A well-known tourist spot!"

A lightbulb went off in Olivia's mind, but her excitement dimmed. "But if it's a tourist spot, it’s not likely he’d hide there, right?"

"Not necessarily," Isabella mused. "Only a small part of the caves are developed for tourism. The rest is unexplored territory—plenty of room for someone to hide. But searching there would be difficult!"

Olivia and Isabella exchanged a knowing look, urgency rising. "Then we should send people to search there right away!"

"I already have," Isabella replied. "They're disguised as adventurers, checking out the cave entrances. But we haven't heard back. The cave system is intricate, and if we spook him, Alexander might escape, and we'd lose our chance."

Olivia's spirits fell again. "If only we had someone familiar with the caves."

"I'm working on tracking down the construction crew who first developed the tourist site. They'd know the caves well, and could guide us accurately."

Isabella finished, gently ruffling Olivia's hair, his tone heavy. "It's our best guess that Alexander might be hiding there. If he's not..."

Olivia nodded. "I understand. No matter what, I'll stay strong."

Isabella exhaled, relieved. "Alright, let's see what other places might be suspicious."

Their heads were close together over the map when the phone rang.

Before Isabella could reach for it, Olivia grabbed it eagerly. "Hello! Is there news about Tommy?"

The call was from the gate. "Olivia Stewart, Mr. White is here to see you..."

"Tell him I'm not available!" Olivia snapped, hanging up.

The invitation to Mr. White's business gala had been tossed aside by both Olivia and Isabella. Neither had attended, and yet here he was, persistent as ever.

With her child missing, Olivia had no patience for Mr. White's antics. "Didn't I tell the gate staff to turn away anyone from the White family? So frustrating!"

Isabella, however, frowned thoughtfully. "The White family deals in construction materials. Mr. White started in construction. He might know about those caves."

Olivia jumped up, her foot tapping impatiently. "Why didn't you mention this sooner? Let's get him back!"

As she reached for the phone, it rang again.

Olivia snatched it up. "Hello! Has Mr. White left?"

"No, he hasn't," the guard said, sounding troubled. "Mr. White insists on seeing you. He's at the gate, on his knees. We didn't know what to do..."

What was so important that Mr. White would kneel for a meeting?

Olivia frowned, but there was no time to ponder. "Let him in immediately!"

Soon enough, Mr. White was ushered into the castle, where Olivia and Isabella met him in the grand entrance hall.

Before Olivia could speak, Mr. White staggered to his knees, pleading, "Olivia, please, save your aunt!"

Though she wasn't fond of this so-called biological father, Olivia wasn't comfortable with him on his knees. She sidestepped and sat on the couch, her voice cold. "Stand up and talk."

Mr. White clumsily rose, wiping his tears, standing awkwardly to the side.

Seeing the gray strands in his hair, Olivia sighed and gestured to a couch. "Sit."

"Thank you, thank you!" Mr. White said, overwhelmed, perching nervously on the edge.

Olivia, seeing his cautious demeanor, turned away, not wanting to delve into it. "What do you need?"

"I, um, I need your help," Mr. White stammered, uncharacteristically hesitant.

Olivia was impatient. "Spit it out!"

She needed to resolve Mr. White's issue quickly so she could return to her search for Tommy. She had no time for his dithering.

"Alright, I'll say it," Mr. White said, rubbing his hands. "Your aunt is very ill with kidney disease. The doctor suggested early family testing for a transplant..."

"No way!"

Isabella cut in, his face darkening. He couldn't believe Mr. White wanted Olivia to donate a kidney for Grace Martin!

Isabella's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists, ready to throw the shameless old man out.

Mr. White looked pleadingly at Olivia, his knees buckling again.

This time, Olivia pretended not to see, making no move to stop him.

She looked at Mr. White, her voice icy with sarcasm. "If it's a family matter, why are you here? Am I her daughter?"

Mr. White's face turned beet red. "Just a blood test... In case White Miao Miao isn't a match..."

"What you're really thinking," Olivia interrupted, "is if I'm a match, White Miao Miao won't have to suffer, right?"

"That's not it. I just thought, more people, more chances!" Mr. White tried to explain, but he sounded unsure.

Olivia's smile was sharp. "Mr. White, do you have any sense? The odds of a match with a complete stranger are astronomically low. Do you think I'm that lucky?"

Mr. White's face flushed again, muttering, "The doctor said to test all the children..."

Olivia chuckled dryly. "I'm curious, why ask me to test when you know I'm not her child?"

Mr. White wiped sweat from his brow. "White Miao Miao already tested and wasn't a match."

"What about your son?"

"Oliver's has some matches, but his health..."

Olivia understood. White Miao Miao wasn't a match, but Oliver Phillips was. Yet Mr. White couldn't bear the thought of his son donating a kidney.

So he shamelessly sought out Olivia.

Once again, Mr. White had managed to lower Olivia's opinion of him.

Olivia smirked. "I'm amazed, Mr. White. When did you become so devoted to Grace Martin that you'd kneel before your own daughter?"

Mr. White didn't dare lie, admitting sheepishly, "Chloe Wright recently inherited a fortune, I'm sure you heard. I even sent invitations..."

Invitations that were ignored, leaving Mr. White embarrassed.

He paused, then continued...
