Title: Misunderstandings and Heartwarming Moments

---

Isabella Peterson slouched on the couch, feeling a bit grumpy. Wasn't it always said that women complained about their men being too busy with work? Today, he'd taken the time to be with her, and yet Olivia Stewart seemed eager to send him off to work. What was up with that? Could it be...

"Are you planning to meet up with some guy behind my back? Is it that Ethan King?" Isabella's voice was loaded with suspicion.

That had to be it! Ever since Olivia had dinner with Ethan King without telling Isabella, he'd cut off all contact between them. That smooth-talking guy couldn't even get through on the phone anymore! And yet, Olivia seemed to still be thinking about him.

As Isabella's temper started rising, Olivia quickly grabbed his arm. "You're overthinking it! I'm not meeting Ethan King. Since you don't like me seeing him, I won't. But this afternoon, I really do have some personal business."

"Personal business?" Isabella's voice shot up an octave, clearly triggered by the term. He glared at Olivia. Here he was, being the best boyfriend ever, and she was just shrugging him off!

Seeing that things were escalating, Olivia had no choice but to come clean. "It's like this: when I used to work at the fitness center, I'd volunteer at an orphanage on weekends or during my days off. There's this kid there, Tommy, with a congenital heart condition. He's kind of shy and doesn't open up easily."

Isabella's eyes narrowed at this revelation. Olivia paused, checking his reaction before continuing. "I've kept in touch with him, and he seems to trust me. I used to visit him weekly, but it's been months since I've gone..."

Isabella gently hugged Olivia. "Why didn't you tell me?"

"I didn't think it was a big deal to bother you with." Olivia whispered, silently adding to herself: Plus, you probably wouldn't have agreed.

"I'll go with you!" Isabella's deep voice resonated above her.

Surprised, Olivia looked up, only to be met with Isabella's perfectly angled jawline that made her heart race. "I mean, I can go alone. Really, it won't take long, and if you're worried, you can send a bodyguard with me."

"I said I'll go with you!" Isabella's tone had dropped several degrees, clearly still a bit miffed about the earlier misunderstanding.

"But, the orphanage isn't exactly a five-star place. It might be a bit rougher than you'd expect!" Olivia cautiously tried to deter him.

Isabella wrapped an arm around her waist, his expression challenging. "If you can go, why can't I? I'm definitely going!"

"Alright, alright."

They left together, and Olivia instructed Michael Wright to load the car with the stuff she'd bought that morning. Isabella realized then that all the snacks and toys were for the orphanage kids. Not for him. 

And suddenly, the young master wasn't so happy anymore. "What about me?"

"Huh?"

Olivia was too busy checking the items to catch his drift. When she finally looked up, Isabella was staring at her, looking like a kid denied candy. 

"Isabella, are you... jealous? They're just kids! What, do you like these little trinkets too? Here, you can have one!" Olivia teased, waving a rattle in front of him.

Isabella, still brooding, swatted her hand away. "I don't care for such junk. But I do care about your attitude! Olivia, have you thought about getting me anything while I was ditching billion-dollar deals to go shopping with you?"

A bit dramatic, but it was clear he was a walking contradiction. 

Olivia sighed, reaching into her pocket to pull out a tie clip. "I did see this tie clip that matched your tie, so I bought it. But..."

Before she could finish, Isabella snatched it, discarded his diamond-studded platinum clip, and replaced it with hers. 

Olivia couldn't help but notice how the inexpensive tie clip actually complemented his expensive tie. The colors and style matched perfectly, even if the materials didn't.

But still, she felt the need to point out to Isabella, lest he embarrass himself. "Isabella, this tie clip is really cheap."

"I know!" Isabella replied, looking both annoyed and determined.

"Then maybe you shouldn't wear it! I was just messing around when I bought it." Olivia's confidence wavered under Isabella's disapproving gaze, and she reached to remove the clip.

Isabella caught her wrist, letting it go with a stubborn, "I want to!"

Olivia's hand paused awkwardly, staring at him in confusion. He was both dismissive and unwilling to take it off—what was going on with him?

"Isabella, it's really low quality. You should take it off."

Isabella gave her a sideways glance. "Taking back a gift, Olivia? How embarrassing!"

Olivia opened her mouth to protest—it was just a tie clip! How was this embarrassing? 

Feeling a bit indignant, Olivia crossed her arms. "Fine, it's just a cheap piece. If you don't mind the embarrassment, wear it!"

"I don't care if it's embarrassing!" Isabella declared, all high and mighty. 

Honestly, Olivia found his attitude strangely heartwarming. If before she'd liked him for his looks, now it seemed he was finding his way into her heart and soul. 

If they ever had to part ways...

Olivia sighed inwardly and adjusted the clip on Isabella's tie. "It looks good."

Isabella smirked, "When do I ever not look good?"

As they arrived at the Angel's Haven Orphanage, Michael unloaded the bags from the car. Isabella was about to step out when Olivia stopped him. "Isabella, maybe you should wait in the car. I'll just be in and out."

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "What, am I not fit to be seen with you?"

He was in a suit, after all, and now she wasn't even letting him in? 

"That's not what I meant!" Olivia rolled her eyes. "Don't be so insecure."

"Who's insecure?"

"Okay, okay, wrong choice of words!" Olivia softened her tone. "I just mean the orphanage conditions might be worse than you'd expect. You have a thing about cleanliness, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable."

Hearing Olivia's concern, Isabella relaxed. "Then how do you manage? I'm coming with you! Besides, if you feel uncomfortable, I'll take you out immediately."

"I'm just worried about that!" Olivia sighed. "Isabella, the kids here are orphans. They lack material things but also affection. If you show any disdain, it could hurt their feelings."

So it wasn't about him, but about the kids' feelings.

Isabella looked at her thoughtfully.

Olivia's heart fluttered a bit. "Actually, I don't want to see you uncomfortable, either."

"I promise I won't look down on them," Isabella said firmly, stepping out of the car before she could protest.

Olivia forced a smile and led him through the orphanage gates. 

Isabella stepped inside and immediately paused, frowning—the floor was filthy.

But Olivia was too focused on the kids to notice his expression and went ahead.

"Sis Olivia! You're finally here, we missed you!" 

A group of kids rushed over, grabbing at her skirt and hugging her legs.

Isabella's face darkened, and he rushed over, pulling a couple of snotty-nosed kids away. How dare they touch his woman!

He battled with his disgust, trying not to gag.

Olivia turned just in time to see Isabella's grimace, feeling both touched and exasperated. "Isabella, maybe you should wait in the car. I told you it would be like this, but you insisted on coming!" 

And so, the day at the orphanage began, full of misunderstandings, small moments of jealousy, and unexpected warm fuzzies.
