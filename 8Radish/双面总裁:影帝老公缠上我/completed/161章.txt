"Never challenge me on who has more money!" Isabella Peterson declared with a smirk, her words cutting through the tense air like a knife.

Ethan King couldn't help but flinch at her words. The truth had never been more painful, and Isabella knew exactly where to hit him—right in the place that hurt the most. His face, usually charming and full of life, was now pale as a ghost.

Watching Ethan's reaction, Isabella felt a sense of satisfaction. "Oh, by the way," she added nonchalantly, "Olivia mentioned the other day that there's a cute assistant in their crew she thinks would be perfect for you."

Ethan had heard Olivia joke about this before, but now it felt like a dagger to his heart, twisting deeper with every word. His fists clenched so tightly that the fresh wounds from earlier bled anew, each drop falling like his shattered hopes.

"Please, just let Olivia go!" Ethan's voice was hoarse, filled with desperation. "I'll pay off her contract. I'll give you ten times the penalty fee!"

Isabella's laughter was icy, her smile mocking. "A hundred million!" Ethan pleaded, his voice cracking under the strain.

"One billion!" he shouted again, his voice now an echo of desperation and defiance.

But Isabella wasn't moved. Instead, she tapped Ethan's chest with her sunglasses, leaning in with a wicked grin. "Brother, never challenge me on who has more money."

Before Ethan could respond, Isabella hit the gas, her car speeding away like an arrow, leaving him standing there, bewildered and bleeding.

Ethan stood in the street, cars honking impatiently behind him, yet he was frozen, lost in a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. Why hadn't he realized his feelings for Olivia earlier? Was it too late now?

He finally shook himself out of his stupor, got into his car, and revved the engine. He had to find Olivia and tell her the truth; he wasn't confused anymore—he loved her. He needed to reach her before she got even more tangled in this mess.

Meanwhile, on the outskirts of the bustling film set, Olivia Stewart's car came to a halt. Her bodyguard, noticing the chaos ahead, quickly pulled into a quiet side street. "Olivia, something's going on at the set. Maybe we should call and check before going in?"

"Good idea," Olivia agreed, dialing her friend Sophie Cook.

"Sophie, what's happening at the set? It's packed with people out here!"

"Are you at the gate already? I'm coming to get you! You won't believe it—someone leaked the video of you and Ethan's kiss! Fans are going nuts, and the media's blaming you for it," Sophie explained, her voice barely audible over the commotion.

Olivia felt a cold sweat break over her. She hadn't expected things to spiral out of control like this. How had a simple kiss turned into such a scandal?

Her bodyguard glanced nervously at the crowd, "Olivia, maybe we should head back. Your sister was a bit loud on the phone—if people find us, I can’t guarantee your safety."

Olivia considered her options, hesitating over calling Isabella for help. Their last encounter had ended badly, and she wasn't sure if reaching out now was the right move.

Just then, her phone rang again, displaying the name Tianyi. She answered instinctively, "Hello?"

"Where are you?" a familiar voice demanded, filled with urgency.

"I'm near the set but haven't gone in yet," she replied.

"Stay put. I'll handle this," the voice instructed before the line went dead.

Olivia was left staring at her phone, confused. The commanding tone had reminded her of Isabella, but that was impossible, right? She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts.

Back at the car, Isabella, realizing she'd accidentally used Tianyi's phone, cursed under her breath. She needed to reach Olivia before things got any worse. But just as she was about to speed off, Amy Green blocked her path.

"Boss, wait! You need to change your look first," Amy insisted.

Isabella was impatient, but Amy's words made sense. Appearing as herself could worsen Olivia's situation. Reluctantly, Isabella agreed to a quick makeover.

In no time, Amy had transformed Isabella into Tianyi. With a quick change of clothes and a few cosmetic adjustments, Isabella was ready to face the chaos outside. "Hurry up!" Isabella urged, eager to reach Olivia.

"All set, boss. Just remember—you're Tianyi now. You'll handle this like the star you are," Amy reminded her.

Isabella nodded, determination gleaming in her eyes. No one would harm Olivia as long as she was around.
