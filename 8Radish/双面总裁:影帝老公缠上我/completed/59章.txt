The moment the itch powder hit Alissa's skin, she felt an unbearable itching sensation that made her leap off the ground. She twisted and turned, trying to scratch the unreachable spots, only to make it worse as the powder spread beneath her clothes.

From a distance, Olivia watched with a faint, amused smile. "Looks like the itch powder works way better than stinging nettles."

"Of course it does!" Lucas chimed in, clearly proud. "I got the strongest stuff available just for this!"

Olivia gave him a thumbs-up, "Lucas, I thought I was the only devious one. Who knew you still had it in you at your age?"

Lucas blushed, bowing slightly to Isabella and Olivia. "As the butler, it's my duty to handle women who overstep their bounds and dare to scheme against my employers!"

Isabella played with Olivia's fingers, her voice cold, "Lucas, give yourself a raise. Whatever amount you think is fair."

Lucas beamed, bowing again, "Thank you, ma'am!"

Olivia raised an eyebrow, "Why are you giving him a raise?"

"Because he's making my lady happy, and that's worth it! What, are you worried about the money? Sweetheart, trying to save your man's cash already?"

Isabella leaned over, planting a kiss on Olivia's cheek. "Lucas, pretend I never said that about the raise."

Lucas's smile froze.

"Isabella, that's not fair!" Olivia protested, lightly punching Isabella's chest.

"You were worried about the money, right?" Isabella teased, eyes sparkling.

"I wasn't!" Olivia waved her hands in mock despair.

"Then go ahead with the raise!" Isabella chuckled. "Relax, your guy can whip up a software and make enough money for a lifetime."

"Oh, come on. Software can't be that expensive!"

Isabella tapped Olivia's head playfully, "You think your man makes little apps? I develop management software for big companies, boosting efficiency and cutting costs. You can't buy that at a market stall. Plus, they need my team for updates and maintenance, so I've got them by the lifeline."

Olivia stared, wide-eyed.

"Impressive, right? You won't find another diamond like me."

"Better hold on tight and make it official," Isabella winked.

Olivia finally caught on, playfully pinching Isabella's side. "You're full of surprises, Isabella Peterson! Real estate mogulâ€™s son, IT genius... What else don't I know?"

Isabella grinned mysteriously, "You'll find out soon. It'll blow your mind!"

Under the shade, Olivia and Isabella chatted away, while Alissa, in her itchy predicament, floundered in the sun, trying to scratch the unreachable itch through her rough outfit. Every time she tried to unzip her clothing, a guard snapped a whip at her hand, forcing her to stop.

Alissa wished for a beating to distract from the itch. There was nothing around to rub against, and she soon resorted to rolling on the ground.

Olivia seemed to forget her, not signalling for the ordeal to end. Other staff watched from a distance, whispering to themselves about Olivia's hidden, ruthless side.

Two hours later, Alissa lay exhausted, resembling a muddy slug more than a person. Olivia ordered the guards to give her water and remove her jumpsuit, dousing her with cold water. Alissa welcomed the splash, scratching furiously at her skin, ignoring the blood stains she left behind.

Isabella laughed softly, poking Olivia's nose, "I thought you were being kind for a moment, but this follow-up was even harsher! Alissa's going to have scars for sure."

"Well, if I might get scars, she should have some to remember me by," Olivia said with a smirk, glancing at the observing staff. "People might call me ruthless, but I have my principles. Show me respect, and I'll return it tenfold. Cross me, and you'll pay the price. I'm not an easy target, and anyone eyeing my man will learn that."

Isabella chuckled, "That's my girl, fierce and fearless."

Olivia placed her hands on her hips, "I won't tolerate any more of these wannabes. They'll think twice before messing with me again."

Isabella laughed heartily, "You've got a knack for dealing with these situations!"

"Plenty of practice," Olivia admitted, before catching herself. "Oops, I mean..."

Isabella's expression darkened, "How many times have you dealt with this before?"

"Not much," Olivia said sheepishly, "I learned from a friend."

"What did he teach you?"

"Hey, it's your fault for attracting all these people," Olivia deflected, trying to regain her confidence.

"Olivia, don't change the subject!"

"Okay, okay... When I found out Daniel Johnson cheated with Emily Young, I slapped her, scratched her pretty badly. My friend helped me out, and we gave her a good scare."

Isabella's voice was low, "He helped you right away? Must have been interested in you."

Olivia laughed, "No way! He just hates cheaters and mistresses. That's all."

"Hmph," Isabella grunted, unconvinced.

"They disappeared for months after that, came back to get married. My friend convinced me to crash it, and well..."

Olivia glanced at Isabella, who raised an eyebrow, "So, should I thank him?"

"I wonder how he's doing now, being forced to marry when he doesn't even like women..."

"Olivia!" Isabella suddenly turned her face towards her, "Thinking about another man right in front of me?"

"I'm just being honest, Isabella. Can you say the same about your past?"

"No past to hide! It's always been you."

"And what about White?"

"Ugh!" Isabella groaned, "White is you! You're White! How many times do I have to say it? You didn't like that name, so I call you Olivia Stewart. And now you get jealous of yourself!"

Seeing Isabella's frustration, Olivia knew they were on different wavelengths.

Isabella calmed down, "Who's Daniel Johnson, your ex?"

"Yeah," Olivia nodded, "I know you can find him easily, but please don't."

"Even after he cheated, you still protect him? Olivia, come on!"

Olivia looked up at Isabella, earnest. "I don't want him to dirty your hands. It's like avoiding stepping in something nasty on the street."

Isabella sighed, shaking her head, but couldn't help a small smile.
