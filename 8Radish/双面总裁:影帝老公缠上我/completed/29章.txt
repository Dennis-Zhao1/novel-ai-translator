The living room went silent for a couple of seconds before everyone burst into laughter.

Isabella Peterson barely managed to cover her mouth before she spat out her drink. “Ugh—”

Olivia Stewart quickly helped her into the bathroom. Isabella bent over the sink like a shrimp, dry heaving and groaning. “Ugh—ugh—”

Outside, Olivia knocked on the door with a frown. “Isabella, are you okay in there?”

After a splash of water, Isabella emerged, pale and weak, with her dark eyes glaring at Olivia. “Remember, never ask a guy that question! Though, I’d gladly prove you wrong any time.”

Really, even now? Serves her right for feeling queasy!

Olivia rolled her eyes at Isabella. “Let’s go!”

She started to walk away but turned back with a warning. “Don’t be picky! I know you’re a neat freak, but acting like this really hurts Ethan’s self-esteem, you know?”

“It’s not like I have anything against him, but just thinking about it makes me want to—ugh—”

“Okay, okay, enough already!”

“You care about him?”

“He’s my best friend. Why wouldn’t I?”

“And I’m your boyfriend. How about considering my feelings?”

“You…”

“Forgot? You promised me a romantic night at the luxury hotel, remember?”

“…and a kid!”

“Isabella, can you stop bringing that up three times a day?”

He wasn’t treating her like just anyone, but instead kept bringing up their past, which made Olivia want to slap herself for ever mentioning it.

“When you make good on your promises, I’ll stop.”

“Isabella, I swear, your skin must be thicker than an elephant’s!”

“But I’d rather compare leg length with you.”

Olivia lost her cool instantly.

Back in the living room, Isabella looked at Ethan King with a straight face. “I’m not judging you; I just felt like throwing up.”

What a sharp-tongued guy!

“Isabella, can you just shut up for once?” Olivia yelled.

“Okay.”

Isabella plopped down on the sofa. The towel had already been replaced, and though he’d only dry heaved earlier, the housekeeper had cleaned the floor thoroughly.

Isabella sat on the couch, legs spread out, arms wide, looking completely at home.

The three others exchanged glances. Was he planning on staying?

Olivia approached him. “Isabella…”

“Tired? Have a seat!”

Isabella gestured casually.

“You’ve taken up the whole couch, where am I supposed to sit?”

Isabella nodded towards his lap. “Here!”

Olivia’s face turned beet red, and she yanked him. “Isabella, you shameless jerk! This is my house, my territory. Get up and leave!”

Isabella didn’t budge.

“Are you seriously thinking of staying here?”

“Bingo!” Isabella snapped his fingers with a smirk. “Babe, after hanging around me, you’ve gotten smarter!”

Olivia was taken aback. “Isabella, what are you saying?”

“What I’m saying is,” Isabella paused, his lips curling into a mischievous smile as he looked at Olivia’s angry yet adorable face, “I want to move in with you.”

“No way!”

“No way!”

Olivia and Ethan shouted in unison.

Emma, who hadn’t said a word, thought to herself that having this handsome guy move in could be a good thing. With Olivia and him together, Ethan might just become available for her.

Olivia crossed her arms, glaring at Isabella with fire in her eyes.

The well-known rich kid, Isabella, wanting to share her tiny apartment? What a joke!

Isabella, however, acted like he owned the place, casually tapping his fingers on the armrest, his dark eyes scanning the room with disdain. “Lucas Wright, this couch is too small, get a new one. That table’s dirty, replace it. That chair’s ugly, change it. And those curtains look like rags, take them down…”

Everywhere Isabella looked, he found something to criticize.

“If you hate everything so much, why stay?” Ethan said, standing nearby, enjoying the chance to get under Isabella’s skin.

“Oh, and you!” Isabella’s gaze landed on Ethan’s face again, making him feel queasy. “This room’s biggest trash is you!”

“I’m not trash!”

Ethan reflexively snapped back, realizing Isabella had tricked him.

Isabella turned to Olivia, dead serious. “See? He admits he’s not worth it. How can you share space with this loser?”

Olivia rubbed her temples, feeling a headache coming on. “Isabella, can you please stop causing trouble?”

“I’m not causing trouble. I’m dead serious!”

“Our apartment is full; there’s no room left.”

“I don’t mind sharing with you.”

“I do!”

“How about bunking with me?” Ethan looked at Isabella, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Isabella rushed to the bathroom again, “Ugh—”

It took him a while to return, pale-faced, pointing at Ethan. “Get this creep out of here!”

“Wait!”

Olivia stopped the guards, turning to Isabella. “This apartment was Ethan’s first. If you kick him out, you’ll have to kick me out too!”

She was learning to negotiate!

“I’ll kick you both out, but I’ll put him on the floor and you on the bed!”

With that, Isabella rolled up his sleeves, revealing a strong, toned arm.

“My bracelet!”

Olivia’s eagle eyes spotted a bracelet on Isabella’s wrist and shouted.

Isabella frowned slightly, glancing at the bracelet. It was something he’d taken from Olivia when he was drunk the other night and had forgotten to return.

The bracelet, with its delicate design, fit his wrist perfectly but was a bit loose on Olivia’s, making it look charming. Seeing her anxious face, a smile tugged at Isabella’s lips.

He casually adjusted his sleeve and tucked his hand, bracelet and all, into his pocket.

“Give it back!”

Olivia rushed to him, her voice breaking.

“Yours? How do you prove it? Did it respond when you called it?”

This jerk!

“Isabella, you took it from my wrist in the room! Stop being a thief!”

Isabella chuckled, his tone light. “Did I really?”

Olivia softened, pleading. “Isabella, please, give it back. It’s the only thing my mom left me.”

So the bracelet was that important? Interesting.

Without even glancing at her, Isabella checked his watch and arrogantly said, “Lucas Wright, since there’s no room here for us, let’s go!”

“There’s room!” Olivia nodded quickly. “I agree to you moving in!”

Isabella looked down his nose. “But you said there was no room. Are you agreeing to share?”

“I’ll…” Olivia bit her lip. “I’ll sleep on the sofa.”

“Olivia, take my room. I’ll sleep on the sofa.”

Ethan’s annoying voice chimed in again.

Emma piped up, “Or you can take my room, Ethan, and I’ll take the sofa?”

Ethan jumped at the suggestion. “Sounds great!”

“No way!” Olivia slapped him playfully. “How can you, a guy, let a girl give up her room?”

Ethan deflated. “Fine, I’ll take the sofa.”

The sofa was small and narrow, not comfortable for someone his size.

Olivia gave him an apologetic look. “Sorry, Ethan.”

Ethan beamed, feeling warm inside. “As long as you care, it’s worth it.”

Isabella cleared his throat loudly, interrupting. “So, is everything settled?”

“Yeah.”

Olivia ran over, smiling brightly. “Welcome, Mr. Peterson, your room’s over there!”

Isabella waved a hand. “Lucas Wright, get rid of everything in that room, even the wallpaper!”

“Yes, sir!”

Lucas went to work.

Olivia rolled her eyes. What a waste! Better to spend that money on a nice dinner for everyone!

“So…” Olivia tentatively asked Isabella, hopeful. “Can I have my bracelet back now?”

Isabella shrugged. “What’s that got to do with moving in?”

You’ve got to be kidding!

“Isabella, what do you want for the bracelet?”

Isabella lovingly touched the beads, his voice lazy and soft. “Anything in my possession is a part of me. If you want the bracelet, you have to want all of me.”

This guy was impossible!

Olivia bit her lip, steeling herself. “Isabella, I lost the bracelet when I borrowed a kiss from you. Today, I’ll return the favor. Will you give it back then?”

Was she serious?

Isabella raised an eyebrow, his eyes locked on her lips, saying nothing.

Olivia turned to Emma and Ethan. “You two, turn around!”

“Olivia…”

“Turn around!”

Ethan turned away, feeling a pang of heartache.

Olivia took a deep breath, approached Isabella, and suddenly pushed him onto the sofa, sprawling into his arms. Isabella naturally wrapped his arms around her waist…
