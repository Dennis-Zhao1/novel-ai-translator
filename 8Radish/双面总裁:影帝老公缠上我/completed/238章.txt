Chapter Title: Sisterly Rift

Sophie Cook barely dodged the blow, her heart pounding in her chest. She never imagined that Tianyi could be as ruthless as Isabella Peterson. Standing there awkwardly, she dared not beg for mercy.

Tianyi, however, couldn’t care less about Sophie’s fate. He tossed his laptop aside and hurried toward Olivia Stewart. Olivia sat quietly, her expression calm and detached, as if nothing around her mattered.

"Olivia!" Tianyi called out hoarsely, wrapping her in his arms. Only then did he realize how cold and stiff she felt. Panic gripped him as he gently nuzzled her hair. "Olivia, are you okay?"

He seemed to forget that he was an award-winning actor, and the woman he held was the girlfriend of his own boss.

Olivia, comforted by the familiar warmth and scent, took a deep breath before gently pushing Tianyi away. "Thank you, I’m fine," she said.

Tianyi frowned. Her face was scrunched up in distress. How could she say she was fine? Anyone would be upset if their own sister turned against them like that.

Ignoring her protests, Tianyi pulled Olivia back into his embrace. "You’re allowed to cry for a bit," he murmured.

Olivia’s muffled voice emerged from his chest. "Make them leave. My sister is my responsibility."

Even now, she refused to see the truth? Tianyi’s eyes darkened. He hadn’t intended to reveal everything, but it seemed drastic measures were needed.

Gently patting Olivia’s back, Tianyi released her and stepped up to the podium. He picked up the microphone and announced, "On behalf of Billion Film Studios, I hereby expel Sophie Cook permanently! This press conference is over!"

Security quickly cleared the room, leaving only Tianyi, Sophie, and Olivia in the empty hall. Sophie assumed Olivia’s heart had softened once more and dragged out her plea with a whine, "Sis—"

Olivia approached Sophie slowly, her steps heavy. She stopped in front of her wayward sister. "Don’t call me that. You’re not worthy."

Her voice was eerily calm.

"Sis, I was forced!" Sophie cried, reaching out to grab Olivia’s hand, only for Olivia to recoil in disgust.

"Save your tears. They won’t work anymore."

Seeing Olivia unmoved, Sophie wiped the makeup from her face, revealing a grotesque scar. "Sis, please forgive me this once. Remember, I got this scar saving you!"

"You got what you deserved," Tianyi interjected, thrusting a thick file into Olivia’s hands. "Look at what Sophie’s done to you, how many times she’s hurt you."

Olivia didn’t take the file, her eyes fixed on Sophie. "Explain yourself."

Sophie remained silent, resolved to deny everything. "Sis, I’ve made mistakes before, but I’ve changed. For Mom’s sake, and because of my face, please forgive me."

A bitter smile crossed Olivia’s lips. "Sophie, you always knew how to hit my weak spots. Because of Mom’s will, I sacrificed everything for you. I even dated Isabella to earn money for your entertainment career. But you? You came into my home and betrayed me without hesitation."

"I felt guilty about your scar, so I never complained, always thinking of you. I even took the blame for those photos. And yet, you went further, making those videos!"

"Now I see it. Your 'rescue' was just an act that went too far, and you accidentally hurt yourself, right?"

Sophie blanched, caught in the truth. Under Olivia’s piercing gaze, her bravado crumbled.

"Sophie," Olivia said, her voice breaking, "I’m not a fool—I just wanted to give you a chance to change."

"Because you’re my sister, my only family in this world!"

Her eyes welled with tears, which she fought to hold back. "But what else have you done? Tell me!"

Her voice suddenly rose, startling Sophie. She hung her head even lower.

Tianyi, unable to watch, moved to retrieve the file, but Olivia snatched it away. She flipped through the pages quickly, each revelation hitting her like a punch.

The old incidents she’d tried to ignore or forget resurfaced, and seeing the evidence before her was more painful than she could have imagined. In minutes, Olivia felt as if she’d walked through hell.

The crushing disappointment was like being doused with ice water in the dead of winter, chilling her to the bone. She looked at Sophie, her eyes dull and lifeless.

"To think you started plotting against me so early!"

"How ironic that I gave you the chance to escape when we were attacked in that alley!"

"Do you know how much courage it takes to face thugs alone?"

"You let them violate your sister!" Olivia accused, her voice breaking. "Is your conscience gone?"

"Did you really want me to be assaulted?"

Faced with Olivia’s accusations, Sophie was at a loss for words.

A sharp slap echoed in the hall, leaving red marks on Sophie’s face, which quickly swelled. The scars on her face made her look even more grotesque, like her soul.

"Why?" Olivia demanded, her voice hoarse with sorrow. "I sacrificed everything for you. Why do this to me?"

Her voice was raw with a deep sense of betrayal.

"Don’t make yourself out to be some martyr," Sophie sneered suddenly. "Did you really sacrifice everything?"

"Then why didn’t you give me Isabella Peterson?"

"Why didn’t you give me the lead role?"

"Why didn’t you give me Tianyi?"

"Olivia, you’re just a tainted woman. Why should everything be yours? Why?"

"I’m prettier, I’m slimmer, what do I lack? Why do all the successful men flock to you?"

"If you hadn’t taken that lead role, everything would have been mine!"

Jealousy, like a serpent, gnawed at Sophie’s heart, driving her mad with envy.

Olivia sighed deeply. "Believe it or not, I never intended to take the lead role from you."

"The man who tainted me was Isabella Peterson."

"But I was hypnotized to forget. He filmed that scene to help me recover my memory."

"The lead role, whether I wanted it or not, was always going to be mine."

"Because it was tailored for me by Isabella Peterson."

Rage and jealousy burned in Sophie’s eyes. She had fallen into Henry Adams’ trap, chasing that lead role, and been violated, setting her on a path of no return. Yet Olivia could dismiss it as "tailor-made" and take everything from her. Why?

Seeing Sophie consumed by envy, Olivia felt no satisfaction, only a deep sense of loss and resignation.

"And as for Isabella Peterson and Tianyi, they are their own people. Whether they like you or not is up to them, not something to be given."

"If Isabella had chosen you, I would have turned away without a second thought."

"Because back then, you were still my beloved sister, and even if it hurt, I would have given him to you."

"If now Isabella chose you, I would still walk away. But not to give him to you, because such a man would no longer be worth my time."

Tianyi, listening from the side, gazed at Olivia, his eyes filled with a deep affection. His woman was truly extraordinary.

But then, Olivia did something that surprised him—she ordered the bodyguards holding Sophie, "Let her go."

The guards looked to Tianyi for confirmation. His handsome face turned icy, and he frowned at Olivia. "Are you crazy?"

"It’s none of your business! Let her go!" she insisted.

This infuriating woman! Tianyi wanted to crack her head open to see if it was filled with sawdust.

Reluctantly, Tianyi signaled the guards to release Sophie.

Sophie stretched her sore limbs and looked at Olivia with cold arrogance. "Don’t think I’ll thank you!"

With their relationship beyond repair, there was no need for pretense.

"I don’t expect your gratitude. From now on, your life is your own. Whether you live or die, it has nothing to do with me."

Olivia’s voice was steady, her gaze unflinching. It was clear her heart had been hardened by the hurt.

Sophie smirked, her scarred face twisted with malice. "Olivia, you swore at Mom’s grave that if I suffered, you’d suffer too!"

Again with the guilt trip involving Mom! Olivia’s face darkened with an icy rage.

"My sister is dead. Now leave!"

Letting Sophie disappear from her life was Olivia’s final concession, an attempt to honor her mother’s wishes.

Sophie, seeing Olivia’s resolute demeanor, didn’t dare linger. She turned and ran, her steps hurried and unsteady, as if afraid Olivia might change her mind.

Olivia stood there, her heart aching. After a long moment, a lone tear slid down her cheek.

Tianyi handed her a tissue. "She’s not worth it."

Olivia swatted his hand away forcefully...
