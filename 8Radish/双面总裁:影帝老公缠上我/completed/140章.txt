Isabella Peterson dashed over like a superhero, scooping Olivia Stewart out from the pile of what looked like a ring of mini-mountains. Olivia nestled comfortably against Isabella's warm, sturdy chest, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. Her big, bright eyes sparkled with amusement as she blinked playfully.

She knew it—Isabella cared about her. Not a single one of those things had landed on her!

After rescuing Olivia, Isabella gently tossed her onto the nearby couch. Although the move seemed rough, it was actually executed with care, ensuring Olivia's injured back was well-protected.

"Isabella..." Olivia clung to Isabella's arm, her face rubbing against it like a playful kitten.

Isabella froze. This was unusual. Olivia rarely initiated such sweet gestures. Her innocent charm mixed with a hint of allure was almost...

Isabella's eyes flashed with a wolf-like glint, and he quickly withdrew his arm, clearing his throat to scold, "Sit still! Don't think acting cute will save you from a lecture!"

Olivia pouted, turning her face away with a huff. Right now, Isabella seemed more like a toothless tiger—fierce in appearance, but hardly frightening at all.

Watching Olivia's defiant pose, Isabella's expression turned sour. Annoying little thing! He spun around, reaching habitually for the phone on his desk, only to find it missing. His phone—gone too!

Only then did Isabella remember he'd hurled everything off the desk in a fit of rage. Yet Olivia had laughed throughout the whole ordeal! This crafty girl—she was too clever by half. He couldn't bring himself to truly punish her. Glancing at the mess on the floor, Isabella's mood soured further. Being outsmarted by a young girl—it was maddening!

With a thud, Isabella plopped back into his chair, his face as sour as if he'd swallowed a bug. Lucas Wright, ever observant, emerged from the corner, rummaging through the debris to retrieve Isabella's phone. He wiped it clean with his butler's uniform and a nearby towel before timidly handing it to Isabella.

Isabella glanced at Lucas, then at Olivia, who sat primly on the couch, and commanded, "Get out!"

Lucas wisely began cleaning up the mess. Olivia, however, cheerfully bounded toward the door, thinking Isabella’s outburst was over. But just as she reached the exit, Isabella's chilling voice stopped her cold: "Michael Wright, get over here!"

Olivia's heart sank, her steps halting immediately. How could she have forgotten? Her back was injured by Sophie Cook, yet Isabella hadn't said a word about it. If she was feeling disoriented from his yelling, what would happen to Sophie?

Rushing back, Olivia stood in front of Isabella, her wide eyes staring him down. "Why are you calling Michael Wright?"

Isabella's gaze turned cold as he tossed his phone back onto the desk, crossing his legs. "Since when do you question my actions?"

Olivia fumed silently. This jerk! Even though she was standing and he was sitting, his presence was overwhelmingly intimidating. A mere glance from Isabella and Olivia felt herself shrinking.

But no! She couldn't back down. Clenching her fists, she met Isabella's gaze bravely and demanded, "You're planning something against Sophie Cook, aren't you?"

Isabella's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Someone who dares to harm my woman—do you think I'd just let them be?"

"She's not just anyone! She's my sister!"

Isabella's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Not much of a sister, is she?"

Olivia's face flushed with frustration as she stomped her foot. "Sophie might have hurt me, but I don't blame her! This is between us! It's up to me to decide if I forgive her!"

Isabella suddenly rose, gripping Olivia's chin firmly as he loomed over her. His eyes blazed with icy intensity. "Say that again!"

"I-I..." Olivia stammered, her gaze darting nervously. "Sophie is my sister, and I won't let you hurt her!"

"And you'll let her hurt you? Idiot!"

Isabella released her with a scornful flick, his eyes filled with cold fury and deep disappointment. He pointed to the door. "Out!"

Tears welled up in Olivia’s eyes, spilling down her cheeks. She felt so wronged. She had missed Isabella so much, and now that he was back, all he did was yell and call her names!

"Stop crying!" Isabella barked, frustrated.

Olivia's sobs only grew louder. "You’re such a jerk, Isabella! I hate you! I really, really hate you..."

Her sudden outburst left Isabella bewildered, his stern demeanor crumbling. "I wasn't yelling at you! I just... spoke a bit loudly!"

Olivia sniffled, stomping her foot in protest. "You did yell! And you called me an idiot!"

"Well, aren't you?" Isabella regretted it the moment he said it, awkwardly coughing to cover up. "Ahem! I'll phrase it differently next time."

"…"

"Dummy!"

"Waaah..."

Olivia's wails intensified, expressing her grievance in full force. Watching her favorite drama, she always thought those crying heroines were over the top. Now, in front of Isabella, she found it oddly satisfying.

Especially seeing him look so helpless and lost!

Isabella sighed deeply, his hand clenching and unclenching by his side. This girl, where did she get all these tears?

Initially, Olivia intended to vent her frustrations through tears, but the more she cried, the more wronged she felt. It spiraled into an uncontrollable sob, leaving her gasping for air.

This silly girl! Enough with the crying!

Isabella wanted to shout, but he knew it would only make things worse. Instead, he lifted his hand, initially wanting to pull her over his knee and spank some sense into her. "Enough of this! Stop crying!"

But halfway through, Isabella softened, gently patting Olivia's head before pulling her into a comforting embrace. "Alright, alright. No more tears. I won't call you names again, okay?"

Olivia peeked up, her cheeks puffed with indignation. "If you do, you're the idiot!"

Isabella's eyebrows shot up. "Cheeky little thing, daring to insult me! You're getting bold, huh?"

"You called me names first! We're even now!"

Olivia wriggled free from his arms, quickly hopping away. She knew when to retreat—pushing further would be too much.

Isabella tossed her a box of tissues, casting a disdainful glance. "You're a mess! Go clean yourself up."

Embarrassed, Olivia dabbed at her face with tissues. She'd seen women cry before—a snotty, teary mess was never flattering!

A knock at the door startled them both. Michael Wright stood there, expressionless, as if he hadn't just witnessed Olivia's entire outburst.

Oh, great!

Feeling mortified, Olivia was about to make a hasty exit when she remembered why Isabella had called Michael. Turning back, she faced Isabella with big, pleading eyes. "Isabella, could you let my sister off the hook?"

Her expression clearly said, "Refuse me, and I'll cry again."

Isabella snapped back to reality, furious. "Olivia! You dare use this against me again?"

He spun around, kicking over a chair in frustration. "Crying like that, all an act! For that sister who keeps causing you trouble, you'd put on a show for me!"

"You think crying will make me forgive her? Dream on!"

Isabella ranted, nearly kicking Olivia in his frenzy. But instead of fleeing, Olivia ran to him, wrapping him in a tight hug.

Isabella stood there, his eyes reddening with emotion. "Let go!"

"I won't!"

Olivia clung stubbornly, rising on her toes to hold him tighter. "I wasn't acting, Isabella. I wasn't lying! When you yelled and scolded me, I genuinely felt hurt!"

Isabella's face softened ever so slightly. "You deserved it."

"Yes, maybe. But I know you care about me, Isabella. Please, can't you spare Sophie? She's changed, really! This was all just a misunderstanding!"

Isabella remained silent, his lips pressed into a thin, unyielding line. A misunderstanding? Only someone truly naive would believe that!
