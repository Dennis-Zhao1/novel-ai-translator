As the helicopter descended, the scene below was chaotic. Olivia Stewart was in a precarious situation, accused of forcing her sister, Sophie Cook, into a scandal that led Sophie to attempt suicide. The crowd was frenzied, fueled by the sensational claims of an overzealous reporter who spotted Olivia near Sophie on the balcony.

"Look! There she is, right behind Sophie Cook! She's trying to push Sophie off!" the reporter shouted, setting the crowd into a frenzy.

Olivia was seething. Her intention was to pull Sophie back to safety, not push her off. But the reporter's words had ignited the crowd's imagination, painting her as the villain in this tragic story.

"Sophie!" Olivia called out, her voice a mix of desperation and anger. "Listen to me! I would never push you! I just wanted to bring you back from the edge. Please, it's too dangerous up there!"

Sophie, standing at the balcony's edge, was unconvinced. "No, I won’t! I've lost everything already!" she cried, her grip loosening as despair overcame her.

"Sophie, please!" Olivia pleaded. "Those photos have nothing to do with you!"

Sophie hesitated, her hand pausing mid-air. "Do you even know what you're saying, Olivia?"

"Yes, Sophie! The photos were from my hacked computer. They have nothing to do with you! Please come down!"

The admission caused an uproar. The crowd erupted with insults as more salacious stories about Olivia's nightlife were spread online. Photos from her past, originally taken during wild nights out with friends, were now used against her, cementing her tarnished reputation.

Sophie, seeing the situation shift, tried to step back inside but lost her balance. Her foot slipped, and she began to fall.

"Sophie!" Olivia screamed, lunging forward but only managing to grab Sophie's shoe as she fell.

The crowd below gasped as Sophie plummeted from the third floor. Fortunately, the dense crowd cushioned her fall, leaving her battered but alive. She was quickly rushed to the hospital for emergency care.

Olivia, meanwhile, became the focus of the crowd's ire. They hurled insults, calling her every name imaginable, demanding she come down and face the consequences.

Amidst the chaos, a familiar voice boomed from above, cutting through the noise like a clap of thunder. "You dare!"

Olivia's heart skipped a beat. It was Isabella Peterson, her long-time confidant and, unbeknownst to many, a powerful figure in the entertainment world. Isabella descended from the helicopter, looking every bit the part of a superhero, with a commanding presence that silenced the crowd.

"Olivia Stewart, you fool!" Isabella's voice echoed as she swung down on a rope ladder. "If you jump, I swear I'll piece you back together like a jigsaw puzzle!"

Olivia couldn’t help but glance up, her anger and fear momentarily forgotten. Isabella's dramatic entrance and fierce loyalty struck a chord, reminding her she wasn’t alone.

Isabella landed beside Olivia, wrapping her in a protective embrace as they steadied themselves on the swaying ladder. The chaos below seemed distant now, replaced by a sense of camaraderie and unspoken support.

"You're safe with me," Isabella assured, her voice steady and calming.

As they descended, the crowd watched in awe, their anger dissipating in the presence of Isabella's authoritative command. Once on solid ground, Isabella addressed the crowd, her voice amplified through a headset.

"You think you can bully my woman?" Isabella challenged, her gaze sweeping across the gathered reporters and onlookers. "Let's get one thing straight: Olivia Stewart is under my protection."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the crowd. The rumors about Olivia's connections with a mysterious benefactor were true, and now, faced with Isabella's undeniable influence, their accusations seemed baseless.

"And as for those photos," Isabella continued, her tone icy, "they were nothing but a fabrication, an attempt to tarnish Olivia's name. Anyone who believes otherwise will have to answer to me."

The crowd fell silent, the weight of Isabella's words sinking in. As the tension eased, Olivia felt a renewed sense of strength, bolstered by Isabella's unwavering support.

"Thank you," Olivia whispered, her voice almost lost in the wind.

Isabella smiled, a glint of mischief in her eyes. "Anytime. Now let's get out of here."

Together, they turned away from the crowd, leaving behind the chaos and stepping into a future that, despite its uncertainties, felt a little brighter with Isabella by her side.
