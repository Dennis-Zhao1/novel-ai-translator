Olivia Stewart woke up to the sight of a dazzling crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Her eyes darted around the room, taking in the intricately carved walls and the heavy, vintage curtains. Everything screamed luxury, but the question remained: "Where am I?"

Clutching her forehead, Olivia tried to piece together the events leading up to her abduction. It was clear that whoever orchestrated this had no intention of harming her—yet. Perhaps she was a bargaining chip to force Isabella Peterson into some kind of deal.

Once she assessed her situation, Olivia calmed down a bit. She maneuvered her unwieldy body to sit up, leaning against the headboard, and caught her breath before attempting to get out of bed.

The door creaked open, and in walked Alexander Peterson with a face that betrayed nothing of his intentions. Olivia wasn’t surprised. She’d had her suspicions from the moment she lost consciousness.

Alexander carried a tray with a glass of fresh milk and her favorite cheese tarts. "Eat," he said, handing her the milk. It was perfectly warm.

Olivia accepted the glass but didn’t drink. Instead, she fixed Alexander with a steady gaze. "Why?"

"I’ve lost everything but you," he replied, a shadow of melancholy passing over his eyes.

But you’re not mine. Olivia kept that thought to herself, careful not to provoke Alexander.

"If this is about the Peterson estate, Isabella can give it all to you," Olivia ventured.

"Don’t try to persuade me!" Alexander snapped, turning on his heel and leaving the room in a huff.

It seemed he intended to keep her here indefinitely.

Olivia chuckled softly, resigned to her situation, and started eating. She wasn’t worried about poison; Alexander had more than enough means to harm her if he wanted.

Being pregnant with twins meant she was hungry all the time, so Olivia quickly finished the milk and tarts. She got out of bed and made her way to the door with the empty tray.

Alexander was waiting outside, blocking her view. He took the tray, glanced at her belly, and said, "Just leave it next time. You don’t need to do this."

Olivia shrugged. "The milk was fresh, and the tarts were delicious. Thanks."

A barely noticeable smile appeared on Alexander’s face. He knew she would enjoy the food he had painstakingly prepared.

Maybe today she liked it a little, tomorrow a little more, and eventually, her heart might shift from Isabella to him.

As he adjusted his glasses, his gaze lingered on her belly, darkening with a hint of malice.

"Go back in and rest," he instructed.

Olivia stood her ground, her large, bright eyes locked on his. "I want to know what that woman sprayed on me."

"It’s harmless to the babies," Alexander assured, his tone cold.

"I never learn," Olivia sighed bitterly.

Her resigned smile seemed to pierce Alexander. He gently nudged her back into the room and shut the door with a bang.

Olivia took another good look around. The room was lavish but decorated mostly in soft pinks and purples—a deliberate attempt to create a princess-like atmosphere.

She moved to the window, hoping for clues about her location. Surely, David Wright and the others were searching by now. Alexander, with a pregnant woman in tow, would have to be close by.

However, every window she checked was obscured by greenery or led to a short corridor, beyond which was only darkness. Outside, a persistent buzzing noise filled the air, like a swarm of bees.

Where on earth was she?

It was strange, Olivia thought, racking her brain. In this city, she couldn’t imagine such a place, and if it was further away, she was even more at a loss.

She shook her head, deciding not to dwell on it. By now, Isabella must have heard about her disappearance. He must be worried sick.

For now, her best plan was to eat well, rest up, and wait for Isabella to come to her rescue.

With that in mind, Olivia behaved impeccably, finishing everything Alexander brought her and always adding a polite, "Thank you."

Day after day passed.

Alexander seemed pleased with her compliance, his gaze softening whenever he looked at her. He brought the freshest milk and fruit, and the meals were always nutritious and beautifully presented.

Once, Olivia remarked, "I had no idea you were such a good cook. You could’ve been a chef."

Alexander’s expression darkened. "I started learning to cook when I met you because back then, you were a total foodie."

"I’m sorry," Olivia murmured, lowering her eyes. "Alexander, I appreciate your effort, but we can't go back to how things were."

He flew into a rage, thrusting his fist in front of her face. "Who says we can’t? If you try, we can!"

Olivia’s eyes widened, her gaze fixed nervously on his fist. She wasn’t afraid for herself, but she feared for her children. After all, they were Isabella’s kids, and Alexander had every reason to hate them.

Seeing her fear, Alexander punched the wall beside her, blood misting in the air.

Olivia felt the wind rush past her ear. When she opened her eyes again, he was gone, having stormed off without closing the door.

Staring at the bloodstained wall for a moment, Olivia suddenly sprang into action, slipping out quietly. Her body was cumbersome, preventing her from moving quickly, and there were few places to hide.

The corridors were lined with intricately carved columns and rooms, filled with oil paintings and greenery. The air hummed with that persistent buzzing sound.

After wandering for ages, Olivia realized she was lost. This place was a labyrinth.

Breathless, she sank onto a round stool and surveyed her surroundings. It struck her as odd: in all her wandering, she hadn’t seen the sky or any sunlight.

And then it hit her like a firework.

A basement!

This was a massive underground palace!

That explained the uniform greenery and the constant buzzing—the sound of ventilation fans.

Excited by her discovery, Olivia’s cheeks flushed. She ignored her fatigue and continued her search for an exit.

If they were underground, Isabella might have no clue where to look, which explained the silence.

Olivia stopped aimlessly wandering and started examining the layout and furnishings more carefully.

Suddenly, she heard a faint sound, a muffled groan of pain mixed with a hint of satisfaction.

Someone else was here.

Were they also prisoners of Alexander?

Her heart pounded as she followed the sound to a room on the right.

The door was ajar.

Holding her breath, Olivia crept closer and peered through the crack, only to recoil in horror. Her stomach churned.

Inside was none other than Alexander Peterson!

He was using a small golden knife to cut into his own arm, blood gushing from each slice, staining his skin.

And with each cut, he sighed in satisfaction, seemingly oblivious to the pain.

This was Alexander's twisted hobby.

He wasn’t just a sadist; he was a masochist too!

Terrified, Olivia clamped a hand over her mouth and bolted.

Her nerves got the better of her, and she collided with a column, making a dull thud.

"Ugh…"

Pain throbbed from her forehead. She pressed a hand to it, feeling dizzy.

Before she could gather herself, Alexander emerged, his arm a bloody mess, the knife still in his hand.

He looked like a blood-soaked demon.

"No, stay away!" Olivia cried, backing away.

"Olivia, relax. I’d rather hurt myself than you," Alexander said, tossing the knife aside and extending a hand. "Where are you hurt? Let me see."

"No, no, no…" Olivia retreated further, stumbling against another column and clutching it for support.

"Look at you, your forehead’s bleeding. Come here!" Alexander’s tone grew firmer, a flicker of anger in his eyes.
