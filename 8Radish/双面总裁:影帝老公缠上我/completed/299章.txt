**The Secret of Mom's Keepsake**

Olivia Stewart probably didn't realize it yet, but she'd unintentionally won over the hearts of a bunch of tough guys. Initially, they followed her more out of obligation to their boss's orders. Deep down, the idea of protecting a seemingly fragile woman wasn't exactly thrilling for them. But now, Olivia's sincere words had struck a chord, making them genuinely see her as their new leader.

"Ma'am!" David Wright, the head of the security team, lowered his head. "I'm sorry for letting you get scared today. I failed to protect you properly. Please punish me."

Olivia looked at his serious demeanor and then glanced around at the other bodyguards, all wearing the same earnest expression.

A chuckle escaped Olivia's lips. "David, when danger hit, you all leaped in to shield me with your own bodies. Why would I punish you instead of thanking you?"

The bodyguards exchanged glances, puzzled. They were used to the notion that failing to protect someone deserved punishment.

David's face turned crimson. "Ma'am, since you're so generous, we'll go back and accept our punishment from the boss. Today’s mishap was my negligence. I'll take responsibility."

"By that logic," Olivia retorted, "since I ordered you to stay outside, shouldn't I be the one held accountable?"

"Uh, I..." David scratched his head, unable to argue with Olivia's reasoning.

Olivia pressed her lips together. "You think taking a hefty paycheck and not doing your job deserves punishment, right?"

"Yes!" The bodyguards nodded. It was a key principle for them.

Olivia straightened her expression. "I don't care what rules you have, but with me, I see you as trusted friends—family even! For stepping in today, I sincerely thank you."

She stepped back and gave them a respectful bow.

"Ma'am!" The tough guys were visibly moved.

"I'm someone who values loyalty and hates betrayal," Olivia continued. "When you shielded me, I knew I could trust you. Just make sure you protect yourselves too. No unnecessary sacrifices, okay?"

The bodyguards, eyes glistening, shouted in unison, "Thank you, Ma'am!"

Olivia paused, looking at David. "Don't tell Isabella Peterson about today. She's got enough on her plate. No need to distract her with trivial matters. If you trust me, let me handle this."

Without hesitation, David replied, "Yes, Ma'am!"

Olivia rose. "Let's go. We can talk more outside."

Feeling a bit guilty for disturbing the peace of the orphanage kids, Olivia led the way out. As they walked, David got a call. Approaching Olivia, he reported, "Ma'am, the hospital called. Those two women have woken up."

Olivia's eyes narrowed slightly. "Alright, I'll go check on them."

On the drive to the hospital, Olivia sat in the car, lost in thought, absentmindedly fiddling with her bracelet. Suddenly, she felt something different about one of the beads. Holding it up to the sunlight, she noticed a small engraving inside—barely decipherable, but it looked like the character 'Lu.'

Lu? Olivia frowned. Her mom's last name was Allen, and her grandmother's was Shen. This 'Lu' didn't seem connected to them. Recalling something Grace Martin had said, a thought flashed through Olivia's mind. Could this be something her mom had taken from the family back then?

If that were true, why would her mom leave such a thing for her? Quickly dismissing the thought, Olivia shook her head. Grace Martin's last name was Martin, so 'Lu' wasn't linked to her either. But who knew about her maternal relatives?

A feeling of unease stirred in Olivia. Her mom had always been distant with her but doted on her younger sister, Sophie. Yet, this unique bracelet was left to Olivia. Why?

Unable to find an answer, she stopped pondering it. Thoughts of her mom—now a fading memory—came to mind. Her mom wasn't exactly the most peaceful person, but she endured her father's outbursts with surprising patience. Olivia realized it was probably because of her existence as a 'mistake' that her mom felt guilty.

The word 'mistake' stung Olivia deeply. A surge of curiosity welled up in her; she wanted to understand her mom's past better.

Half an hour later, the car stopped smoothly in front of the hospital.

David opened the door, standing respectfully aside. "Ma'am, we're here!"

Olivia stepped out, following David to the hospital room. "Wait outside," she instructed.

"Yes!" David nodded, adding with concern, "Be careful, Ma'am!"

Olivia smiled softly. "Don't worry. Those two women aren't exactly monsters."

She pushed the door open, entering Grace Martin's room. Grace's face was severely burned and wrapped in thick bandages, resembling a mummy. Hearing footsteps, Grace waved her hand in the air, urgently calling out, "Doctor! Doctor! Can my face be saved?"

Olivia sat down beside her, her tone icy. "It can be saved. But I don't want to save it."

"It's you! What are you doing here?" Grace recognized Olivia's voice and instantly flew into a rage, spewing curses. "You wretched woman! I curse you!"

Unfazed, Olivia replied, "You should focus on your own future."

Grace's arrogance crumbled instantly, her flailing arms falling limp. Indeed, what about her future? She’d been abused before for not doing chores; now, her face was ruined...

"Daughter, please spare me!" Grace's voice turned pitiful, her pleas echoing in the room. Olivia, taken aback by the sudden change, found the term 'daughter' especially revolting.

"I'm not your daughter," Olivia retorted coldly. "Your actual daughter is in the next room."

"You are White's daughter too!" Grace ignored her pain, struggling to rise and kowtow to Olivia. Failing, she collapsed onto the bedside, begging, "Olivia, Olivia, I was wrong! Please, as your stepmother, spare me!"

Olivia's voice was icy. "I've never acknowledged him as my father. How could you be my stepmother? But, if you tell me the truth, maybe I'll help you with your injuries."

Grace, like someone lost in darkness suddenly seeing a glimmer of light, eagerly agreed. "What do you want to know?"

"I want to know about my mom's past," Olivia said simply.

"Sophia Allen, that wretched woman..." Grace started, then caught herself, fearfully glancing toward Olivia. Seeing no reaction, she continued, "Sophia Allen came from the countryside. She moved to the city alone to find work..."

From Grace’s tale, Olivia pieced together a story of a maid who used any means necessary to win favor and eventually secure her place. Despite Grace's bias, her bitter demeanor was genuine.

Grace had brought her own wealth into the marriage with White, only for him to quickly ensnare the young maid, Sophia Allen. Grace never imagined that the country girl she’d taken in would become a homewrecker.

Especially during her pregnancy with their daughter, Mia, White and Sophia were practically flaunting their affair under her nose. Before long, Sophia was pregnant too.

Grace was the first to notice. She staged a scandalous scene involving Sophia and the gatekeeper, James Cook, effectively marrying Sophia off. Grace thought removing Sophia would bring peace back home, but White's affairs only escalated, bringing in more women like a never-ending parade.

Home life became unbearable.

A year later, Grace gave birth to Mia, but White's behavior only worsened. Disappointed that Grace had a daughter, he indulged in his affairs even more.

Desperate, Grace began seeking information about Sophia. James Cook was a distant relative from her family, initially hired to manage the gatehouse. Despite being lazy and addicted to gambling, he was Grace's link to Sophia.

Upon hearing Sophia had a child back in the countryside, Grace visited, hoping to manipulate James into helping her with the child. But Sophia had a daughter too.

Their meeting turned into a shouting match.

Grace, disappointed not to gain a son, left in haste. Sophia’s scandalous past with White became public, leading to frequent beatings from James—a story for another day.

Back home, Grace discovered her prized bracelet was missing. Despite searching and firing her personal maid and the child's nanny, it remained lost, only to resurface years later on Olivia’s wrist!

After listening, Olivia sat in silence for a long time. Her mother's rise to status was a story that left her feeling deeply embarrassed.
