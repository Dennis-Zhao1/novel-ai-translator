Isabella Peterson paced around her study, trying to keep her cool. She had just gotten off the phone with her investigator, Michael Wright, who had disappointingly turned up little about Olivia Stewart’s past. It was as if someone had wiped her history clean. But Isabella wasn’t one to give up easily. "Keep digging!" she barked, determination sharpening her gaze.

After hanging up, Isabella dove into her own investigation. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she hacked into various databases, determined to uncover Olivia's secrets. As she sifted through the digital footprints, something caught her eye: Olivia had once attended a medical university but dropped out five years ago. The timing was suspiciously convenient.

Isabella’s mind raced. Olivia had been hired by her mother as a nurse back then. Could there be a connection? She needed answers.

"Michael, send me Olivia’s current address," Isabella demanded over the phone. Within seconds, Michael texted her the details: Westside Haven, Building A, Apartment 5-1. But before Isabella could tap into the security cameras for a sneak peek, Michael added, "She’s out with her guy friend, having drinks."

"Seriously?" Isabella muttered, slamming her mouse down in frustration. She grabbed her jacket and stormed out, determined to find Olivia.

Meanwhile, on a bustling street lined with food stalls and neon signs, Olivia Stewart was having a night out with her best friend, Ethan King. They were nestled in a cozy corner of a popular burger joint, with Ethan meticulously picking out her favorite toppings while Olivia downed one beer after another, tossing peanuts into an empty can for fun.

"Hey, Ethan, didn’t you have an important fashion show tonight?" Olivia slurred, half-amused.

"Eh, I ditched it. Chilling with my bestie is more important," Ethan shrugged off her question with a grin.

"You’re such a goof. I skipped my karaoke gig, you skipped your show, and we even chipped in for Daniel Johnson’s gift. You think the boss will kick us out for being such slackers?"

"Nah, as long as you’re with me, you won’t starve," Ethan reassured her.

Olivia chuckled, feeling the warmth of friendship soften the edges of her heartache. She mumbled, "Do you think I’m just unlovable? Mom left me, my boyfriend dumped me…"

"Hey, I’m here for you," Ethan declared, his voice strong and steady.

Olivia burst into laughter, "You? Seriously, Ethan, you’re nuts! I’m straight, remember?"

"Whatever. I’m letting it slide today because you’re upset. But if you keep talking like this, I might just have to knock some sense into you!"

"Okay, okay," Olivia giggled, calming down. "You’re right. We both like guys, so what’s the point? I’m not getting a sex change for you, no way!"

Ethan’s eyes flickered with a complex emotion, but he stayed silent, letting the moment pass. Olivia took another swig of beer, her mind drifting again to her ex-friend who stole her boyfriend. "Do you think Ethan, one day you’ll steal my guy too?"

"Comparing me to that backstabber? I’d never do that. I’d drink with you till dawn if it helps, but if you’re still hung up on that jerk Daniel, I’ll lose respect for you."

"I’m not sad about him, more like annoyed," Olivia admitted, the bitterness creeping back in. "He’s just a tabloid chaser. Sure, Emily has a local shop, but if I told him I’m rich, he’d come crawling back, wouldn’t he?"

"In your dreams, girl! Olivia, trust me, no guy is worth it, except maybe me," Ethan teased.

"Are you even a guy?" Olivia shot back, a playful grin on her lips.

"Want to find out?" Ethan challenged, a mischievous glint in his eye.

Olivia recoiled, waving her hands frantically, "Just kidding! Just kidding!"

"Okay, you seem better now. Don’t drink too much; you have that…thing coming up soon. I’ll get you something nutritious," Ethan advised, rising to fetch more food.

"You’d make a great boyfriend, Ethan," Olivia mused, watching him walk away.

Ethan paused mid-step, a bittersweet smile tugging at his lips. He knew better than to hope, but hearing her say that still resonated with him. He shook his head, continuing to the food counter.

Back at the table, Olivia’s vision blurred slightly as she continued her peanut game. Suddenly, she noticed someone sitting across from her. "Wow, Ethan, you came back fast. Did you grow taller and hotter while you were gone?"

She reached out, pinching the handsome face in front of her. Isabella Peterson was not amused, but the mistake was understandable—Olivia was clearly tipsy.

Isabella frowned at the unfamiliar germs she imagined crawling over the table, but she had more pressing concerns. "How close are you and Ethan King, really?" Isabella demanded, capturing Olivia’s attention.

"We live together… kind of," Olivia replied, wincing as Isabella tightened her grip. "Ouch, who are you?"

Isabella leaned in, her expression intense. "You live together?"

Olivia leaned back, trying to clear her head. "Misunderstanding! We share the rent; it’s expensive here. We each have our own space."

Relieved, Isabella released her grip, her demeanor softening. She slumped back into her chair, reclaiming her usual air of confidence.

Olivia, curiosity piqued, studied Isabella. "You look so familiar… have I seen you before? You’re really good-looking."

Isabella couldn’t help but smirk at the compliment, feeling oddly flattered despite the situation. Olivia’s drunken state seemed to amplify her honesty, and Isabella found it refreshing.

Then Olivia leaned in conspiratorially, eyes wide with mischief. "Hey, you’re as handsome as that celebrity… Isabella Peterson, right? I’m just a little curious… who’s the top and who’s the bottom?"

Isabella nearly choked at the implication, stunned by the bombshell. Olivia had misunderstood the nature of her and Ethan’s arrangement entirely!

Fighting the urge to laugh, Isabella ordered, "Sober her up!"

A bodyguard quickly presented a can of iced tea, complete with a straw.

Isabella nudged it towards Olivia. "Drink."

Olivia hiccupped, the alcohol clouding her senses. "Drink what? You said I shouldn’t with my… upcoming thing."

Isabella’s temper flared at the mention of Olivia’s personal details. He wanted to just pour the drink down her throat but stopped himself. Instead, he softened his voice. "It’s a new flavor of beer."

Olivia giggled, "Nice try! Ethan always uses that line."

Defeated, Isabella downed part of the tea himself. "Watch this," he said, tilting the can back.

Olivia watched, impressed despite herself. "Whoa, you’ve got skills."

Before she could finish, Isabella leaned over, pressing his lips against hers, transferring the tea with a surprising gentleness.

"Mm! Mmph…" Olivia struggled, eyes wide, but Isabella held firm, coaxing her to swallow. Only when he was sure she had sobered up a little did he finally pull away.

Panting slightly, Olivia blinked up at him, the fog in her mind clearing just a bit. Isabella couldn’t help but smirk at her bewildered expression. "Now, are you going to behave?"
