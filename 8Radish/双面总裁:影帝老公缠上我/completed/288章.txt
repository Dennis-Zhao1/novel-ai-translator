Olivia Stewart had been kidnapped.

Nathan Peterson had chased after his mistress, leaving Mrs. Chu devastated. She had never imagined that Nathan's coldness towards her was because his heart belonged to another woman. He was even willing to risk his own son's well-being to replace him with the mistress's child. Despite spending her entire life with Nathan, she realized she had never truly entered his heart. Marrying Nathan out of family obligation was a decision she now questioned—was it a blessing or a curse?

Mrs. Chu was shattered, wandering in a daze, her mind clouded by the betrayal.

Meanwhile, Isabella Peterson, who had been rushing to finish her work at Peterson Group to be with Olivia Stewart during her pregnancy, was blindsided by the turmoil at home. Juggling her responsibilities, she maintained regular video calls with Olivia, who was across the ocean, to soothe their longing for each other.

Peterson Group was a massive enterprise, and Nathan's funeral was a grand affair. The preparations were chaotic, compounded by the mess left behind by Alexander Peterson. Isabella was overwhelmed, sending out teams to track down Alexander but finding no leads. A sense of unease lingered.

That unease soon turned into reality...

Back home, Olivia Stewart was worried about Isabella, who was burning the midnight oil. She insisted on reducing their video calls to every other day to ensure Isabella got some rest. During the day in her time zone, it was the dead of night where Isabella was, and Olivia wanted to take care of herself and their baby, but she also cared deeply for Isabella.

On this particular day, Olivia decided to go shopping.

"Ms. Stewart, please wait while we clear the store!" her bodyguards said respectfully.

Olivia looked around the spacious maternity store. There weren't many customers, just a few heavily pregnant women browsing baby clothes.

"It's fine, just stick close to me," Olivia told them.

With her personal maid, Lily, by her side, and a few burly bodyguards trailing behind, Olivia slowly made her way into the store. Carrying twins, her belly was so large she could barely see her feet, making walking a challenge. She rarely ventured out since Isabella wasn't home.

Today, she realized she was short one baby blanket and decided to make a quick trip. She had personally chosen all the baby items, preparing for both a boy and a girl since they didn't know the genders.

As they entered, the presence of the bodyguards in their black coats and dark sunglasses shattered the serene atmosphere of the store. A timid pregnant woman almost stumbled, her mother-in-law supporting her, both looking at the imposing figures with silent disapproval.

Feeling guilty, Olivia apologized to the woman and instructed her bodyguards, "Wait outside. Lily can help me."

"But..." David Wright, the lead bodyguard, hesitated.

When Isabella left, she had specifically instructed them not to stray more than two steps away from Olivia.

Olivia glanced around the quiet store. "I'll be fine. I won't wander off, and I'll leave as soon as I'm done. If you scare the other pregnant women and cause a scene, it'll be more trouble than it's worth."

David reluctantly nodded, "We'll be right outside. Call me if you need anything."

With Lily's help, Olivia slowly walked towards the baby blanket section. She was cautious, eyeing her surroundings with a hint of vigilance.

With Peterson Group in turmoil and Alexander on the run, Olivia felt uneasy. Protecting herself and not letting Isabella worry was her top priority.

"Oh my, your belly is so big! Twins?" A woman approached, her eyes filled with envy as she stared at Olivia's belly.

Noticing the woman's own swollen belly, Olivia relaxed a little and smiled, "Yes, twins!"

"How wonderful! Two at once! Unlike me, I have to go through this again!" The woman scrunched her face but couldn't hide her smile.

"Even if it's tough, it's a sweet kind of pain," Olivia laughed, feeling a kinship with the woman, her maternal glow shining through.

"It's my first time as a mom, and I want to pick some things for the baby, but I don't know which brands are good."

The woman's chubby face wore a look of distress that melted Olivia's heart. She couldn't help but reach out and take the woman's hand, "I have some experience. Let me help you!"

They chatted as they walked deeper into the store, feeling like kindred spirits. Lily, however, was left behind.

Unnoticed, they moved out of the bodyguards' line of sight, but Olivia didn't realize.

"I saw an ad for this formula that looked good. Can you help me decide?"

The woman led Olivia around a tall shelf, carefully supporting her.

Olivia felt a warm sense of gratitude. "Just watch your step. My maid can help."

"That's the one!" The woman pointed to a can of formula on a high shelf, standing on tiptoes.

"Hey, be careful!" Olivia called out. "Lily can get it for you!"

"Lily, be careful!" Olivia said as her maid reached for the formula.

Olivia casually glanced around, only to realize the area was boxed in by shelves on three sides, with a wall on the fourth. They were alone.

A bad feeling crept over Olivia.

Oh no!

Just as she was about to call out to Lily, the pregnant woman suddenly pulled out a spray can and aimed it at Olivia's face. "Pssst—"

Olivia held her breath and stepped back, but she inhaled some of it. Her head spun, and she stumbled against the shelf, the impact making a dull thud.

"Olivia!" Lily, having grabbed the formula, turned at the sound—

"Pssst!" "Pssst!"

Two more bursts of spray, and Lily collapsed, the can rolling away.

Olivia clung to consciousness, weakly asking, "You're a mother too, why..."

The woman looked at her apologetically, "I'm sorry. They injected me with something—if I didn't do this, my child would be at risk!"

Olivia's eyelids grew heavy, and the last sliver of light vanished, plunging her world into darkness...

David Wright and the bodyguards had been waiting at the entrance for a while without seeing Olivia. Anxiety gnawed at him.

This was a high-end maternity store, offering a relaxed shopping experience with no surveillance cameras inside. Once out of sight, there was no way to know what was happening inside.

After about half an hour, David couldn't wait any longer.

"You guys stay here and keep watch. I'll go check," he said, heading inside.

Olivia and Lily hadn't brought any electronics to avoid radiation—an oversight that proved costly.

David soon found Lily unconscious, immediately realizing something was wrong. He ordered his team to seal all store exits, but it was too late. Olivia had been taken, and they had no idea by whom or how.

David quickly called Isabella to report the situation.

Isabella had just returned from Nathan's funeral when she got the call. Dropping everything, she boarded a flight home, ordering more resources to find Alexander.

Lily had been hit with a powerful sedative and wouldn't wake up for hours. When she did, she could only recall that the kidnapper was a pregnant woman, providing no other useful clues.

How could a pregnant woman kidnap Olivia?

Clearly, she was just a pawn.

Who was the mastermind?

Isabella's team scoured the city from top to bottom, finding nothing. There were no records of Olivia or Alexander leaving through any checkpoints, airports, or ports.

It was clear the perpetrator had either hidden their identity or found a secret place to hold Olivia.

Isabella stared at the computer screen, her fingers flying over the keyboard. He hadn't slept in two days, keeping vigil over the screen. He'd embedded code into various systems but found no leads.

Lucas Wright stood by, refilling Isabella's coffee and urging him to rest. "Sir, you should take a break."

Though Lucas wished Olivia could be found soon, he worried Isabella might collapse from exhaustion.

"Don't worry, I won't fall until I find Olivia," Isabella rasped.

He hadn't taken his eyes off the screen, sipping his bitter coffee and continuing his search.

"You know, Olivia's pregnant and due soon. Every minute counts, and she's probably scared, hoping I'll show up..."

Isabella's voice broke, unable to continue.

Olivia had been missing for two days. No ransom, no leads—his panic grew by the minute.
