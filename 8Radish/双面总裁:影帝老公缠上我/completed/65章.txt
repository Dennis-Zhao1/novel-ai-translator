When Olivia Stewart first went out to eat with Isabella Peterson, it was like being trapped in a never-ending shrimp feast. She later joked that her entire being was infused with the scent of shrimp, and even her burps smelled of it. After repeatedly expressing that the most memorable part of the dinner was the way Mr. Chu peeled shrimp, Isabella finally let her off the hook.

Olivia's phone suddenly buzzed with a call from Sophie Cook, and she smacked her forehead in realization. Oh no! She got so caught up in bickering with Isabella over shrimp that she forgot to transfer money to Sophie!

Glancing at Isabella, Olivia said, "Uh, I need to take this call outside?"

But Isabella pulled her back into her seat. "What kind of sketchy call are you taking? Do it here."

With no choice, Olivia answered, and sure enough, Sophie was on the other end, complaining, "Hey, where's the five thousand bucks you promised?"

"Oh, Sophie, I'm so sorry! I'll transfer it right now!" Olivia quickly ended the call and transferred the money, hoping Isabella wouldn't catch on to what was up.

Isabella eyed her phone suspiciously. "Is it that debt collector again? Your sister?"

Olivia sheepishly put her phone away. "Uh, it's just a neighbor's kid. She's studying in the city and asked me to help out."

Isabella snorted, clearly not buying Olivia's weak excuse. "You earned that five grand for her?"

Olivia carefully chose her words, resting her chin on her hand. "Well, Sophie loves Tiani as much as I do, and I had extra concert tickets, so I lent her the money for one."

Isabella smirked. "As long as you don't lend her your man, lend her whatever you like."

Olivia tilted her head with a cheeky grin. "What if I really lent you out?"

"Wouldn't be too bad."

Olivia immediately shot back, "Dream on!"

"Women, always saying one thing and meaning another." Isabella rolled his eyes, but his gaze was full of affection.

Burping again, Olivia tapped her head, blinking in confusion. "I feel like I forgot something."

Isabella leaned in close, his handsome face drawing near. "You did."

"Hmm?"

He pointed to his lips. "You forgot to thank me!"

"Thank you?"

"I spent all night peeling shrimp for you, didn't even eat one. Don't you owe me a little gratitude?"

"Ugh, Isabella, can you stop mentioning shrimp? Ugh, so much… who told you not to eat?"

"You said that fussy guy peeled shrimp for you without eating any himself."

This petty guy! Still hung up on that!

"Ugh… back then, we could only afford one plate, but today you ordered a whole table! I'm stuffed! Ugh… if I break out in pimples, I'll blame you!"

Isabella handed her a glass of water, gently patting her back. "Don't worry, I'll help you cool down when we get home, no pimples, promise."

"Pfft—" Olivia sputtered, spraying water all over Isabella's shirt and even splattering his face.

Isabella looked like he'd been dunked in a bucket of cold water. "Olivia Stewart!"

"My bad, my bad!" Olivia quickly apologized, emphasizing her innocence. "I didn't mean to!"

Isabella wiped his face with a napkin, then started unbuttoning his shirt.

Olivia panicked, rushing to stop him. "What are you doing?"

Surely, he wasn't planning to strip her down right here, was he? That would make her the talk of the town for sure!

Isabella watched her animated expressions with amusement, flicking her on the forehead. "What are you thinking? Scaredy-cat! I'm in a bad mood, no time for you."

"Then why are you undressing?"

"You drenched me in spit, it's gross!"

Isabella quickly undid all his buttons, revealing a well-toned chest and defined abs, his skin a warm, inviting tan.

Olivia glanced, then quickly looked away, feeling her face heat up.

"Interested?"

"…"

"I give you permission to be interested! But I'd rather you act on it!"

Olivia rolled her eyes, stepping forward to button up his shirt again. Isabella watched, puzzled, as she diligently did up each button, even the collar. Finally, she patted his arm with a winning smile. "Let's go home!"

Isabella glared at the damp spot on his shirt. "You're seriously letting me walk out like this?"

"Come on, it's just a few steps through the lobby. No one's gonna notice."

"No way! It's filthy! I feel like ants are crawling all over me!"

"You have to wear it! Unless you want to streak through the lobby? That's way more embarrassing."

Isabella's eyes ignited with two fiery sparks. "With this body, embarrassing?"

"Not embarrassing, just humiliating!"

"You… Olivia Stewart!"

Isabella grabbed Olivia's chin, glaring at her as if he wanted to take a bite out of her.

She dared call him humiliating!

"Why are you so fierce? Think you're the only one with big eyes?"

Olivia glared right back, determined not to back down.

Wow, this little thing's got guts today!

Isabella's eyes softened, more curious than angry now. "Tell me, how am I humiliating?"

"Look at the lobby!" Olivia pointed through the glass. "So many people out there! You want to show off your body and have all the pretty ladies drool over you?"

Isabella suddenly understood, his lips curling into a smile that was downright enchanting. Olivia was caught off guard, unable to tear her gaze from his bright, fiery eyes.

Her mouth opened, but no words came out.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, his features spreading into a full-on smirk. He reached over and rang the bell, calling out loudly, "A bottle of vintage vinegar, please!"

The server outside must have thought they'd misheard. "Excuse me, Isabella, did you say vintage…?"

"Vinegar!"

"Right away, sir!"

Olivia came back to her senses, feeling embarrassed. "Isabella, what are you doing?"

Most people ask for vintage wine, but he was asking for vinegar!

Isabella didn't answer, just continued to look at her with a smug grin.

Soon, the server brought in the vinegar. Isabella took the bottle, unscrewed the cap, and poured it elegantly into a wine glass, his every move exuding an air of sophistication, as if he were pouring a fine aged wine instead of a few dollars' worth of vinegar.

Olivia watched, oddly fascinated. This guy made everything look good!

Isabella filled two glasses halfway, set the bottle down, and handed one to Olivia. Picking up his own glass, he clinked it against hers. "Cheers!"

If Olivia didn't get the hint now, she really would be clueless. Her cheeks flushed red, and she pouted. Why was it that when he got jealous, she had to endure a shrimp feast, but when she made a single snarky comment, he turned it into a whole dramatic production?

"Fine, I'll drink!" Olivia raised her glass and tipped it back.

"Don't!"

Isabella reached out to stop her.

That was vinegar, not something you'd want to gulp down!

He was just teasing her, not expecting she'd actually drink it!

"Whoosh—" The vinegar in Olivia's glass, thanks to Isabella's quick intervention, splashed all over his white shirt.

Now it was not only dirty and unsightly, but it also reeked of vinegar.

Olivia instinctively pinched her nose.

Isabella's expression darkened like a storm cloud. "You're disgusted by me now?"

Olivia quickly dropped her hand, waving it in denial. "No, no, I just had an itchy nose and scratched it."

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "You trying to fool a ghost?"

"Uh… it's not that I'm disgusted, it's just, the vinegar smell is so strong."

"You noticed the strong vinegar smell? I told you to drink it, and you were going to chug it, silly!"

"Actually…" Olivia fiddled with her fingers, nervously glancing at Isabella. "I wasn't really going to drink it."

So… he'd misread the situation?

Before Isabella could explode, Olivia bolted out of the room. "I'm going to the restroom!"

"Olivia Stewart!"

Isabella's angry voice echoed behind her as she dashed away.

Olivia burst into the bathroom, quickly locking the door. Soon there was a pounding on the door, accompanied by Isabella's furious shout, "Olivia Stewart, come out!"

Olivia pressed against the door, stubborn as a mule. "No!"

"I'll give you one second. If you don't come out, I'll strangle you!"

"Isabella, do you think I'm stupid? If I come out, I'll be strangled in less than a second!"

"Not coming out? Fine! If you stay in there forever, I'll just strip and walk out! Let people see, who cares?"

Isabella's indignant threats echoed, his footsteps stomping away until there was silence.

Did he really leave?
