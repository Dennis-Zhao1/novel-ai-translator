Title: He Loves Me, Just Me

Olivia Stewart turned around, her eyes landing on Mia Bai, who stood a few feet away, looking all fierce and feisty. Today, Mia was dressed in a bright red mink coat paired with a leather skirt. It should have looked classy and sophisticated, but her aggressive demeanor ruined the whole vibe.

Annoyed, Olivia raised an eyebrow, "What's up?"

Mia couldn't hold back, "What did you do to Isabella Peterson? He won't even let me in the house!"

Ah, the classic case of beauty without brains.

Olivia chuckled, clapping her hands as she observed Mia's perfectly made-up yet weary face. "Aren't you supposed to be Isabella's fiancée? It's been days, and he still won't let you in. Pathetic!"

Mia's face flushed with embarrassment. "How dare you mock me?"

Olivia continued to laugh, "Well, you practically begged for it."

Sorry, but I'm not as gracious as you might think when someone tries to steal my man.

"You..." Mia bit her lip, speechless.

Olivia leaned in, her smile wicked like a mischievous devil. "Want to know why he won't let you in? Because you're just... so... annoying!"

"..."

"And, by the way, he loves me, just me!" Olivia wiggled her pinky in front of Mia, "Only one, got it?"

Mia was left speechless by Olivia's taunts, her face a mix of red and white, wishing she could bite off that waving finger.

Olivia withdrew her finger, her face turning cold as she strutted past Mia. But as she did, the icy mask she wore cracked slightly.

Mia finally snapped out of her daze and lunged for Olivia's long hair, "You're not going anywhere!"

Before Olivia could turn around, Ty intervened, swiftly grabbing Mia's wrist.

"Who are you? Let go!" Mia yelped, tears rolling down her face from the pain.

Ty, usually as gentle as a breeze, now emanated a chilling aura. His blue eyes narrowed dangerously, a steely gleam in them.

Mia flinched, both frightened and inexplicably drawn to his gaze, staring back at him timidly.

Olivia turned back, seeing this scene, and felt an unexpected irritation, glaring at Ty.

Ty's heart fluttered with a strange joy. He let go of Mia's wrist with a commanding air, "Get lost!"

Mia stumbled back a few steps, and when she finally steadied herself, she was met with Olivia's undisguised mocking expression. Furious, she shouted, "What are you so smug about? Just because you have a man helping you?"

Olivia found this amusing, crossing her arms and giving Mia a sidelong glance, "Yeah, if you're so unhappy, why don't you find a man to help you? Better yet, get Isabella Peterson over here and see whose side he's on!"

"You... huh! Even if he helps you, so what? Can you get him to marry you? I'm the officially recognized fiancée of the Peterson family, and you're just a cheap mistress!"

Olivia's face turned pale, unable to maintain her façade of indifference.

Suddenly, Isabella Peterson casually kicked a pebble, which flew into Mia's mouth, breaking one of her front teeth.

"Ah!" Mia screamed, clutching her mouth, glaring at Ty, her words garbled, "Who do you think you are? Just a mere actor, not even worthy to shine Isabella Peterson's shoes!"

Ty's face remained cold as he kicked another pebble, hitting Mia's cheek, leaving a small bloody hole. Mia shrieked and fled, crying all the way.

Olivia watched her embarrassing retreat, but couldn't find it in herself to laugh anymore.

Mia was right; she was just the mistress.

Isabella saw her troubled expression, grasping her shoulders and forcing her to look at him, "Don't overthink it!"

His commanding tone was so like Isabella Peterson, only Ty's voice was deeper, more husky, with a touch of tenderness.

Olivia sniffed, looking up at Ty, "Forget the coffee, let's go to a bar instead."

Ty noticed her slightly reddish eyes, his heart aching, though his voice was firm, "You should trust your man!"

Olivia stared at him, surprised.

"I hate this ostrich attitude of yours! This isn't your fault! You and Isabella Peterson started five years ago; Mia is the intruder!"

Olivia blinked.

Was he comforting me or scolding me?

"But..." Olivia looked away, uneasy, "She's Isabella Peterson's fiancée. What am I?"

Yeah, after all this time, he never made any promises. Turns out he already had a fiancée, and he never broke off the engagement with Mia.

Thinking of this, Olivia's lips curled in self-deprecation.

Ty was angered by Olivia's bitter smile, tightening his grip on her shoulders as he growled, "Olivia Stewart, you fool! You're Isabella Peterson's true love. Mia is nothing! The one who isn't loved is the third wheel!"

Olivia stared at Ty's angry face in shock.

The one who isn't loved is the third wheel? That's a new one.

But somehow, it made her feel a lot better.

Olivia pouted, "How much could he possibly love me? If he did, why would he have a fiancée? Why let her provoke me?"

"You don't understand how family marriages work! You'll never know what he's done for you!"

Olivia gazed into Ty's blue eyes, a strange light flickering in her mind, but when she tried to grasp it, it vanished like smoke in the wind.

Olivia was frustrated, frowning as she tried to think it through.

Ty suddenly realized he had overreacted, quickly pulling Olivia along, "Didn't you say you wanted a drink? Let's go!"

His interruption completely scattered Olivia's strange feeling. But Ty's earlier words about Mia being the third wheel were deeply rooted in her heart.

Both being public figures, they couldn't just go to any bar, so Ty took Olivia to a private room in his own place.

As soon as they entered, Olivia tossed aside her sunglasses, flopping onto the couch, and called out to the waiter, "Bring me your strongest drinks!"

Ty chuckled, "One strong drink and you'll be out. How will you enjoy the process of getting drunk?"

Olivia tilted her head in thought, "True! But in the end, drunk is drunk. One drink or a thousand, what's the difference? When I'm drunk, I can sleep, no worries at all!"

Ty laughed, "You trust me that much?"

Olivia glanced around the room, feigning nonchalance, "If I could snag a national heartthrob, that wouldn't be bad!"

Her words were so straightforward, almost like an invitation. She might as well have told Ty: Do whatever you want if I get drunk!

Ty felt a vein throb on his forehead, tempted to pull Olivia over his knee and spank her.

This bold little thing was already talking nonsense before she even got drunk?

Was she planning to use another guy to get back at him because his fiancée showed up? If it hadn't been him here today...

Isabella Peterson coldly ordered a few drinks, waving the waiter away.

He wanted to see how far this woman would go!

The waiter quickly brought the drinks and discreetly left.

Ty poured Olivia a drink himself. He knew her limits, so he picked smooth, low-alcohol options. But even so, after two drinks, Olivia's gaze turned hazy, a dreamy look settling on her face as she stared at Ty.

"Ty, let's date!"

This little minx, as expected!

Ty felt a jealous fire burning inside, his fingers gripping the glass tightly, almost shattering it. He stared at Olivia, asking coldly, "What, you stopped loving Isabella Peterson so soon?"

Olivia waved her hand, slurring, "Who loves him? Not me, not at all! He doesn't want me, so why should I love him?"

Ty raised an eyebrow, "Are you sure he doesn't want you, or is he just busy dealing with things?"

Olivia opened her mouth to argue but couldn't find the right words, finally frowning and complaining, "Why do you always side with him?"

"It's just the truth."

Ty replied, taking a sip of his wine. Olivia wouldn't listen to him now, so if he didn't use this opportunity to defend himself a bit, he might really lose her.

Olivia's cute face scrunched up, twirling her glass with one hand, resting her chin on the other, deep in thought, as if evaluating the truth in Ty's words.

After a while, Olivia reached a conclusion, "Hmph, even if he still wants me, I don't want him anymore!"

Ty's heart tightened, "Why?"

"If he had been honest about his fiancée from the start, I might have stood by him. But now..."

So that's the root of the problem!
