I Wonâ€™t Thank You

Alexander Peterson looked at Olivia Stewart's worried face, and a guilty smile crept onto his own, unable to hide the deep infatuation and longing in his eyes.

Olivia, shocked, pointed at Alexander, her hand trembling, "You... you... you killed him?"

"No!" Alexander's lips formed a bitter smile. "If it was truly your child, how could I bear to harm them?"

"When Isabella Peterson returned to the Peterson Estate, I had her every move under surveillance. I found out she was looking for the child, so I sent someone to investigate the old leads. I discovered that James Cook had sold the child, but the news I got was that the child had already passed away."

Olivia bit her lip, her eyes filling with tears. Although she had never met the child, the thought of them tugged painfully at her heart.

Alexander continued softly, "I wanted to find the child first to use as leverage against Isabella, but with the child gone, I lost my bargaining chip. When I returned to Golden City, I met Xia, and learned that the child she had given birth to had a congenital heart defect and was left at an orphanage. I took advantage of the situation to mislead Isabella into finding that child."

"You wanted to use that child to drive a wedge between Olivia and me, but didn't expect that Tongtong would be your own biological son?" Isabella Peterson's voice was cold as she laid bare Alexander's unfinished plan.

"Yes," Alexander admitted openly. "When Xia told me she was pregnant, I thought it was a joke. How could an infertile man have a child? Who knew..."

Alexander stopped, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes.

"The child will know the truth one day. Have you thought about how you'll face him in the future?" Olivia's voice was soft but struck Alexander's heart like a drum.

His heart, encased in layers of ice, began to crack.

Alexander's face turned pale. Though his expression revealed nothing, the darkness in his eyes was impossible to hide.

"Take care of yourself," Olivia sighed softly and walked away. Despite mentally preparing herself for the news, hearing that the child was gone felt like a heavy weight pressing on her chest.

Isabella took Olivia's hand as they climbed the stairs, and once in the warm sunlight, she pulled Olivia into a tight embrace.

"Isabella?" Olivia exclaimed, surprised.

"If I hadn't left suddenly back then, the child wouldn't have..." Isabella's voice choked with emotion.

That had been their first child, the product of their young, wild love.

Olivia rubbed her face against Isabella's chest, her voice muffled, "I don't blame you. Blaming anyone for what happened is pointless now. Let's cherish the present and focus on our future."

"Yeah," Isabella murmured, burying her face in Olivia's neck, breathing in deeply.

...

The next day, Tongtong woke up, finally out of danger. As soon as he was moved to a regular hospital room, Xia rushed in to see him.

"Who are you?" Tongtong's wide eyes were filled with wariness.

"I... I'm your family's new housekeeper," Xia stammered.

Tongtong looked at Olivia, who nodded at him with a smile, and he finally relaxed.

"Tongtong, you can call her Aunt Xia. She saved you when you were unconscious," Olivia said gently.

Understanding Xia's feelings as a mother, Olivia didn't hold back in trying to foster a good impression of her.

Xia turned to Olivia with a grateful smile, and when she looked back at Tongtong, her eyes were filled with affection.

Tongtong's face remained expressionless, only nodding politely at Xia, "Thank you for saving me."

Xia smiled softly, reaching to touch Tongtong's head but thought better of it, withdrawing her hand. "Young Master, is there anything you'd like to eat?"

Tongtong turned his face away slightly, "No, I can take care of myself. You don't need to stay here."

Xia panicked, "Young Master, do you dislike me?"

Before Olivia could console Xia, Tongtong turned back, a look of resignation and impatience on his face, "Stay if you want."

Seeing Tongtong, who was usually indifferent, change his mind for someone else's sake, Olivia pressed her lips together in a small smile.

Perhaps they were still strangers, but the natural bond of blood was undeniable.

To give the two more time alone, Olivia left after sitting with Tongtong for a while.

As soon as Olivia was gone, Tongtong's demeanor changed, and he looked at Xia with a cold, distant gaze.

"Now that my aunt is gone, you don't have to pretend to care about me," Tongtong said coldly.

Xia was taken aback, not understanding why Tongtong was suddenly so hostile. "I... I..."

"What do you mean, 'I'?" Tongtong looked at her with disdain. "Don't think that just because you saved me, I'll be grateful. You probably used that as an excuse to stay here and work. Otherwise, why would my aunt hire a housekeeper for someone my age?"

Xia's face turned pale. Tongtong's words were true; she had asked to stay on as a housekeeper, but her only motive was to see and care for him.

She hadn't expected Tongtong to misinterpret her intentions.

Tears welled up in Xia's eyes, and she trembled, at a loss for words.

"I'm going to sleep now, go away!" Tongtong turned his back on her, pulling the covers over his head.

He particularly disliked this woman right now. If it weren't for her, Olivia would have stayed to keep him company. It was all this annoying woman's fault!

Olivia was probably busy preparing for her wedding now, having another child with someone else, about to start a new family.

And he, from beginning to end, was always the extra one.

Tears fell down Tongtong's cheeks, and he curled up under the covers, crying quietly.

Suddenly, a hand rested on his back through the blanket, patting gently and rhythmically.

Tongtong almost wanted to laugh at the maid treating him like a three-year-old, but he couldn't bring himself to smile.

Because, in memory, no one had ever soothed him to sleep so gently.

Growing up in the orphanage, there were too many children and not enough attention. No one had time to lull them to sleep.

When Olivia came into his life, he was already a few years old. Olivia brought him food and toys, played with him, and brought joy to his life.

Later, when Olivia took him home, her way of putting him to bed was mostly storytelling. Sometimes, she'd fall asleep mid-story from exhaustion.

He had really given Olivia a hard time back then!

Under the covers, Tongtong bit his lip, more tears streaming down.

He knew it was unmanly to cry at his age, but the thought of his mom becoming someone else's wife made him miserable.

A sense of being abandoned spread through his heart.

Tongtong even wondered if Olivia knew about the incident with Guoguo and had given up on him because of it. Or maybe, for saving Guoguo, she might love him a bit more?

Lost in thought, Tongtong drifted into a drowsy state.

Throughout, Xia's hand continued its gentle patting, bringing a sense of calm.

Tongtong's eyelids drooped, and he finally fell asleep.

Just as he entered dreamland, the scene from that day with Guoguo in the forest played out in his mind. He saw himself pushing Guoguo, being thrown by Uncle Golden Finger, and slashing his neck, the world around him growing cold and dim, as though he was seeing the gates of heaven...

Suddenly, a soft voice called out from the air, "Child, I'm sorry! Child, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have left you to suffer so much. I was wrong..."

Tongtong awoke with a start, blinking away the wetness on his lashes.

He was about to move when the voice came again from behind, filled with tears, "Child, don't worry. I'll never leave you again. No matter what, I'll always be by your side."

Not a dream?

It was the maid!

Tongtong snapped fully awake, quickly turning to see Xia sitting at his bedside, hands covering her face, crying softly and murmuring.

"What did you just say?"

Startled by his voice, Xia looked up, seeing Tongtong's wide eyes fixed on her. She quickly wiped her tears and mumbled, "Nothing."

"Who were you calling 'child'? Whose mother are you?" Tongtong's bright eyes bore into her, demanding the truth.

Xia's gaze flickered with uncertainty, "Did you hear everything?"

"Yes!" Tongtong replied, eyes intense, "So, I want the truth!"

"But... Olivia told me not to tell you!" Xia bit her lip, hesitating.

Seeing her son awake and knowing his heart condition was treated, Xia was eager to claim him. But Olivia had insisted that Tongtong needed time to adjust. Xia had been worried about how to reveal the truth, but now, Tongtong was asking himself. If Olivia was to blame anyone, it wouldn't be her, right?
