Title: A Calculated Engagement

Olivia Stewart was feeling pretty chill despite Grace Martin’s desperate attempts to persuade her. Isabella Peterson, her ever-loyal confidante, was right beside her, urging her to ignore them.

“Olivia, don’t even bother with them!” Isabella said, a hint of urgency in her voice. She knew Olivia’s father, White Birch, was a fair-weather friend at best—no point in getting tangled with his ploys.

With a sweet smile, Olivia nodded to Isabella, indicating she wasn’t about to cave, and took a step towards Grace Martin. “So, have you and White Birch finally decided to let me cozy up to the Peterson family tree without any more fuss?” she asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Grace Martin’s face turned an awkward shade of red. “Olivia, you know our family’s always been dependent on the Peterson Group. A marriage alliance is all we need!”

Olivia couldn’t help but feel a small thrill at seeing the mother-daughter duo squirm. She waved her hand nonchalantly, playing along. “Alright then, I won’t hold it against you. Just make sure White Birch prepares a generous dowry. After all, if I’m marrying into the Peterson family, it better be impressive!”

Grace and her daughter, White Mia, were taken aback. Olivia hadn’t even returned to claim her place in the family, and she was already demanding a dowry?

Seeing their discomfort, Olivia raised an eyebrow. “What’s the problem? Not willing to cough it up?”

“Oh no, of course not! It’s only natural to prepare a dowry for a daughter’s marriage,” Grace stammered. “Your father is working on it! He just hopes you’ll come back to meet your uncles and other relatives.”

“I’ll think about it!” Olivia shrugged. “I’m not in the mood for family visits. I’m pretty comfortable staying with Isabella.”

Grace wanted to point out that Olivia was practically living with a man before marriage, but a glance at Isabella’s icy glare made her swallow her words.

Olivia noticed Grace’s changing expressions and knew what she was thinking, but she just smiled and pretended to be oblivious. With a baby on the way, she had no time for their games. Letting them close would only invite trouble.

Grace was getting desperate. White Birch had only one daughter, White Mia, and the family’s assets were already being eyed by other relatives. Their plan to ally with the Petersons through marriage had fallen apart when White Mia was rejected. Now Olivia was their only hope, but she wasn’t playing along.

White Birch was frantic, fearing his family’s downfall. He had been holding onto a leverage point against Nathan Peterson, but with Nathan’s influence waning, his options were limited. His hopes now rested on Olivia’s willingness to return as his daughter.

Grace and White Mia were left with no choice but to try and win Olivia over, but she was having none of it. Standing awkwardly, they didn’t dare push her further.

Isabella, watching the scene unfold, decided it was time to step in. He took Olivia’s hand, gently playing with her fingers. “Tired of standing? Should I carry you?”

Olivia rolled her eyes with a smile, taking Isabella’s arm. “Let’s just walk together.”

As they walked away, their bodyguards efficiently cleared a path through the crowd.

“Ugh…” Grace sighed, defeated.

White Mia tugged on her sleeve, grumbling, “Didn’t you hear her? She’s demanding a dowry! We’ll just tell Dad and see how he deals with it.”

Grace sighed deeply, stroking White Mia’s hair. “I know it’s hard, but for now, we have to cooperate. If we don’t, your father might just kick us out.”

White Mia was furious. As the esteemed daughter of the White family, she was used to getting what she wanted. Now she had to bow and scrape for Olivia’s favor. It was infuriating.

With tears in her eyes, White Mia followed her mother out of the hospital, both of them plotting their next move.

The next day, White Birch showed up at Olivia’s place, gifts in hand, trying to make amends.

Olivia was busy in the kitchen, checking on some soup she was making for her little brother, Tommy, when Lucas Wright, the head of the household staff, came in. “Olivia, White Birch is here to see you.”

Olivia raised an eyebrow. “He’s got my dowry ready already? But Isabella hasn’t even proposed yet. What’s the rush?”

Isabella’s amused voice came from outside the kitchen, “In a hurry to get married, are we?”

“Who said anything about that?” Olivia shot back, her cheeks turning pink. “You haven’t even proposed, and who says I’d say yes?”

Isabella wrapped his arms around her waist. “I told you the kitchen’s dangerous. What are you doing in here?”

“I’m just checking the soup,” Olivia replied. “Tommy’s been waiting for his surgery, and I want to make sure he’s well-fed.”

Isabella frowned. “I’m out there working hard for our future, and you’re here, fussing over the soup.”

Olivia laughed. “Jealous of your own son? Don’t worry, I’ve made some for you too.”

Lucas cleared his throat, trying to be discreet. “Excuse me, but what about White Birch?”

Isabella turned to Olivia. “Do you want to see him?”

Olivia grinned mischievously. “Tell him to come back when he’s got the dowry ready.”

Lucas nodded and left to relay the message, leaving Isabella and Olivia to their banter.

Meanwhile, White Birch left empty-handed, realizing Olivia saw right through his scheme. He’d have to come up with a proper dowry if he wanted to win her over.

Time flew by, and Olivia’s pregnancy was advancing. Tommy was sent abroad for heart surgery, and Olivia, unable to travel, had to let him go with a heavy heart.

The waiting was tough, but soon enough, something big happened at the Peterson Group...
