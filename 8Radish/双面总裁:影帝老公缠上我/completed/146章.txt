Olivia Stewart pretended not to catch the sarcasm in Ethan Sky's voice, deciding to play along instead. "Well, then, why don't we let Sophie Cook take my place and act in this intimate scene with you?"

The idea of having Sophie Cook as a stand-in was so outrageous it almost made Ethan Sky's eyebrows knit together in one thick line. A frosty aura seemed to emanate from him, chilling the air.

But Olivia seemed oblivious, continuing to pitch her case with gusto. "Ethan, just think about it. Sophie Cook is a better actress than me, and her looks are stunning. From a profile, we look almost identical. Using her as a stand-in is just perfect!"

Her excitement built, and she pushed Sophie Cook right in front of Ethan. Suddenly, she felt the air pressure around her drop, shivering as she locked eyes with Ethan's piercing blue gaze. Was he...not happy about this?

But it was just acting, right? For a guy, the more women he could get close to, the better, right? So, what was Ethan's deal?

Olivia pondered for a moment, then gritted her teeth and nudged Sophie Cook even closer to Ethan, flashing a bright smile. "Ethan, I'm not a professional actress, and I really can't handle these intimate scenes. You wouldn't want to see me get yelled at by Director King repeatedly, would you? So, please, let Sophie Cook play opposite you just this once. I can learn a lot watching from the sidelines, don't you think?"

Did she really want to watch him kiss another woman? Ethan's cold gaze lingered on Olivia, an unreadable expression in his eyes. His voice was icy as he asked, "Do you really want Sophie Cook to be your stand-in for this scene?"

If Olivia hadn't sensed Ethan's underlying anger by now, she would be a complete fool. But thinking of what Sophie had gone through for her, especially the scar she got trying to help, Olivia felt she owed her this chance. She stiffened her resolve and answered, "Yes!"

The moment the word left her lips, Ethan's reply came swift and sharp as an ice pick: "Fine."

Olivia suddenly felt a pang of guilt, but she didn't dare meet his eyes. Instead, she squeezed Sophie's hand in reassurance, urging her to do well, and quietly retreated to the sidelines.

Outside the set, the other actresses erupted into chatter. Some sneered at Olivia for passing up such a golden opportunity and potentially angering the leading man, which could spell disaster for her career. Others were green with envy, wishing they'd cozied up to Olivia for a shot at this intimate scene themselves.

As Olivia made her way out, several actresses rushed to her, offering chairs, water, and even shoulder massages, trying their best to curry favor. Even those who usually held themselves in high regard didn't miss the chance to fawn over her.

The only one who remained aloof was Lisa, sitting in her wheelchair with a face like a thundercloud. Her long, crimson nails scratched the armrests, making a grating noise that complemented her venomous expression perfectly. "Olivia Stewart, who do you think you are?" she muttered.

Back when her sister was strutting the red carpet, Olivia was probably playing in some back alley. Why should a former star like Lisa grovel before someone as insignificant as Olivia? Ethan was such a proud man; how dare Olivia reject an intimate scene with him? Did she think her future would be bright from now on?

Lisa cast a disdainful glance at the actresses fawning over Olivia and snorted, "Bunch of brainless idiots!"

Olivia finally managed to shake off the persistent crowd of admirers. She found a seat under the trees at the edge of the set, watching Sophie and Ethan prepare for the scene, thinking to herself, "If Ethan gives Sophie special attention because of this scene, that would be amazing!"

In the center, Ethan maintained his aloof demeanor, ignoring Sophie's every flirtatious gesture, seemingly waiting for his cue. But in reality, he was watching Olivia out of the corner of his eye the whole time.

When he noticed the smile on Olivia's face, especially the mischievous sparkle in her eyes, his own eyes grew colder, like an icy pool. How big did a woman's heart have to be to smile while her man was with another woman?

Caught up in jealousy, Ethan forgot one crucial detail: he wasn't Olivia's boyfriend, Ethan King, at the moment. He was her co-star, Ethan Sky. Olivia wanting to pass on the scene was perfectly normal. Did he expect her to be jealous and possessive over his current persona? That would be betraying his real self.

Ethan, frustrated but with no outlet, seized the opportunity when Director King called for a retake. He dove into the scene with reckless abandon, not caring for the aesthetics, and dramatically pulled Sophie into a kiss.

Sophie's heart raced, her eyes fluttering shut as she shyly awaited the kiss. Ethan moved in quickly but paused just before their lips met, his eyes half-closed, watching Olivia's reaction.

Suddenly, Olivia sprang from her seat like a cannonball. Ethan's heart leaped with joy, his icy gaze softening into something warm and bright, like diamonds catching the light. Ha! He knew she couldn't hold back.

Just as their lips were about to meet, Ethan abruptly pulled away, pushing Sophie aside and opening his arms to welcome Olivia. He never intended to go through with the scene with Sophie; it was all for show.

Sophie, caught off guard by the sudden shove, stumbled to the ground, bewildered. What just happened? Was this part of the script?

As Sophie struggled to sit up, Olivia dashed past her, and Ethan's gaze, filled with warmth and affection, tracked her every move. But Olivia didn't stop by him; she ran straight past.

Ethan's brow furrowed into a knot. Following her gaze, his face fell. Damn it!

Without hesitation, Ethan turned and strode after Olivia. On set, Sophie lay ignored, a pitiful figure amid the mocking laughter around her. Realization dawned on her: she was just collateral damage, discarded and humiliated. From paradise to hell in a second!

Sophie clawed at the cold, hard stone beneath her, snapping two manicured nails. All her shame and resentment crystallized into one name: Olivia Stewart!

Meanwhile, Olivia was oblivious to the drama unfolding behind her, focused solely on the familiar figure in the distance. "Madman!"

"Ethan King!" she shouted, joyfully throwing herself into his arms like an excited bird. "Where have you been, you crazy fool? I've missed you!"

Ethan wrapped an arm around her, smoothing her silky hair with a tenderness that belied his usual devil-may-care demeanor. "Olivia, I've missed you too. A lot."

If she had looked up then, she would have seen the same deep affection in Ethan's eyes that Isabella Peterson had for her. She was never just a friend to him. But he had always hidden it carefully, and her obliviousness had kept it secret.

Ethan Sky arrived just in time to see them locked in a warm embrace. That damned pretty boy had returned so soon. And Olivia, brazenly hugging another man in front of him? She was so dead.

Ethan marched forward, pulling Olivia away from Ethan King without a word and landing a punch on his rival's face. Ethan King staggered back, blood trickling from his nose and lips, his cheek swelling.

The stage was set for drama, and Olivia was right in the middle of it all, caught between two worlds and two men.
