In a bustling film set, Ethan King found himself once again in the shadows, observing Olivia Stewart with an intensity that bordered on obsession. Every day, he arrived early, choosing a discreet corner to watch her, never revealing his presence. His heart ached as he watched Olivia interact with others, especially the leading men, both on and off the screen. Yet, he couldn't bring himself to look away.

Today was no different, until the arrival of Emily Young shook things up. She stormed onto the scene with all the subtlety of a freight train, her presence impossible to ignore. Emily, the wife of Olivia's ex, had a reputation that preceded her, and Ethan quickly recognized her from afar.

Ethan's instincts told him that Emily's intentions weren't friendly, so he quickly intercepted her. Emily, ready to unleash a tirade, was momentarily struck dumb by Ethan's striking looks, which only added to her irritation.

"Excuse me, could you move?" Emily snapped, trying to regain her composure.

Ethan, unfazed, stood his ground. "What do you want with Olivia?"

Emily's bravado faltered as she took in Ethan's sharp features and steely demeanor. She had initially come to confront Olivia over a past incident involving her husband, Daniel Johnson, but Ethan's presence complicated things.

Emily attempted to appeal to Ethan's sensibilities, casting doubts about Olivia's fidelity in hopes of swaying him. "You know, Olivia's not as innocent as she seems. My husband, who’s now in the hospital thanks to someone on her side, has seen things..."

Ethan's eyes darkened at the insinuation. "I don't care about your husband or your drama. If you're here to cause trouble for Olivia, think again."

Emily, sensing a potential ally turned foe, pivoted her strategy. "I just wanted to discuss some... compensation. Nothing more," she said, feigning innocence.

Ethan, determined to shield Olivia from any unnecessary stress, reluctantly agreed to discuss terms elsewhere, leading Emily to a nearby café. Emily, mistaking his intentions, believed she was winning Ethan over.

In the café, Emily tried every charm she had, but Ethan remained indifferent, his mind solely on protecting Olivia. When Emily proposed an absurd deal involving Ethan modeling for her fledgling clothing brand, he decided to play along, if only to get her off Olivia's back.

"Alright," Ethan said, leaning in with a smirk that promised nothing. "Let's talk terms."

Emily, misreading his interest, eagerly laid out her proposal, convinced that she had successfully roped Ethan into her scheme. But Ethan was already planning his next move, ensuring that whatever Emily had in mind would backfire spectacularly, all in the name of keeping Olivia out of harm's way.
