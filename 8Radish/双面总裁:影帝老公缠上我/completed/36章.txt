Olivia Stewart turned around, driven by pure curiosity, to see her friend Emily sitting on the floor, clutching her chest, her face as pale as a ghost.

"Emily, what happened?" Olivia asked, rushing over and setting her tray aside to help her up.

With tears streaming down her face, Emily pointed a trembling finger at the guy wearing sunglasses. "He... he actually used a barbell..."

Just as her upper body was about to lean in close to this guy in a way that would make any man’s heart race, he had pushed the barbell up, sending her flying!

And it hit her right in her pride and joy!

Olivia finally understood and glanced at the guy in sunglasses. He stood up from the bench press as if nothing had happened, his voice cold and deep, "Slipped."

That voice... it sounded oddly familiar.

Olivia frowned, trying to remember, but Emily's wailing interrupted her thoughts.

"Emily, it's okay. I'm sure it was an accident. Let's get you to the nurse's office," Olivia said, trying to calm her down. But secretly, she felt a strange sense of satisfaction knowing not all guys were bewitched by Emily’s charms.

A flamboyant guy appeared out of nowhere, wrapping his arm around Emily. "You just take care of our boss. I'll help her out."

As Olivia turned her attention back to the guy in sunglasses, she noticed him watching her. She couldn’t see his expression through the shades, but his gaze made her uncomfortable, like he could see right through her.

This guy was strange, always wearing sunglasses, even while working out. Maybe he was blind? But then, how could a blind man stare at her like that?

Thinking about how he had dealt with Emily made Olivia nervous. She wanted to leave but was afraid of upsetting an important client and losing her job. So she flashed a polite smile and made an excuse to slip away. "Sir, I'm sorry. Maybe I can get you another trainer?"

Emily usually didn’t allow other trainers around when she dealt with big clients.

The guy gestured for her to come over without saying a word.

"Uh... I’m not trained to spot anyone."

Ignoring her, he moved to another piece of equipment, lay down, and pointed at the belt.

Olivia hesitated. She might not know how to spot, but she couldn’t say she didn’t know how to fasten a belt. So, she took a deep breath and went over.

Jobs in a place like this weren’t easy to come by, and she didn’t want to lose hers.

Olivia leaned over him, carefully fastening the safety belt across his waist. She was always meticulous with clients, though not with the same ulterior motives as Emily.

"Sir, it's all set!"

Just as she was about to stand up, her foot accidentally caught his, sending her tumbling onto him.

"Ugh..."

Before she knew it, she landed right on top of him, their lips accidentally meeting.

Olivia sprang up, her face blazing red. "I-I’m so sorry!"

Emily had been thrown off with just a nudge, and here she was, kissing the guy. She feared being tossed out the window herself.

The corner of the sunglasses guy's mouth curled slightly as he undid the belt and sat up.

Olivia stood nervously to the side, staring at her shoes.

Seeing he wasn’t angry, she cautiously suggested, "Uh, sir, if you’re tired, maybe you’d like to sit down? Oh, and I got your milk."

He glanced at the tray on the ground before walking off. Olivia quickly grabbed the tray and followed him.

In one corner of the gym was a small lounge area for guests to relax.

Olivia set the tray on the coffee table. "Here's the milk you wanted."

The guy looked up at her, his eyes twinkling with amusement.

Not knowing what else to do, Olivia began introducing each drink. "This is yogurt, this is whole milk, date milk, breakfast milk, high-calcium milk... I wasn’t sure which brand or flavor you liked, so I got a little of everything."

She realized halfway through that he wasn’t paying attention to her words but was instead focused on her lips as she spoke.

Was she being too eager?

Thinking about Emily's situation, Olivia quickly stopped talking and moved to stand up. The guy suddenly reached out, using a napkin to wipe the sweat from her nose.

Uh...

Olivia was stunned.

Then he moved the napkin towards her forehead.

Snapping out of it, she awkwardly took the napkin from him. "Thanks, I-I can do it myself! It’s just a bit warm today, and I overdressed."

His lips curled again into a faint smile.

A while later, the flamboyant guy returned, helping a shaky Emily back in.

Emily had a large bruise across her chest, and she leaned heavily on the flamboyant guy.

The sunglasses guy, unexpectedly generous, motioned to a chair across from him for Emily to sit.

Emily, surprised and flattered, quickly sat down, forcing a smile despite the pain.

The sunglasses guy gave a subtle nod to the flamboyant guy, who immediately spoke up. "After our boss’s assessment, your gym is... well, decent. But since our boss accidentally injured this lovely lady, as an apology, we’d like to sign up for a VIP membership and choose a personal trainer."

Emily’s face lit up with joy.

"As for the personal trainer," the flamboyant guy paused, glancing at the sunglasses guy, "since our boss’s schedule is unpredictable, the trainer must be available exclusively for him, anytime and anywhere. Of course, the pay is ten times your top trainer's rate, calculated on a 24-hour basis."

Emily nodded eagerly, her face beaming, seemingly forgetting her earlier mishap.

"Well then," the flamboyant guy turned to the sunglasses guy, "would you like to choose your trainer?"

The sunglasses guy nodded slightly. Emily quickly jumped in, "Sir, would you consider me? I'm the best trainer here, which is why I’m the manager, right?"

Olivia struggled to suppress a giggle, knowing full well how Emily had managed her "business volume."

Seeing the sunglasses guy remain silent, Emily hesitated, "Or, I could call over the other trainers for you to choose from?"

Even if she wasn’t chosen, as manager, she’d still earn a hefty commission.

The sunglasses guy suddenly pointed at Olivia.

"Uh, no, I’m just a..."

"Olivia!" Emily interrupted, pulling her aside. "Don’t be stupid!"

"But I’m just a drink server!" Olivia protested.

"Go grab a trainer badge from my office. From now on, you’re a coach!"

"But I don’t know anything about fitness training!"

"Just make him use every piece of equipment. He’ll get a workout that way!"

"But..."

"No buts! This is a big fish, and we can’t let him get away!"

Seeing Olivia’s reluctance, Emily softened her tone, "Don’t worry. I’ve got your back. Just agree for now. If he finds you lacking, we can switch you out later. Olivia, my dear, if you land this, the entire commission is yours!"

Olivia thought for a moment before nodding.

Emily felt a pang of loss but knew she could reel in this big fish and hook him for good.

Returning to the table, the flamboyant guy pushed a contract towards them. "If you’re ready, just sign here."

Emily, afraid they might change their minds, quickly signed without reading, then nudged Olivia to do the same.

"Why do I need to sign?" Olivia asked, puzzled.

"Didn’t you hear them say the commission is all yours? You have to sign!"

Emily’s face turned sour, but she nodded stiffly.

Olivia reluctantly signed her name.

The flamboyant guy packed away the contract, grinning brightly. "Congratulations, Olivia, on becoming our boss’s personal trainer. Oh, and I forgot to mention, your pay is a hundred times your gold trainer's rate!"

"What?"

Both Olivia and Emily were stunned.

Clients who spent this much were unheard of!

Emily nearly knelt before the sunglasses guy, urging Olivia, her voice shaking with excitement, "Olivia, hurry and get your badge. Remember, the customer is always right!"

Olivia felt uneasy about the whole thing, like she was selling herself, but with Emily’s constant urging, she reluctantly went to get her badge, hoping the client would soon want a replacement trainer.

As she made her way back, she was met with envious glances and congratulatory remarks from everyone.

As she returned, the flamboyant guy beamed. "Our boss is waiting for you in the car!"

Olivia approached to see a sleek red sports car, a bit skeptical. Once inside, the man slowly removed his sunglasses, and Olivia gasped, "It's you?"
