**The Twin Storms**

Isabella Peterson was a force to be reckoned with, her presence commanding respect effortlessly. Olivia Stewart, nestled in her embrace, had eyes that sparkled with a beauty so striking it was almost otherworldly. The men in black blocking their path hesitated, unnerved by Isabella's fierce aura, stepping back instinctively.

As Isabella and Olivia moved forward, the men retreated until they couldn't anymore. The leader of the group, with a resigned sigh, muttered, "Apologies, but we have orders," before launching a punch with surprising speed.

Olivia instinctively shrank further into Isabella's arms, her eyes wide with fear. The politeness of the words did nothing to soften the attack.

Isabella stood her ground, eyes cold and calculating as the fist came toward her. Just before impact, she tilted her head, narrowly dodging the blow, and retaliated with a swift knee to the man's stomach.

A pained grunt escaped the man as he doubled over, shock and disbelief written all over his face. He never expected such a move from someone of Isabella's standing.

While he was incapacitated, Olivia regained her composure. With a quick swipe of her nails, she left five deep scratches on the man's face. The man howled in pain, his face a grotesque mask of blood and fury.

"Get them!" he yelled frantically, trying to rally his companions. "Especially that woman with him!"

But the others hesitated, unnerved by the display.

Olivia, feeling rather pleased with herself, shouted, "Come on, if you're not afraid of losing something important, I'll kick you right where it hurts!"

Isabella shot her a stern look. "Quiet," he hissed. If it weren't for the need to protect her, he wouldn't have resorted to such tactics.

Olivia, chastised but unperturbed, brandished her nails proudly. "No worries! My claws leave marks that'll make sure you won't even get a date, let alone a family!"

Isabella sighed, thinking she was getting a bit carried away. Their success had been due to surprise, not skill, and he knew they couldn't rely on that again.

He whispered, "Enough."

Olivia nodded, adopting Isabella's serious demeanor and raising her hands in a defensive stance. The men in black flinched, one even stumbling backward onto the grass.

Olivia's laughter rang out. "You're all pathetic!"

Isabella wasn't amused. These were the Peterson family's guards, after all, and their failure reflected poorly on him.

Sensing Isabella's displeasure, Olivia muffled her laughter, realizing the impact of her actions.

A slow clap echoed from behind the men in black. Olivia and Isabella turned to see Alexander Peterson emerging, his face a mask of false sincerity.

Olivia glared at him, mentally flipping him off. If she'd ever felt guilty about anything involving him, that was gone now. He'd orchestrated everything, playing both savior and villain.

Alexander approached, adjusting his glasses with a smile that made Olivia's skin crawl. "Impressive," he said. "Olivia, you're quite clever."

His gaze was warm, too warm, and Olivia felt the urge to roll her eyes. She didn't need this kind of praise, especially not from him.

She glanced at Isabella, who looked anything but pleased. The arm around her waist tightened, a sign of his own unease.

"Olivia Stewart is what you call her?" Isabella's voice was cold.

Olivia turned to him, surprised to see a hint of a smile. "Call me big brother," Isabella instructed.

Warmth spread through Olivia at his words. He trusted her.

"Hello, big brother!" she chirped, her voice sweet and clear.

Alexander's expression faltered. He'd hoped to drive a wedge between them, but his plan had backfired.

"Isabella has a fianc√©e," Alexander reminded them, trying to regain control.

"I know," Olivia replied, unbothered. "We've met. She doesn't matter."

Alexander was taken aback. "You hate being a third wheel."

Olivia shrugged. "She's irrelevant. The engagement was arranged, and she means nothing here."

Isabella wrapped an arm around Olivia. "Let's go."

"Wait," Alexander called, but faltered under Isabella's icy glare. "You should stay. I've spoken to the family. Olivia can stay with you, as long as she stays out of sight."

Olivia looked at him skeptically. "The family listens to you?"

Isabella laughed humorlessly. "In this house, if anyone can sway the old man, it's Alexander."

Alexander flinched at the implication but plastered on a smile. "Stay a while," he urged.

Olivia remained skeptical. Was there more to this than met the eye?
