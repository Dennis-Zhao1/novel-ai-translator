Sudden Gastric Bleeding

"Old man Wright! Have you lost your mind? How many times have I told you, Olivia Stewart is sensitive. If we’re not downstairs, no one should just come up here. You're too old to be seeing things you shouldn’t. Aren’t you embarrassed?"

Lucas Wright deftly dodged the pillow aimed at him, protecting the bowl of soup in his hands. "Master..."

"Whether you're embarrassed or not isn’t the point. If Olivia Stewart gets upset and won't let me near her, can you afford that?"

Lucas Wright listened, shaking his head helplessly. It seemed the young master was still drunk!

After Isabella Peterson finished venting, Lucas Wright approached with the soup, speaking softly, "Master, you should drink this hangover soup."

"What hangover soup at this hour?" Isabella Peterson waved it off, but as soon as he sat up, he felt as if his head had been split open with an axe. He couldn’t help but press his fingers to his temples, frowning deeply.

Lucas Wright, realizing it was the aftereffects of a hangover, quickly brought the soup to his lips.

Without even looking, Isabella Peterson downed it in one go, not bothering to wipe his mouth before asking, "Where's Olivia Stewart?"

"Olivia Stewart... she's not home, so I came up to take care of you."

"Not home..."

Isabella Peterson rubbed his temples, something flickering in his mind, and then his expression slowly changed.

Right, he himself had told Olivia Stewart to leave. How could she still be here?

But seeing her with another man, kissing so passionately, what was he supposed to do?

It was like a thorn in his heart; even if it hurt, it had to be removed.

Isabella Peterson gazed out the window, his eyes as lost as a child who couldn’t find their way home.

Lucas Wright felt a pang of compassion. "Master, would you like something to eat?"

Isabella Peterson answered with a question, "What time is it?"

"It's already evening. You slept from dawn until now because of last night's drinking."

"Oh right, I asked you to deliver something to Olivia Stewart. Where is it?"

Suddenly, Isabella Peterson grabbed Lucas Wright by the collar, staring intently at him.

"Master, don't worry. I already delivered it."

"What? You gave it to her?" Isabella Peterson's voice rose several octaves, his eyebrows shooting up.

Lucas Wright was bewildered by his shouting. Wasn’t he the one who had asked for it to be delivered overnight? What was wrong with that?

"You old fool! Who told you to give it to her?"

Facing Isabella Peterson’s rage, Lucas Wright didn’t dare lift his head, his voice trembling, "Master, didn’t you—didn’t you tell me to deliver it last night?"

"She doesn’t live there anymore, so why deliver it? Didn’t I tell you not to disturb her?" Isabella Peterson’s voice continued to thunder in Lucas Wright’s ear, and if not for the old man's age, he felt like throwing him out the window.

Lucas Wright felt utterly helpless.

So what Isabella Peterson meant by "do not disturb" was this!

He thought the master meant to wait until Olivia Stewart was awake to deliver it. But...

"S-sorry, Master!" Lucas Wright hung his head, flooded with guilt, cold sweat dripping down.

Seeing his pitiful look, Isabella Peterson released him with a cold hand, asking, "Did she accept it?"

"Yes, Master!"

Thinking quickly, Lucas Wright presented a wooden box, "But Olivia Stewart returned this box. She said it was too valuable to accept."

Isabella Peterson clenched the box tightly, his fingers turning white. He didn’t shout or scowl, just maintained a tense, dark expression.

Suddenly, with a flick of his wrist, the box flew through the air, hitting the wall with a crash and shattering into pieces.

The priceless antique box lay in ruins.

Lucas Wright couldn’t help but recall how Isabella Peterson had gone to great lengths to obtain it from a temple, his heart heavy with emotion.

"Master, don’t be angry. When I delivered the bracelet, I only saw Olivia Stewart alone. Maybe there’s some misunderstanding between you two..."

"Don’t mention her to me!"

Isabella Peterson shouted, then clutched his stomach, his face twisted with pain as he crouched down. Soon, cold sweat beaded on his forehead.

"Master! Master!"

Lucas Wright was frantic, immediately ringing for the downstairs staff and doctor.

Everyone rushed to get Isabella Peterson onto the bed. After a quick examination, the family doctor looked worried, "The Master likely has acute gastritis from prolonged fasting and excessive drinking. The situation is serious; I recommend immediate hospitalization."

Lucas Wright was about to arrange transportation when Isabella Peterson stopped him, "I’m not going! I won’t die!"

Even in pain, he was stubborn!

Worried and anxious, Lucas Wright instinctively wanted to call Olivia Stewart, but just as he turned, Isabella Peterson’s hoarse voice stopped him, "If anyone dares tell Olivia Stewart, I’ll destroy them!"

Hearing this weak but fierce roar, Lucas Wright turned back, filled with concern, "Master, why put yourself through this?"

Isabella Peterson was as stubborn as a child, "This is my business, not yours! Everyone out!"

They all left the room. The family doctor stopped Lucas Wright, looking worried, "The Master’s condition is serious. We must find a way to get him to the hospital soon, or there may be irreversible consequences."

Lucas Wright nodded heavily, "Prepare all emergency measures and have David Wright ready the car. I’ll try again!"

Returning to Isabella Peterson’s room, Lucas Wright found him curled up in bed, clutching his stomach like a large lobster.

But now wasn’t the time to worry about appearances.

Lucas Wright steeled himself, crouching in front of Isabella Peterson, "Master, are you refusing to go to the hospital because you regret driving Olivia Stewart away and are using this pain to punish yourself?"

Isabella Peterson turned, giving him a feeble side-eye, "Shut up! Get out!"

"Master, forgive my rudeness. If you don’t go to the hospital, I’ll call Olivia Stewart right now!"

"You dare threaten me!"

Isabella Peterson gritted his teeth, but his defiance lacked energy, like a toothless old tiger.

Lucas Wright pressed on, "I am threatening you, Master. You have one minute to decide!"

"Fine, I’ll go!"

In less than a second, Isabella Peterson agreed. He didn’t want Olivia Stewart to worry or see him so defeated and pathetic!

Lucas Wright quickly signaled for the waiting doctor and bodyguards to help Isabella Peterson out the door.

At the hospital, after an examination, it was confirmed—acute gastric bleeding!

Isabella Peterson lay in the hospital room, an IV in his hand, his pale face looking even more chiseled and stern. His dark eyes stared out the window, deep as a silent pool.

Lucas Wright stood by, "Master, perhaps we should return to the Peterson family estate. They have a specialized medical team for the best treatment."

"You dare!" Isabella Peterson snapped at Lucas Wright, "If the old man finds out about this, you’ll be responsible!"

For the old man who had raised him, Isabella Peterson had never spoken so harshly. But this time, his face carried a rare severity, his tone unusually serious.

Acute gastric bleeding!

Returning home with such a serious condition, the old man would inquire, and once he did, he'd uncover everything tied to Olivia Stewart. Knowing his grandfather's temper...

Isabella Peterson didn’t dare think further, resolutely cutting off that possibility.

Lucas Wright understood the implications, nodding solemnly, "Yes, Master."

Isabella Peterson turned his gaze back to the window, unfocused.

Lucas Wright, unable to bear it, suggested, "Should I ask Olivia Stewart to come care for you?"

"No!" Isabella Peterson almost instinctively refused.

After speaking, he glanced at Lucas Wright, who stood obediently, not making any move to call Olivia Stewart.

This old man, telling him not to call and he really doesn’t? So honest!

Frustrated but unable to express it, Isabella Peterson sulked, refusing water and food, complaining about everything—nothing was right, everything was uncomfortable!

Lucas Wright, after caring for Isabella Peterson for over twenty years, was baffled. Everything was according to the young master’s preferences, so why was nothing right anymore? Had his tastes changed so much after just a few months with Olivia Stewart?

Meanwhile, Olivia Stewart was completely unaware of Isabella Peterson’s drinking and resultant acute gastric bleeding. Knowing he’d be absent from the set for a few days, she enjoyed the unexpected break.

Ethan King finally found Olivia Stewart at a small hotel on the third day. With no connections in the city, he had searched each street, hotel by hotel.

When Olivia Stewart opened the door and saw Ethan King, exhausted and leaning against the doorframe, his eyes hollowed from fatigue, her eyelashes grew damp.

"Ethan King, you..."

Propping himself against the door, Ethan King’s face showed layers of exhaustion and the joy of reunion, "Olivia Stewart, don’t rush to kick me out. Let me rest for a moment!"

His voice was hoarse, tinged with a pleading note.

"Ethan King, why put yourself through this?"

Olivia Stewart sighed, and despite the potential for gossip, she let Ethan King into her room.

The room was tiny and cramped, just a bed and a nightstand, nothing more.

Ethan King glanced around, feeling a pang in his heart, "Olivia Stewart, I’m sorry!"

Opening his mouth, it felt like his throat was stuffed with cotton, his chest tight with unspoken words.
