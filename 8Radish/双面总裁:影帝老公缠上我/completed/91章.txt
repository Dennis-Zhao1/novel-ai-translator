Olivia Stewart was lounging on her balcony, engrossed in a book about acting. She didn't even glance up when Isabella Peterson burst onto the scene, her voice brimming with excitement. "Olivia, I've got an idea!" Isabella declared, practically vibrating with enthusiasm.

Olivia, still absorbed in her book, replied with a distracted hum, "Hmm?"

Not one to be ignored, Isabella swiftly closed the distance between them, snatching the book from Olivia's hands and repeating herself with a dramatic flair, "I've got a solution for your problem!"

Olivia blinked in confusion, "What problem?"

With a triumphant grin, Isabella announced, "You can't sweat from your face, right? So, just cover it with an ice mask!"

Olivia's cheeks flushed a deep red as the realization hit her. "Isabella, are you serious? An ice mask on my face?"

"Absolutely," Isabella replied, her eyes gleaming with a mischievous sparkle. She seemed proud of her clever idea, as if she'd just solved a complex puzzle.

Olivia internally rolled her eyes. "Are you really okay with kissing someone with an ice mask on their face? It's like kissing a zombie!"

"Nonsense!" Isabella retorted, gently tapping Olivia's forehead. "You could never be mistaken for a zombie."

Despite her friend's reassurances, Olivia couldn't help but feel a twinge of doubt. Was Isabella so fixated on her face that she'd toss her aside if it ever changed?

Determined to keep things light, Isabella scooped Olivia into her arms, nuzzling her neck affectionately. "You have no idea how much I want you," she murmured.

Olivia's heart skipped a beat at the unexpected confession. It was as if someone had tugged at her heartstrings, leaving her feeling both elated and anxious.

She decided to ignore the part about wanting, focusing instead on the emotion behind Isabella's words. At least for now, she had this moment.

As Isabella carried her back inside, she called out for Lucas Wright to bring up a dozen ice masks, only to be reminded by Lucas that Olivia was supposed to avoid any skincare products for a while.

"Well, great," Isabella muttered, heading for a cold shower to cool off her frustration.

Left alone, Olivia adjusted her clothes and felt a pang of insecurity. Was Isabella really so concerned about her appearance? Still, she resolved to take care of herself, not just for him but for her own sake.

Determined to be proactive, Olivia sought advice from their family doctor, jotting down every precaution she needed to follow.

Meanwhile, Isabella was left to endure a monk-like existence, constantly yearning for Olivia but never crossing the line. He was always around, offering hugs and kisses, yet stopping short of anything more, claiming it was to quench his thirst like a parched traveler.

For Olivia, life wasn't much easier. Isabella stuck to her like glue, and her diet was strictly controlled, avoiding anything with artificial colors or spices. Even snacks were off-limits, much to Olivia's dismay. Despite her love for spicy and fried foods, she diligently adhered to the regimen.

Isabella watched her with a knowing look. "Eager to heal up quickly, huh?"

"Of course," Olivia replied, rolling her eyes. "Who wants to walk around with a face that's not up to par?"

"Exactly! Once you're better, you can sweat all you want!" Isabella teased, earning a playful punch from Olivia.

"Can't you think about anything else?" she asked, exasperated.

"Nope!" Isabella declared confidently. "One day, I'll make up for all of this."

Olivia couldn't help but laugh, though a part of her wondered if she'd survive Isabella's enthusiasm once she was fully recovered.

A few days later, the academy called to apologize to Olivia. The dean personally assured her that Sarah Moore, who'd caused trouble, had been expelled. Olivia couldn't help but suspect Isabella's influence in the matter.

"Didn't I say I could handle it myself?" she sighed, looking at Isabella.

"My girl got hurt. I needed to make it right," Isabella replied, unrepentant.

"But Sarah's already suffered enough," Olivia pointed out. "Isn't expulsion a bit harsh?"

"Harsh? Olivia, if your face was damaged and it affected your career, who would you blame?"

Olivia paused, realizing Isabella had a point. She wasn't one to hold grudges, but she couldn't deny the truth in his words.

Isabella's grip on Olivia's chin drew her attention back to him. "Mess up that pretty face again, and you'll be answering to me."

Olivia met his gaze, feeling a mix of gratitude and annoyance. "Is my face really that important to you?"

"Obviously."

"And you really want me to succeed in acting?"

"Absolutely."

"Alright, I understand," Olivia replied, releasing a small sigh as she turned to head upstairs.

Isabella watched her go, slightly perplexed but determined to support her in any way he could.

Later, as Isabella dealt with a minor crisis at one of their construction sites, he couldn't help but feel the weight of his responsibilities contrasting with his desire to be more present for Olivia. Yet, he knew that in protecting her, he was doing what he believed was right.

Back in their shared space, Olivia continued to navigate her healing journey, all while Isabella remained her steadfast, albeit occasionally overbearing, companion.
