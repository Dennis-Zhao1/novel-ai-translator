One day in the sprawling halls of the Peterson estate, Olivia Stewart found herself in a rather awkward situation. As she was about to enter Isabella Peterson's study, she heard a deep, slightly annoyed voice command, "Get out!" 

Olivia, caught off guard, quickly apologized, "Sorry, sorry! I didn't see anything!" as she covered her eyes and backed out of the room. But just as she reached the door, she spun around again, still shielding her face with her hands. "Isabella, um, could you put on a shirt first? I need to talk to you!"

Inside, Isabella Peterson stood bare-chested, holding a shirt in her hand. With an amused smirk, she gestured for Olivia to come closer. Olivia hesitated, peeking through her fingers at Isabella's impressive physique. Even though she’d seen him in gym clothes before, this was a whole new level. The sight made her heart race, and she couldn't help but think, "Wow, this guy's got a killer body!" 

Trying to suppress her inner fangirl, Olivia approached slowly, stopping a few steps away. Isabella, with a playful look in her eyes, walked over and gently pried Olivia's fingers away from her face. "Did you enjoy the view?" Isabella teased.

Olivia felt her face flush with heat. Pointing awkwardly at the clothes in Isabella's hand, she stammered, "Um, well, who would’ve guessed you’d be, uh, shirtless in the study..."

Seeing her flustered expression, Isabella chuckled and lightly tapped her head. "Relax, I just spilled some coffee and needed to change. You barged in before I had the chance. Were you hoping for this?"

"No, no, definitely not!" Olivia waved her hands frantically, her eyes darting away from Isabella's toned chest.

"I actually came to ask you if Alyssa could come back to work at the castle. She's not cut out for the hard labor outside," Olivia explained, trying to steer the conversation back to safer ground.

Isabella's demeanor shifted slightly, her voice tinged with a cold edge. "Why should I care about that?"

Olivia hesitated, knowing she had no real right to interfere. "Alyssa got into trouble because of me. I feel responsible."

Isabella rolled her eyes, frustrated. "And you think you can fix this?"

Olivia nodded earnestly, looking up at Isabella with hopeful eyes, silently pleading for his understanding.

Isabella sighed, his irritation softening. "You know, you’re always getting me into trouble. When are you going to fix that?"

"Uh?" Olivia was taken aback, not quite sure how to respond.

"Olivia Stewart! Out!" Isabella commanded, his patience finally running out.

Feeling thoroughly embarrassed, Olivia made a hasty retreat. But later that afternoon, Alyssa returned to the castle, resuming her role as Olivia's personal maid, much to Olivia's relief. She greeted Alyssa with a bright smile, "Alyssa, you're back! That's fantastic!"

Alyssa bowed slightly. "Thank you, Olivia, for speaking on my behalf. Which robe would you like me to prepare for tonight?"

"Oh, any one will do. You decide!" Olivia replied nonchalantly, missing the fleeting shadow that crossed Alyssa's face.

As the day wore on and evening approached, Olivia realized it was time to leave. Heading downstairs, she called out, "Hey, Lucas, can you arrange a car for me? I'm done for the day!"

But as she reached the bottom of the stairs, she caught sight of Isabella lounging on the sofa. Her heart skipped a beat, and in her momentary panic, she missed a step and tumbled onto the carpet.

"Olivia, are you okay?" Lucas Wright rushed to help her up.

"Yeah, I'm fine," Olivia mumbled, trying to regain her composure. "Just my luck, tripping over nothing."

"Come over here," Isabella's deep voice called out, his face unreadable.

Olivia hesitated, remembering his aversion to dirt and disorder. But his commanding gaze left her no choice, and she reluctantly sat down beside him.

Isabella leaned over, gently testing her ankle. "Does it hurt?"

"Not really..." Olivia began, but when Isabella applied a bit more pressure, she yelped, "Ow, Isabella! That hurts!"

Isabella released her ankle and instructed Lucas, "Bring the first-aid kit."

Turning back to Olivia, he added with a teasing smirk, "Next time, try not to scream so loudly. People might get the wrong idea about me."

Olivia blushed furiously, muttering under her breath about his supposed reputation.

Isabella tended to her ankle with care, though his movements were slightly awkward. Olivia watched him, curious. "Isabella, have you ever done this before?"

"Of course not," he replied, slightly offended. "I'm not usually giving foot massages."

As he continued, Olivia couldn't shake a feeling of bittersweet warmth. She knew Isabella's kindness wasn't truly meant for her—it was for someone else, someone she reminded him of. The realization stung, but she pushed it down, focusing on the present.

"Isabella, I'm fine now. Can I go home?" Olivia asked softly.

Isabella paused, then continued his work with more intensity. "You really want to leave and see that guy?"

"We're just friends," Olivia insisted. "Besides, you know he's not into women."

Isabella chuckled under his breath, unconvinced.

"You remember the contract, right? You’re supposed to be with me 24/7," Isabella reminded her.

"That's ridiculous! Nobody does that. You can't expect me to follow you around all day," Olivia protested. "And what about when you sleep?"

"I don't mind," Isabella responded, unfazed.

"But I do!" Olivia retorted. "I’m used to my own place. And you share that apartment with us, remember?"

"The place is too cramped. I can't sleep well there," Isabella declared flatly.

Olivia muttered, "Then why do you insist on staying there?"

"What was that?" Isabella asked.

"Nothing. My foot feels a lot better now, thank you," Olivia replied sheepishly.

Isabella released her foot, stood up, and went upstairs, leaving Olivia to ponder his mood.

Lucas came over, gathering the first-aid kit. "Olivia, why don't you stay for dinner? The master has been planning it for a while."

"Okay," Olivia agreed, glancing at her ankle which still felt warm from Isabella's touch.

When Isabella returned, dressed in fresh clothes, Olivia sighed inwardly. His cleanliness was almost comical, but she couldn't deny it was endearing in its own way.

Dinner was set in the castle's crystal dining room, a place Olivia adored. The floor was a transparent wonder, with colorful fish swimming beneath. She bounced around happily, causing ripples to form beneath her feet. "Isabella, I love this place! It's magical!"

Isabella's voice was soft but carried a hint of mischief. "I like it too. Someone had quite the adventure here once."

Olivia was momentarily speechless, her cheeks turning red. Isabella had a knack for ruining the mood with his teasing remarks, reminding her of past near-mishaps in the castle’s many rooms.

As they sat down to a sumptuous meal, the atmosphere was a little tense. Olivia usually enjoyed chatting during meals, but Isabella's composed demeanor made her focus on her food instead.

Just as they began eating, a noise from outside caught their attention, someone was calling for Olivia.

Both of them put down their utensils simultaneously and exchanged a look of confusion and concern. "What's going on?" Olivia wondered aloud, while Isabella simply muttered, "Lunatic."

And with that, the peaceful dinner turned into a mystery that needed unraveling.
