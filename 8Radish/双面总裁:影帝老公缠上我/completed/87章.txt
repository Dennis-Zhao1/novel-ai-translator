Two Pups in Love

Acting class—a course that film school students both look forward to and dread. It's fun and filled with laughter, but the teachers have a knack for assigning the most bizarre roles, often leaving students in fits of laughter or tears. One wrong move, and you might just flunk.

It was Olivia Stewart's first day in acting class, and she felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. Her desk mate, Sophie Cook, leaned over and whispered, "The acting assignments are random, and partners are chosen on the spot. But beware, the teachers come up with the most unexpected scenarios."

As if on cue, Mr. Hu, their acting teacher with a full beard, glided into the room with a comical flourish and a dramatic shrug. "Ladies and gentlemen, the sun is shining, the air is fresh. What say we take this class to the great outdoors?"

"Yeah!" The students erupted in cheers.

Soon, they gathered on the expansive lawn, sitting in small groups, wondering what unusual challenges Mr. Hu had in store for them. He stood at the center, cleared his throat, and asked, "Looking at all this lush green grass, what does it make you think of?"

"I want to lie down and nap!"

"I want to roll around!"

"I want to chat with my girlfriend!"

The students buzzed with lively discussion. Mr. Hu just smiled, waiting for them to quiet down, and then posed a seemingly unrelated question: "Doesn't anyone feel like munching on this fresh grass?"

"Come on! I'm not a pig!"

Mr. Hu slowly pulled out a small jar filled with slips of paper from his pocket. He gestured to the student who had spoken. "Well said! You get the first pick."

The student, nicknamed Chubby, reluctantly picked a slip from the jar. As he read it, his face turned crimson. According to tradition, each student had to read their assignment aloud and could invite a partner if needed. But Chubby just stood there, speechless.

Finally, Mr. Hu prompted, "Are you going to forfeit and fail the class?"

Panicking, Chubby blurted out, "A pig eating grass!"

The class exploded with laughter. Some students were doubled over, others were rolling on the grass, and a few were actually crying with laughter. Olivia couldn't help but join in.

Poor Chubby! Was it bad luck or Mr. Hu's mischief? To mention a pig and then draw the pig role—what were the odds?

Chubby's face flushed even more. Mr. Hu stroked his beard, amused. "Begin!"

Chubby had no choice. He got on all fours, mimicking a pig, snorting a few times before pretending to chew on the grass. His expression was priceless.

The laughter roared again. Olivia clutched her stomach, tears of mirth streaming down her face. You had to hand it to Chubby—his pig impersonation was spot-on, a testament to his acting skills.

"Pass," Mr. Hu declared with a wave, and Chubby spat out the grass with relief.

Mr. Hu held up his jar. "Next up..."

"Two goats fighting!"

More laughter ensued, and with each new performance, the lawn was filled with cheers and howls. It dawned on everyone—this was a zoo-themed class. Every student had to act out an animal.

Horses, cows, sheep, pigs, chickens—each role was taken. The easiest was the crocodile, who simply lay still, giving Mr. Hu a lazy side-eye before squeezing out a single tear to pass.

After laughing so much, Olivia leaned back on the grass, a little anxious. What would her role be? A snake? A bear? A squirrel?

Lost in thought, Olivia watched the next student take the stage. He was tall, handsome, and unfortunately notorious for his smelly feet, earning him the nickname "Stinky Feet."

Standing in the middle of the group, Stinky Feet didn't rush to read his slip. Instead, he scanned the crowd. "This role needs two people. I'd like a partner."

The students fell silent, each avoiding eye contact. No one wanted to volunteer for another animal act.

Stinky Feet's gaze landed on Olivia. "Olivia Stewart, would you like to partner with me?"

Called out in front of everyone, Olivia couldn't very well refuse. She stood up slowly, asking, "What's the assignment?"

Stinky Feet smiled, "Come over, and you'll find out."

Sophie Cook nudged Olivia, whispering, "No one's ever asked you before. This could be your chance to bond with everyone. Plus, a great actor should be up for any challenge."

"I know," Olivia replied, biting her lip. "Alright, I'll partner with you."

Stinky Feet finally read the slip, "Two puppies in love on the grass!"

The laughter that erupted had a different tone this time. The guys, in particular, exchanged mischievous glances. Everyone knew what puppy love looked like in the park during springtime.

Olivia felt a twinge of regret. Why hadn't she asked for details first?

Stinky Feet grinned, "You lay down first, then I'll join."

Olivia felt queasy but forced a smile, giving him a warning look. "Why don't we act out the first meeting instead?"

Stinky Feet hesitated but agreed. If Olivia walked away, he'd be stuck.

They crouched face-to-face on the grass, a couple of steps apart.

"Olivia, I've brought a bone from the hotel. Try it!" Stinky Feet said, pulling off his shoe and offering it. The stench was overpowering, and the crowd backed up, pinching their noses.

Olivia held her breath, moving back slightly. She noticed Stinky Feet's sly smile and felt a surge of defiance. Two could play at that game.

Olivia's gaze caught something in the grass—a fresh pile of dog poop. Perfect.

Feigning sweetness, she said, "I'm teething and can't chew bones. But I've got a treat for you too!"

Using a large leaf, she scraped the poop into his shoe and handed it back. "Here, a fresh, delicious cake for you!"

"You... ugh!" Stinky Feet stared at his shoe, turning green before running off to the side, retching.

And just like that, the role-playing class ended with a bang, leading into the next session: scene acting.

Scene acting was similar but with a twist. Scenarios and partners were random, requiring spontaneous dialogue to test both character understanding and improvisation skills.

Olivia was paired with Sarah Moore for the first scene, playing the roles of a mistress and a wife in a dramatic confrontation—familiar territory from countless soap operas.

Sarah, one of Sophie's best friends, chose the wife role, leaving Olivia as the mistress.

"You shameless woman! With so many men out there, why steal my husband?"

Sarah's insults grew harsher, even including some expletives. Olivia stared at her, her expression icy.

Was Sarah really that into character? Olivia doubted it. It seemed more like a chance to vent personal grievances.

Why take it lying down? Olivia wasn't one to back down from a fight.

Rolling up her sleeves, Olivia shot back, "You bitter old hag! No wonder your husband strays."

Olivia's sharp tongue unleashed a rapid-fire retort, words flowing without pause.

The two women clashed fiercely, like they truly were fighting over a man.

"How dare you? I'll teach you a lesson!" Sarah, unable to out-argue Olivia, swung her arm, aiming to slap her—

And that's where the story leaves off, in a whirlwind of laughter, rivalry, and unexpected alliances on the lively lawn of acting class.
