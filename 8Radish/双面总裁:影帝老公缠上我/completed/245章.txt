Title: "A Twist of Fate"

---

"At that moment in the locked room, when I fainted, it was Alexander Peterson who saved me."

"After waking up and realizing he hadn't taken advantage of me, I felt grateful to him."

"Plus, I had wronged him in the past, so along with gratitude, there was a tinge of guilt."

"Get to the point!" Isabella Peterson interrupted Olivia Stewart impatiently, fiddling with her fingers out of boredom. She wasn't interested in hearing about Olivia's messy past with Alexander Peterson.

"So, I stayed obediently by his side, waiting for you!"

Catching Isabella Peterson's narrowed gaze, Olivia quickly added, "Before you came, being by his side was the only way I felt safe!"

"Smart!" Isabella praised without hesitation, playfully nibbling Olivia's finger. A jolt of electricity shot through Olivia's body, making her blush and pull her hand back quickly.

"But when you finally arrived, all I got was a furious scolding!"

Her voice carried a mix of grievance and resentment.

Isabella's face showed a hint of embarrassment. "That's all in the past now. Why keep bringing it up? Enough foreplay—how exactly do you want me to give you a child? Are you thinking of adopting?"

"Let me be clear, if you're considering artificial insemination, that's a no-go!"

Olivia couldn't help but laugh.

"That day, when you knocked over the milk in anger and your assistant went to Alexander for medicine, I found out about your infertility."

"You knew all along?" Isabella asked quietly, her handsome face darkening.

Olivia teased, "Our mighty Isabella Peterson, lacking confidence for once? This must have hit you hard!"

Isabella shot her a look, "Try being in my shoes!"

Olivia sobered up, looking at Isabella intently, "What I mean is, I was pregnant before, remember? How can you be infertile?"

Isabella's eyes flickered, pressing her lips together. The implication was obvious: that child must be Alexander's.

"You don't trust me!" Olivia shouted in frustration, pinching Isabella's side hard.

Isabella winced, "It's not about trust. You don't remember what happened back then!"

Why she didn't remember, Isabella chose not to mention.

"Exactly, I don't remember. So, I asked Alexander if the child was his!"

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, staring at Olivia, afraid to miss even the slightest change in her expression.

"That night, I pushed him too far. He yelled at me, saying he never touched me!"

It was like a heavy hammer striking Isabella's mind. Fireworks danced in his deep, dark eyes.

"So, the child is mine? And you're mine too?"

"Yes, I've always been yours from start to finish!"

"Haha, we had a child, haha..."

Isabella laughed joyfully, pacing around the room. His usual cold demeanor was gone, replaced by a jubilant, almost giddy version of himself.

Olivia gave him a playful glare. "Look at how happy you are! At the end of the day, men want their woman to be a blank canvas, and they the sole artist!"

Isabella was still reveling in the thought, "Our child, hahaha..."

The child was still alive!

And it turned out to be his!

Thankfully, he'd planned to use the child to leverage Alexander, ordering the child to be found and brought back! Thankfully, he had no habit of harming children! Haha, it was his son after all!

Isabella couldn't stop smiling, contemplating the surprise he'd give Olivia once the child was found, but decided to keep it to himself for now.

Olivia watched his unrestrained delight with a mix of disdain and amusement, stomping her foot. "Look at you, so easily pleased!"

"Can you focus on what's important?"

"If we had a child back then, how can you be infertile now?"

His laughter abruptly stopped. Isabella's face froze in mid-laugh, looking a bit comical.

He was so happy, it made him dizzy!

Olivia glared at him with a hint of reproach. "Alexander said your body had issues for twenty years, and once you recovered, you partied too hard, causing more damage!"

"Shit!" Isabella cursed under his breath. "Don't listen to his nonsense! You know my capabilities better than anyone!"

Exactly because she knew, she had doubts!

Olivia silently grumbled, blushing as she changed the topic, "You refuse to take medicine, so Alexander asked me to ensure you do!"

"Didn't expect him to meddle this much! It's bad enough he covets the Peterson fortune; now he wants me childless too!"

A cold gleam flashed in Isabella's eyes. He pulled Olivia into his arms with a touch of possessiveness, "Don't worry about it. I'll handle it! Just stay by my side and keep away from that jerk!"

"But I saw the medicine he gave, it really is for treating infertility."

Isabella's brows furrowed deeply, forming a knot in the middle. Olivia quickly reached out to smooth it.

"Isabella, don't rush. Why not visit a big hospital for a check-up?"

"No!"

He refused outright. Too embarrassing, absolutely not!

"For our future happiness, can't you swallow your pride just once?"

"No!"

If there was an issue, they'd just not have more kids. After all, they had one already!

This was Isabella's thought process, though outwardly he reassured, "Alexander went to great lengths to fake records for my parents and force me to take medicine. Clearly, he's the problem, not me!"

Olivia nodded, "I thought the same, which is why I agreed to his persuasion, to come back and ensure you take the medicine."

Isabella's eyes narrowed, "Olivia, getting bold? Trying to trick me?"

She knew the situation yet encouraged him to visit the hospital!

"Uh…" Olivia averted her eyes guiltily, "I just wanted to see if you'd make a little sacrifice of your dignity for my happiness!"

"Want happiness, huh? I'll give you happiness right now!"

Isabella grabbed Olivia's head, capturing her soft lips with a fierce kiss...

Alexander never dreamed that his elaborate plan to sway Olivia would backfire. His efforts to send her to Isabella only cleared up their misunderstandings, rekindling their love.

For several days, Olivia continued to visit Alexander to collect the medicine. Alexander was always cautious, never giving the medicine directly to Olivia but mixing it into milk for her.

One day, holding a warm milk bottle, Olivia voiced her doubts, "Usually, we take medicine with water. Why does Isabella's medicine need milk? Doesn't milk interact with many drugs?"

Alexander's eyes flickered briefly. He adjusted his glasses to hide his unease, smiling gently like an older brother, "It's to care for Isabella's mood! He's been sickly since childhood, developing an eccentric personality. If he knew about the medicine's effects, he wouldn't drink it. That's why I mix it with his usual milk. Rest assured, this medicine won't react with milk."

His emphasis only made Olivia more suspicious. But she masked her thoughts well, maintaining a simple smile, "Really? That's great, thanks!"

This simple-minded woman was as gullible as ever!

Alexander's face briefly showed a cold sneer, his gentle demeanor hiding his sinister thoughts.

He continued to coax her, "Just ensure Isabella takes it for a week, and his condition will improve. Then, if you conceive, Grandpa won't stop you from marrying in."

Olivia blushed, fiddling shyly with her fingers. "But sneaking around to care for Isabella makes me uneasy. Brother, could you speak to Grandpa, let me stay by Isabella's side? Now that he knows his condition, he won't take medicine from anyone else!"

Brother?

His former girlfriend now a sister-in-law, haha!

Alexander mocked silently, clenching his fist. Even if Isabella stole his woman, it wouldn't matter! A week of medicine and he'd be infertile, beyond any cure!

When Olivia realized she had given him the sterilizing medicine herself, she'd surely come back to him!

The scene would be spectacular!

Suppressing his anger, Alexander forced a gentle smile, "Sure, I'll plead with Grandpa!"

Olivia beamed, gratefully chirping, "Thanks, brother!"

During her stay at Peterson Manor, she noticed how Alexander was doted on while Isabella seemed like an outsider. With Alexander's support, Grandpa wouldn't harm her, giving her time to figure out the medicine before leaving with Isabella!

Still as sweet and innocent as ever!

Alexander couldn't resist patting her head, warmly saying, "Olivia, as long as you're happy with Isabella, I'll do anything!"

Calling her brother felt like swallowing a thorn.
