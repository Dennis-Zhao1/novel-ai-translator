Title: Olivia and Ethan's Unexpected Journey

Olivia Stewart was chatting with her friend Ethan King over a casual lunch of burgers and fries when the topic of Ethan's mysterious wealth came up. Ethan was known for his successful tech ventures, with software sales reportedly in the millions. Olivia couldn't help but feel a bit proud of her friend's accomplishments, even if Ethan seemed a little uneasy about it.

"Did Isabella Peterson investigate me back then?" Ethan asked, his eyes darkening slightly. "I suppose you know about my real identity, so I won't bother explaining."

"Yeah, wait a minute!" Olivia suddenly exclaimed, standing up and pointing a fry at Ethan like it was a magic wand. "Are you married?"

Ethan couldn't help but chuckle at Olivia's antics. Her concern was endearing, and he found it amusing how she jumped to conclusions so quickly.

"Relax, Olivia, I'm still single," Ethan assured her with a playful wink.

Olivia let out a huge sigh of relief and plopped back into her chair. "You scared me! I was wondering how you'd handle a woman with the same interests as you."

Ethan shook his head, the little bit of warmth he felt quickly dissipating as Olivia teased him.

"So, your granddad tried to force you into marriage, right? Did you escape again, or did you finally come out to him?" Olivia asked, leaning forward eagerly.

Ethan playfully flicked her forehead. "Neither," he replied, grinning.

Olivia's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "Then what's the deal? Tell me!"

Ethan leaned back, crossing his fingers under his chin. "I convinced him to let me be. Simple as that."

"Just like that?" Olivia raised an eyebrow, skeptical.

"Just like that," Ethan confirmed with a smile.

"I don't buy it!" Olivia scrunched her nose, looking like a mischievous cat.

"You're too smart, Olivia," Ethan said, snapping his fingers. "I told my granddad I had someone I was interested in. He could either give me time to pursue them or force me to marry someone I'd never touch."

Olivia gave him a thumbs up. "Brilliant move!"

"My granddad reluctantly gave me a year. In that time, I can do whatever I want, but after a year, I have to bring him a daughter-in-law and a grandchild."

"Wow... Your granddad’s not easy to fool. Where are you going to find a wife and a kid in a year?" Olivia said, tilting her head.

Ethan gave her a teasing smile. "Well, there's always you."

"Me?" Olivia pointed to herself, considering the idea. "I could pretend to be your girlfriend, but where would we get a kid?"

Ethan chuckled, not daring to voice his cheeky thought. He knew Olivia might just storm off if he did.

"We could always borrow a kid. But is it really okay to trick your granddad like that?" Olivia asked, still pondering the plan.

Ethan flicked her forehead gently again. "That's a problem for future us. Who knows? Maybe by then, I’ll have met someone I really like."

"Oh, please!" Olivia scoffed. "I think you'll find a boyfriend before a girlfriend. You're more worried than me, and I'm the one who's supposed to be the 'emperor' here!"

Ethan surrendered, laughing. "Alright, alright, you're the emperor. I'll be your loyal subject."

Olivia giggled, her eyes twinkling. "You're quite the charmer, Ethan. What happened with your first love, Lisa?"

Ethan's expression darkened a bit, and he nodded.

"Do you still... love her?" Olivia asked cautiously.

Ethan rolled his eyes, pretending to adjust his hair. "I've changed my taste, remember? If I were to like a woman again, it would be someone like you, not her."

"Good to know!" Olivia replied quickly, then corrected herself. "I mean, she's not worth your time. I've heard some not-so-great rumors about her."

Ethan gave a bitter smile. "You don't have to sugarcoat it. We broke up because I saw her stepping into hotel rooms with different big shots for roles."

"Whoa! Isn't that a bit too... much?" Olivia trailed off, choosing her words carefully.

"I once waited outside her room the whole night. What kind of business takes all night?" Ethan said with a sarcastic laugh.

"Yikes! Stop, that's too much for me," Olivia said, waving her hands. "You dodged a bullet there."

Olivia brightened up, tugging at Ethan's cheek playfully. "Come on, cheer up! I got a little revenge for you today. Lisa tried to start something with me, so I gave her wheelchair a little nudge, and she spun right into a pile of dog poop."

Ethan pictured the scene and couldn't help but laugh. Her mischief reminded him of their carefree days.

After they caught their breath, Olivia asked, "Why didn't Lisa just stick with you? Your background could've helped her."

"Back then, she only knew me as a farmer's son. She didn't realize how big the farm was," Ethan explained. "That experience made me wary of women until I met you."

Olivia winked mischievously. "I'm honored to change your mind! So, should I call you Mr. Ethan King or Mr. Great Farmer?"

Ethan's face flushed slightly. "Olivia, I never meant to deceive you. I was hiding from an arranged marriage and trying to live quietly. I changed my name from Ethan King to Ethan Great, and just never got around to explaining."

Olivia nodded understandingly. "Everyone has their secrets. Like when I was saving money and you jokingly called me stingy. It was all for my little sister's education."
