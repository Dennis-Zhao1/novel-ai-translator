只能远远地望着她

The mix of Kirin Gold Pill with milk showed no reaction. The mix of Shengjin Pill with milk caused severe gastrointestinal discomfort. The mix of Yanzong Granules with milk showed no significant change in the tadpole state. However, the FIC white tablets, renowned for treating infertility, when soaked in milk, had the opposite effect. It drastically reduced the sperm count in a healthy man, creating a false impression of infertility. Short-term use allowed recovery after discontinuation, but long-term use led to irreversible damage...

The handwritten drug test sheet was crammed with such details. Eventually, Olivia Stewart found out that Alexander Peterson had given Isabella Peterson FIC, a well-known international brand. The Peterson family had no suspicion.

Initially, Alexander must have fabricated a false infertility diagnosis for Isabella with the help of their family doctor, using it as an excuse to give Isabella the medication, aiming to put an end to his lineage. Fortunately, Isabella stopped using it when he returned home, thwarting Alexander’s malicious plan. The most recent infertility diagnosis was clearly another false impression caused by the medication!

How laughable that he had been played by Alexander, believing it to be true, especially when Olivia was pregnant...

Isabella slammed a fist onto his forehead, regretting his past actions. "Young Master!" Lucas Wright called out worriedly, trying to stop him.

Isabella looked up, determination in his eyes. "Don't worry, I won't give up! I'm going to get my wife and child back!" With renewed resolve, Isabella carefully tucked the drug sheet away and headed out the door.

He drove to the apartment where Olivia and Ethan King once shared. Choosing a low-profile black sedan, Isabella had Amy Green help him disguise himself, dulling his striking features. Despite this, his tall frame and extraordinary aura still drew attention as he walked through the quiet neighborhood park.

Among the leisurely strollers was a young couple. The petite, delicate woman and the tall, handsome man with striking features were unmistakably Olivia and Ethan.

Isabella stood afar, watching Ethan gently support Olivia as they walked, as if she was a rare treasure. The sight pierced his heart deeply. Olivia, carrying his child, should have been by his side, protected by him.

His dark eyes were fixed on Olivia’s simple, delicate face. She seemed thinner, her small face pale, making her large eyes appear even brighter. He longed to rush over, to embrace her, to ask if she was okay...

But he didn’t dare. He feared his presence would shatter the serene warmth. Isabella clenched his fists, his lips pressed into a tight line, silently observing.

As Olivia and Ethan strolled through the garden, she remained unaware of the intense gaze following her every move. "Tired? Let’s rest for a bit," Ethan suggested, guiding her to a nearby white bench.

Olivia chuckled, "I've been feeling weak and listless lately, but it's normal in early pregnancy. You don’t have to worry so much; I'm not that delicate!"

Ethan sat beside her, his expression serious. "Olivia, you've seen the premiere and received the medication investigation results. How long do you plan to stay here? Are you waiting for Isabella to come find you after clearing the misunderstanding?"

She bit her lip, unable to respond. Ethan, frustrated, raised his voice, "Have you forgotten all the past hurt? You’ve proven your innocence this time, but what if he misunderstands you again? He’s such a petty man!"

Olivia remained silent, head bowed. Ethan sighed, softening his tone, "Olivia, come back to Australia with me. There, you’ll find the purest skies and the widest pastures. If you tire of one place, we can travel elsewhere. I’ll be with you wherever you choose to live, however long you want."

Finally, she looked up into Ethan’s earnest eyes, filled with guilt. "Crazy, I’m sorry, I don’t want to be a burden to you like this!"

“Hey, what are you saying?” Ethan’s eyes twinkled, masking his deep feelings with a teasing smile. “Remember when I had that terrible accident? If you hadn’t begged Isabella to save me, I wouldn’t be here. So, you’re my savior, and the only way I can repay you is by offering my life!”

“Pfft!” Olivia laughed, unable to hold it in.

From a distance, Isabella watched them, seeing a scene of playful banter. Yet, instead of jealousy, he felt a pang of envy and regret. It took all his willpower not to rush over and whisk Olivia away!

On the park bench, Olivia gently touched her still-flat belly, a soft, motherly glow on her face. Ethan, noticing, spoke quietly, “Olivia, if you’re worried about the baby, don’t be. I’ll love him as my own. Anything you bring into this world, I’ll love as much as I love you.”

Faced with such straightforward affection, she couldn’t evade any longer. She looked down, her voice honest, “Ethan, you must know, for now, and maybe for a long time, even a lifetime, there’s no room for anyone else in my heart.”

Ethan was taken aback, slightly indignant, “What’s so great about Isabella? Is he really that important to you?”

Olivia smiled ruefully, “Honestly, I don’t know what’s good about him. He’s petty and has a terrible temper! I know it’s pathetic, but I just can’t forget him! Plus, he’s the father of my child!”

“Even so, I have no intention of continuing with him. I’ll have the baby, raise it, and love it myself. I need to prove my innocence and won’t rest until I throw the paternity test results in that man’s face!”

Ethan watched her with a self-mocking smile, understanding that love and hate are intertwined.

“Olivia, I don’t expect you to love me, but I ask you to let me stay by your side. For someone who loves without being loved back, being able to give is a kind of happiness. Please, don’t cruelly take away my happiness.”

Ethan, having confessed his feelings, chose not to hide them anymore. Previously, his hesitation allowed Isabella to enter Olivia’s heart first.

Olivia looked into Ethan’s sincere eyes. Normally, she’d distance herself from any man showing interest, but with Ethan, she couldn’t say no. In the end, she softly said, “Okay.”

The bench was chilly, so they didn’t sit long. After chatting for a while, Ethan helped Olivia back to the apartment.

Isabella watched their retreating figures until they disappeared into the building before silently turning away.

Back at his place, Isabella dove into his study, the first thing he did was hack into Olivia’s computer and phone camera. But Olivia, concerned about radiation while pregnant, stayed far from such devices, leaving Isabella frustrated and anxious.

In the following days, Isabella, like an addict, drove to the neighborhood daily to watch over Olivia from afar.

Sometimes, Olivia would venture out with Ethan. Having gained fame, she rarely left home, always donning a scarf, mask, and oversized coat for protection.

Isabella could always recognize Olivia instantly, then follow from a distance. Just seeing her silhouette brought him immense joy.

One day, while sitting in his car on the street, gazing at Olivia across the road, he noticed a commotion nearby. A teenage boy, holding flowers, chased after his girlfriend, pleading for forgiveness. When she ignored him, he knelt on one knee...

Watching the scene, a thoughtful expression crossed Isabella’s deep, dark eyes.

A few days later, Olivia received a call from Billion Films, informing her that the original recording of "Secretly Falling in Love," the theme song for "Send an Angel to Love You," had been damaged, requiring her to re-record it at the studio. Suspecting nothing, she had Ethan drive her there.

As she got out of the car, she told Ethan, “Crazy, you can head back. Recording can take a long time, sometimes all day. No need to wait for me!”

Ethan nodded, “Alright, just call me when you’re done, and I’ll pick you up.”

Ethan drove a little way down the street before pulling over to wait. How could he leave? He’d wait a lifetime, let alone a day. He only pretended to leave to ease Olivia’s mind.

With sunglasses on, Olivia cheerfully entered the company building. Upon stepping into the lobby, she was stunned by a sea of red. The ceiling was adorned with floating balloons and streamers, the floor covered in vibrant red rose petals, filling the air with their sweet fragrance. In the center, a long red carpet lined with large red roses stretched all the way upstairs.

Was someone getting married?

The reception desk was gone, and the lobby was eerily silent. Unsure whether to proceed, Olivia noticed a red rose at her feet. Curious, she picked it up. Attached to the stem was a small card, on which was written...
