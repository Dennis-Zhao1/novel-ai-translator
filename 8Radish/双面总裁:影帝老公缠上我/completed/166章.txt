Olivia Stewart was fuming, stomping her foot in frustration. "Isabella Peterson, you jerk! You promised not to laugh at me!"

But then, her tone softened, laced with a mix of curiosity and shyness. "Isabella Peterson, when he kissed me, it felt almost like you. Do all you guys taste the same?"

Isabella couldn't help but chuckle at Olivia's adorable confusion, his heart melting like butter on a hot pancake. Through the window, he playfully caressed her cheek, his voice smooth and teasing. "Sweetheart, just get home. I've got all the answers for you."

Thanks to Isabella's guidance, Olivia had picked up a thing or two. She rolled her eyes and chided him, "Isabella Peterson, you're such a bad influence!"

Watching Olivia hang up the phone in a flustered huff, Isabella's lips twisted into a mischievous smile. His eyes twinkled with a blend of mischief and affection. Oh, he'd show her just how bad he could be.

Olivia soon hopped into her security car, while Isabella switched to his sports car, racing back home. Once inside their sprawling estate, Isabella wasted no time pulling Olivia into their room to engage in a lengthy debate about taste. Eventually, Olivia found herself begging for mercy, utterly exhausted. "Isabella Peterson, I give up! No more silly discussions like this, ever!"

Isabella arched an eyebrow with a wicked grin. "But I quite enjoy these talks with you. They're exhilarating!"

Hearing his teasing tone, Olivia was at her wit's end. "You promised not to be jealous! You insisted I take that role, and now you torment me every day! You're such a big meanie! I might as well believe pigs can fly over trusting a man's word!"

Lounging beside her like a satisfied lion, Isabella watched her scrunched-up face with amusement. "Am I jealous? Not at all! I'm all for your career! Look, I'm sacrificing my time and energy to help you get into character. Isn't that great?"

Olivia groaned, too tired to argue. "I don't even want to talk to you right now," she muttered as she lazily closed her eyes. "Are you saying you want me to do more scenes with Ethan?"

Isabella was taken aback, his eyebrows shooting up. "No way! Those romantic scenes are for me to guide you through."

Olivia let out a massive yawn, her eyes drooping. "Enough guidance, I'm sleepy."

"Hey, you little rascal!" Isabella gently turned her face toward him, but she was already fast asleep, her breathing steady and peaceful.

"So easily worn out. You're out of practice," Isabella whispered, pulling her closer to make her comfortable. "Sorry, sweetheart, for tiring you out again."

His gaze softened as he watched Olivia sleep, feeling a twinge of guilt mixed with affection. He brushed a stray lock of hair from her face, his eyes lingering on her with the warmth of a comforting cup of coffee.

A soft buzz from the phone on the nightstand broke the silence. Isabella frowned, glancing at Olivia to make sure she was still asleep before grabbing the phone.

Who'd be calling at this hour?

Isabella didn't realize it was still quite early. He glanced at the screen, his expression turning cold.

Darn it!

Suppressing his anger, he gently eased Olivia's head onto the pillow and slipped out to the study, phone in hand.

His footsteps echoed in the hallway, accompanied by his low growl. "What's going on?"

"Sir, we've found a lot of negative stuff online about Olivia Stewart. Rumors about her past and claims of using underhanded tactics to get her role..."

"That's absolute nonsense!" Isabella barked, shoving the study door open. He quickly pulled up the web pages, his frustration boiling over as he slammed the mouse down, sending everything on the desk crashing to the floor.

"Who the heck is behind this?"

"I'm sorry, sir. We haven't traced the source yet. They're using foreign servers and self-destructing messages. It's incredibly sophisticated."

"Idiots! Get more techs on it, and keep digging!"

Isabella pounded the desk, causing it to crack. "Yes, sir!" the subordinate replied, hanging up to get to work.

Staring at the flood of malicious posts, Isabella's eyes flared with anger. How dare they attack his woman!

Just when things were calming down, this new wave of rumors had incited Olivia's critics once again. Fans of Ethan could handle him liking someone, but not Olivia, who they saw as beneath him.

Ethan's fans were already on edge, and with some instigators in the mix, Olivia became the target of their rage. Calls to recast her role flooded in, threatening her career.

The studio's crisis team was on it, but the rapid spread made it a tough battle. Without a source, the negativity kept growing, and Olivia's reputation was at stake.

Who was behind this?

Isabella's mind raced through the possibilities. Could it be someone from the cast, like Sophie Cook or Lisa?

His deep-set eyes scanned the screen, methodically tracking the information trail. But every lead vanished, the sophisticated tactics thwarting his efforts.

Time ticked by, Isabella tirelessly working, oblivious to fatigue, a silhouette of determination etched against the window.

Lucas Wright quietly entered, placing a cup of coffee on the desk before slipping out. "Don't let Olivia know about this," Isabella instructed without looking up.

"Yes, sir," Lucas replied, understanding the gravity of the situation.

Isabella continued his relentless pursuit, driven by a resolve as strong as the coffee beside him.
