Back at the cozy confines of her studio, Olivia Stewart was in full creative mode. She dragged Isabella Peterson along with her, eager to craft a cute little clay figure of their soon-to-be newest family member, Tulip. With a giggle, she declared, “Now we’re a happy family of five!”

Isabella stood silently, feeling a bit out of sorts, but she knew better than to dampen Olivia's joy. As long as Olivia was happy, that was all that mattered. Olivia, pregnant and glowing, would often visit the orphanage, her face always lit up with a blissful smile.

Isabella would gently remind her, “Olivia, you can’t just focus on Tulip and forget about taking care of yourself.”

Olivia would always brush off the concern with a playful shake of Isabella's arm, “I know, I know. I just want the kids to bond early!”

Isabella, often left speechless, would accompany Olivia to the orphanage, spending most of her time sitting quietly in the car, lost in thought.

Over time, Olivia noticed Isabella’s somber mood. One day, after leaving the orphanage, she asked, “Do you not like Tulip?”

Isabella hesitated, the secret of Tulip’s parentage weighing heavily on her. The DNA test had been a mistake, a secret she wished she could forget. The more Olivia bonded with Tulip, the deeper the secret stayed buried.

Seeing Isabella’s conflicted expression, Olivia’s excitement dimmed. “Is it because Tulip is sick? Let me tell you, every child is an angel! I won’t allow you to think otherwise. Didn’t you have heart issues as a child? Do you want your son to feel abandoned like you did?”

Isabella sighed, rubbing her temples, “You’re overthinking it. I just have a severe resting face and don’t want to scare him. That’s why I let you spend more time with him.”

Olivia quickly retorted, “He’s afraid of you because you don’t spend enough time with him! From now on, when we visit, you’ll play with him, tell him stories, and join in his games!”

Isabella, feeling trapped but unable to argue, nodded with resignation, “Okay.”

Back home, Isabella couldn’t hold back her frustration any longer and vented to her brother, Alexander Peterson. Isabella had been quietly orchestrating a plan to reclaim her family’s business shares Alexander had wrongfully taken control of, watching as his financial empire slowly crumbled.

Meanwhile, Olivia, now five months pregnant with twins, was visibly larger and more radiant than ever. Her once petite frame had filled out, and she stood before the mirror in the bathroom, feeling a bit self-conscious.

Isabella found her standing there, lost in thought, and gently wrapped her arms around Olivia from behind, resting a hand on her growing belly. “What’s on your mind, my love?”

Olivia pouted, “I feel like I’ve gotten ugly!”

Isabella, usually so composed, burst out laughing. “You dare to laugh?” Olivia playfully swatted at Isabella. “Look at me, I’ve gotten wider everywhere… even here!”

Isabella’s teasing touch made Olivia blush. “You’re incorrigible!” she protested, swatting Isabella’s hand away. “I look like a ball!”

Isabella gently pinched her cheek, “I think you look great! There’s more of you to love now.”

“You’re incorrigible!” Olivia laughed, her earlier worries forgotten.

Today was their routine check-up day. Lucas Wright had arranged for the best specialists at the city’s top hospital to see them. Olivia insisted on going to the hospital like any other couple, enjoying the shared anticipation of their impending parenthood.

Accompanied by Isabella and a convoy of security vehicles, they made their way to the hospital. Olivia didn’t love the fanfare, but given recent events, she understood the necessity.

The check-up revealed that both babies were healthy. Olivia, holding the report, was thrilled. She wrapped her arms around Isabella’s neck, “Guess what, Isabella? Boys or girls?”

Isabella playfully tapped her nose, “Why not ask the doctor?”

Olivia pouted, “No way! I told them not to tell us. I want to savor the suspense!”

Isabella’s eyes twinkled with amusement, “If I guess right, you have to warm my bed every night and wear whatever I choose.”

Olivia blushed. This man was insatiable! “Fine! If you’re right, I’ll do as you say. But if not, you’ll have to do as I say!”

Isabella grinned as if he’d already won, “Deal!”

Olivia watched him expectantly. “What’s your guess?”

Isabella drew out the moment, “I guess… it’s either a boy or a girl!”

Olivia’s eyes widened in mock outrage. He’d tricked her! Of course, it was one or the other! She couldn’t help but laugh at his cleverness.

“You cheated!” she huffed.

“Not at all,” Isabella chuckled. “How about this: I hope it’s one of each, a boy and a girl.”

“Just like I imagined! So, if it is, who wins?” Olivia asked.

“We both win,” Isabella replied with a mischievous grin.

Olivia rolled her eyes, but inside, she felt a wave of happiness. Just then, a familiar voice interrupted their playful banter.

“Hey, sis, I just wanted to see you!” A pregnant woman called from a few steps away, blocked by their security.

Olivia turned to see the woman, her eyes widening in shock. “White Miao Miao?”

It was indeed her, though her usual trendy style had been replaced with something more rustic. And she was pregnant too!

“Can I just talk to you for a minute?” White Miao Miao pleaded.

“No, stay right there!” Olivia quickly responded. She wasn’t about to risk anything while pregnant.

“Say whatever you need to from there! And don’t call me ‘sis,’ it’s gross!”

Olivia glanced at Isabella, who looked completely bewildered. “I swear, I have nothing to do with her!” he insisted.

Olivia burst out laughing at his flustered response. It was a side of Isabella she rarely saw.

She decided to have a little fun. “You know what they say, right? Explaining is covering up. Look at you, guilty as charged!”

“I just didn’t want you to get the wrong idea,” Isabella defended himself.

Olivia gave White Miao Miao a skeptical look. “Look at those eyes! If you two aren’t involved, who’d believe it?”

Isabella, now aware of White Miao Miao’s adoring gaze, could only shake his head and sigh.
