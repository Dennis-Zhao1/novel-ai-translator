Grace Martin and her daughter, Emily, stood outside a modest-looking door. The butler gestured towards it, whispering, "This is the place, ma'am."

Emily glanced at the narrow staircase with disdain, her lips curling. "So much for being a big star. This place is a dump!"

The butler, trying to ease the tension, added, "Miss Olivia Stewart is staying at a friend's house at the moment. And, well, her friend is a man!"

Emily's eyes widened, and she exclaimed loudly, "Living with a man? Olivia Stewart is out of control! Typical of those in showbiz! And Dad rushed to bring her back into the family—won't that ruin our reputation?"

Grace Martin shot her daughter a stern look. "Your father has his reasons. When we get inside, hold your tongue. If you mess this up and we get kicked out, I won't help you."

Emily pouted, "Fine, I'll keep quiet."

The butler, satisfied they were ready, knocked on the door. After a few moments, it opened slightly, revealing a rather annoyingly handsome face. Ethan King, the man at the door, had a less-than-friendly tone. "Why all the knocking this early?"

"It's already late morning," the butler thought but didn't dare say. Instead, he put on a smile. "Mr. King, my lady and Miss Emily are here to see Miss Olivia Stewart."

Ethan gave a dismissive glance at the crowd in the hallway. "Olivia's sleeping. Wait outside and don't disturb her." With that, he closed the door.

Grace Martin fumed, her perfectly applied makeup unable to hide her irritation. She had expected a cold reception from Olivia but didn't anticipate being shut out entirely.

Emily stood there, stunned. "Was that Ethan King, the famous model?"

Grace Martin resisted the urge to kick her down the stairs. "Emily, focus! He's the man Olivia's living with. Get it together!"

Emily's face lit up with excitement, "She might have two good men in her life, but she can only choose one."

"Enough," Grace Martin snapped. "Let’s just wait."

After about ten minutes, Emily couldn't help herself. "Should we try knocking again?"

The butler hesitated, but Emily pushed him aside. "Let me do it."

She knocked, and when the door opened, she flashed a charming smile. "Mr. King..."

"It's the bathroom break," came the dry response from Olivia Stewart.

Emily's smile faltered. "Olivia! Why you?"

The butler quickly reminded her, "Miss Emily, we're here to see Olivia."

Turning to Olivia, he bowed slightly, "Miss Olivia, good day."

Olivia shrugged, glanced at them, and turned back inside without inviting them in.

Emily hesitated at the threshold but eventually entered, reluctantly saying, "Dad sent us with an evening gown for you."

Olivia plopped down on a chair, hugging a dolphin plushie, and pointed lazily at the couch. "Have a seat."

Grace Martin and Emily sat down, their faces tight with frustration. The butler and servants placed the exquisite gift boxes on the small coffee table, which quickly overflowed.

Emily's eyes roamed the room with a mix of disdain and curiosity. Olivia ignored her gaze, focusing on her plushie.

The butler introduced Grace Martin to Olivia, avoiding the term "mother." Olivia acknowledged it with a lazy nod, not even lifting her gaze.

Grace Martin forced a smile, though Olivia's indifference stung. Emily, still distracted by Ethan's absence, asked, "Is Mr. King really in the bathroom for that long?"

Olivia, amused, replied, "He's constipated."

The awkward silence returned.

Grace Martin nudged Emily to stop fantasizing. Emily reluctantly complied, though her eyes still flickered towards the bathroom.

Grace Martin, frustrated by her daughter's behavior, instructed, "Emily, show your sister the gifts."

Emily opened the largest box, revealing a stunning evening gown. "This is by the famous designer, Kemmy!"

She was so captivated she almost forgot her jealousy. "Want me to show you?"

"No need," Olivia said coolly, cutting off Emily's dreams.

Emily pouted and moved to the other boxes. "These are the accessories that go with the gown. Take a look!"

Each piece Emily unveiled was more dazzling than the last, and she couldn't help but admire them openly.

Olivia, however, was more entertained by Emily's reactions than the gifts themselves. When Emily finally sat back, exhausted, she remarked, "Look how generous Dad is to you!"

Olivia corrected her, "He's your dad, not mine."

"You ungrateful! Do you know this gown by Kemmy is hard to get? If you didn't acknowledge him, you wouldn't have such an opportunity."

Olivia, unfazed, replied, "Kemmy designs all my formal attire, thanks to Ethan. If these are so precious to you, take them back."

Emily, thrilled, reached for the gown, but Grace Martin stopped her. "Don't be hasty. Let's see if Olivia wants to give them to you first."

Emily sulked, withdrawing her hand.

Grace Martin, suppressing her growing anger, forced a smile, "Olivia, we were wrong before. We didn't know. These gifts are to formally welcome you back to the family. Please accept them."
