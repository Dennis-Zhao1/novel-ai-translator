"Love Me or Leave Me"

Tian Yi's face darkened a bit, his usually mesmerizing eyes flickering with an eerie blue light. Back then, Miguo had no recollection of who he was, and even strongly opposed staying at Shuiming Pavilion, let alone the fact that he had a fiancée?

He had planned to resolve all this mess before telling Olivia Stewart everything, but who would have thought that Bai Miaomiao would shamelessly follow him here.

Of course, he wanted to send Bai Miaomiao packing with a swift kick, but if he angered the old man, Olivia Stewart’s safety would be at risk!

These were things he dared not mention to Olivia Stewart!

Feeling frustrated, Tian Yi took a long swig from his drink. What was supposed to be a solo escape into drunkenness turned into a drinking session for two. Yet, no matter how much he drank, Tian Yi remained unfazed, his mind as sharp as ever, putting Olivia Stewart’s drinking tolerance to shame.

“Sigh, forget it, maybe we shouldn’t be in love, it might harm you, I shouldn’t have gotten involved with you,” Olivia Stewart muttered dreamily, her eyes slightly squinted in a tipsy haze.

Tian Yi paused with his drink just at his lips, “What did you say?”

Olivia Stewart rubbed her head in frustration, casting an apologetic glance at Tian Yi before quickly looking down.

“Actually, I wanted to be with you for selfish reasons.”

“Sometimes, you remind me so much of him.”

“I craved the feeling of being with you because of that.”

“I shouldn’t have gotten involved with you, Tian Yi, that was my mistake!”

Olivia Stewart rambled on, her words tumbling out in a rush.

Tian Yi’s lips curved slightly upward as he downed his drink in one go. This time, the bitterness transformed into sweet ambrosia.

Olivia Stewart tilted her head, looking at him, “Tian Yi, you’re not mad?”

That soft, endearing voice!

Tian Yi felt a tug at his heartstrings as if a little cat had just pawed at them. If it weren’t for the fear of revealing his identity, he’d have pulled this enchanting troublemaker into his arms right then and there!

Olivia Stewart leaned closer, “You’re really not mad?”

“…”

“Sigh, I guess I’m just not charming enough!”

Looking at Olivia Stewart’s distressed face, chin in hand, Tian Yi found himself both amused and exasperated. Did she really think he needed to do something to prove her charm?

What kind of logic was that?

“Oh, by the way, there used to be rumors about you and Yi Ge. Is that true?”

This little rascal!

Tian Yi clenched his fist so tight it could squeeze water out. He almost felt like giving her a spank right then!

Maybe it was the icy aura radiating from Tian Yi that made Olivia Stewart shiver. She scooted away slightly, waving her hand timidly, “I didn’t mean any offense! I just…”

“You know, right?” Olivia Stewart suddenly whispered in Tian Yi’s ear, “Yi Ge is actually Isabella Peterson. If he swings both ways, we’d be rivals in love!”

“So, this matter needs to be clarified!”

Her warm breath carried the sweet scent of youth, mingling with the rich aroma of alcohol, creating a heady mix that intoxicated Tian Yi.

But as he turned around and met Olivia Stewart’s earnest face, all his thoughts vanished!

Olivia Stewart was still staring at him, her expression one of pure curiosity.

Tian Yi gently tapped the back of her head, “Silly! He’s our leader! Did you forget?”

“Oh, so you’re cozying up to him! Tian Yi, who knew you were such a brown-noser!”

This little thing was truly drunk out of her mind!

Tian Yi stood up, pulling Olivia Stewart into his embrace with authority.

“Let’s go, I’ll take you home!”

…

The next day, as Olivia Stewart finished her work, she spotted a Group Peterson security car parked off in the distance. She tried to act like she didn’t see it and attempted to slip away in another direction.

But then, a flashy red Ferrari screeched to a halt in the middle of the road, blocking her path.

There was no avoiding it now.

Olivia Stewart stopped in the middle of the street.

The Ferrari’s window slowly rolled down, revealing a sharply defined profile with perfect angles. Of course, it was Isabella Peterson!

Olivia Stewart quickly averted her eyes. She didn’t trust herself to look any longer, for fear her gaze might cling to Isabella Peterson’s face and never let go!

“Get in the car!”

Isabella Peterson’s voice was deep, magnetic, and commanding, leaving no room for argument.

“I won’t!”

Olivia Stewart retorted instinctively.

Suddenly, a black gun barrel appeared, pressing directly against Olivia Stewart’s forehead.

Before Isabella Peterson could say a word, Olivia Stewart hastily agreed, “I’ll get in!”

She admitted it; she was afraid of dying!

Besides, a voice inside her had been screaming, “Get in! Just get in already!”

Once seated inside the car, reality hit Olivia Stewart. The man she loved most, Isabella Peterson, had pointed a gun at her!

The realization of immense hurt and disappointment spread like cracks on ice, rapidly expanding in all directions.

Isabella Peterson’s gun remained pointed at her temple, his voice as cold as water frozen over:

“Either love me, or die with me!”

“Countdown starts at three!”

“Three, two…”

“I love you!” Olivia Stewart shouted in a hurry.

Isabella Peterson cocked an eyebrow, his deep, dark eyes twinkling with a captivating light, like stars falling into the night.

A pleased smile tugged at his lips, forming a dangerously charming curve.

Olivia Stewart was infuriated by the amusement in his eyes, growling:

“I picked already, why are you still pointing that gun at me?”

This wild kitten was getting riled up!

Isabella Peterson’s smile deepened, and he withdrew the gun, elegantly twirling it with his fingers before it clattered into a corner.

“Ah!” Olivia Stewart gasped, “Why are you tossing it around like that? What if it accidentally went off?”

Isabella Peterson pulled her into his arms, his eyes burning with a fierce, molten intensity.

His voice was hoarse, almost unrecognizable:

“The only one who can make me lose control is you!”

“Isabella Peterson! Mm…”

Whatever words she had left were swallowed by Isabella Peterson in a long, fervent kiss.

By the time it ended, Olivia Stewart’s face was as red as if she’d downed a whole barrel of hundred-year-old wine.

Her soft body was draped over Isabella Peterson’s strong, muscular chest, like a docile, obedient kitten.

With his last bit of rationality, Isabella Peterson started the car, heading towards the nearest secluded woodland.

Olivia Stewart squirmed a bit against Isabella Peterson’s embrace, trying to get up, only to step on something hard.

Glancing down, she saw it was the gun!

Olivia Stewart pulled back her foot in surprise.

“Isabella Peterson, I stepped on the gun. What should I do?”

“It’s not a landmine, what are you scared of? Pick it up!”

Pick… pick it up?

Olivia Stewart shivered a bit.

For someone who’s always been a well-behaved kid, guns were such terrifying and mysterious objects!

But Isabella Peterson’s barely-there smirk…

Hmph!

She couldn’t let him look down on her!

Steeling herself, Olivia Stewart slowly reached down.

The cold metal felt like it would burn her hand, making her want to drop it immediately.

Olivia Stewart mentally cheered herself on.

Don’t drop it!

Don’t let Isabella Peterson laugh at you!

Holding her breath, Olivia Stewart’s slender, pale fingers clutched the gun tightly, lifting it swiftly.

But the more nervous she got, the more mistakes she made!

Her grip was so tight that she accidentally pulled the trigger!

“Bang—”

“Isabella Peterson! Move!”

Almost simultaneously, Olivia Stewart dropped the gun, lunging towards Isabella Peterson.

The force of her leap sent Isabella Peterson sprawling to one side, frantically turning the steering wheel.

The Ferrari jolted violently, coming to a stop by the roadside.

“Olivia Stewart, do you know how dangerous that was?”

Isabella Peterson’s voice was sharp with anger.

“I’m sorry, I was wrong!”

Olivia Stewart was a bit dazed.

But facing Isabella Peterson’s fury, apologizing seemed like the best option.

“Why’d you jump at me? Do you realize we almost ended up crashing?”

Wait, that’s what he was upset about?

Olivia Stewart opened her mouth, feeling a surge of frustration, her voice rising several octaves:

“How was I supposed to think about that? By the time I realized, you’d have been shot through!”

Hang on, wasn’t there supposed to be a bang?

Could it be a silenced gun?

Olivia Stewart scanned the car, finding no sign of bullet holes anywhere.

She suspiciously picked up the gun, opened the car window, aimed at a tree trunk outside, and pulled the trigger.

“Bang—”

A little blue flame flickered from the muzzle.

And just like that, it went out.

It was a lighter!

The whole time, the gun Isabella Peterson had pointed at her was just a lighter!

This cold, arrogant guy actually played such a childish trick!

“Isabella Peterson!”

Olivia Stewart growled, practically ready to tear him apart!

“Isabella Peterson, how old are you? Playing this soap opera nonsense, how childish can you get?”

A flicker of embarrassment crossed Isabella Peterson’s handsome face.

He had gotten the idea from a drama he watched last night.

But of course, he’d never admit that.

“Olivia Stewart, the issue at hand is you!”

“Remember, no matter the danger, protect yourself first!”

“I don’t need you to save me! So embarrassing!”

“Besides, with my skills, what danger can’t I avoid?”

Oh, so she was being overdramatic?

“Was I being overly sentimental?”

Olivia Stewart huffed, reaching to open the car door.

Isabella Peterson was quicker, locking it with a beep.

“Isabella Peterson, you…”

A sudden force, swift and strong, pulled Olivia Stewart’s head against a solid, broad chest.

Isabella Peterson’s muffled voice rumbled above her:

“Olivia Stewart, remember what I said!”

“I fear losing you more than losing everything else!”

Listening to his strong, steady heartbeat, Olivia Stewart’s heart trembled.

The mighty Isabella Peterson, who could command storms, admitting fear?
