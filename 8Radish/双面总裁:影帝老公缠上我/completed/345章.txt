"The Heart of a Parent"

"Let them in," Olivia Stewart said, settling onto the couch with a thoughtful expression crossing her pretty face.

Were those two still not giving up? Chasing her around just for a kidney?

Before long, the housekeeper led in John White and Grace Martin.

The moment Olivia saw them, she was taken aback. Had it really been three years since she'd last seen these two?

Time certainly aged people, but three years shouldn't have turned them this gray and weary! It was like they'd lived through an entire lifetime.

John's face was lined with deep wrinkles, his skin a rough, earthy hue that reminded Olivia of the farmhands back at the ranch. Grace, once so fond of dressing up, now bore a face marked by age, despite her attempts to dress up. She couldn't hide the smoky scent clinging to her, like someone who spent years tending the stove.

The two of them seemed entirely changed, as if they'd swapped lives with someone else. Olivia stared at them, an indescribable feeling welling up inside her.

She didn't ask, but she could guess what had brought them here.

Seeing Olivia's gaze settle on her, Grace lowered her head, while John looked embarrassed, his face a map of wrinkles.

Despite having tried to clean themselves up, years of wind and sun on the ranch had stripped their once pampered appearances.

The room was eerily quiet.

Under Olivia's scrutinizing gaze, John and Grace shrank back, trying to minimize their presence. Though silent, their faces screamed of insecurity.

Olivia sighed, breaking the silence first. "What brings you here today?"

Grace snapped back to reality and replied quickly, "Oh, we just wanted to see you!"

With that, she motioned for John to present something. Olivia followed Grace's gaze and noticed a cooler by John's feet.

John bent down to open it, carefully taking out a thermos. Grace wrapped it in a white towel and placed it on the coffee table in front of Olivia, glancing at her timidly. "I thought you might not be used to being back, so I made you some soup."

Olivia's eyes traveled to Grace's now rough hands. "Was it you who made the soup at the ranch?"

"Yes! I was good at it. I didn't want to upset you by showing up, so I stayed hidden," Grace admitted, looking like a child caught doing something wrong.

Olivia turned to John, "And you? What did you do at the ranch?"

"Grass cutter, milker, feeder... anything that needed doing."

As he spoke, John's face flushed with embarrassment. After all, a man's pride, especially in front of his daughter, was no small thing. Would she despise him for such humble work?

In truth, John needn't have worried. Olivia, having come from humble beginnings, never looked down on the hard-working. Her opinions of John and Grace weren't tied to their jobs.

Seeing them so aged and cautious, Olivia didn't feel joy; rather, she felt a heaviness, like a weight pressing on her chest.

"Why are you doing this?" Olivia asked.

Grace and John exchanged a guilty look. "To atone."

"Atone?" Olivia frowned. "You followed me to the ranch, one as a worker, the other a maid, just to atone?"

"Yes," Grace nodded. "Of course, it would be wonderful if you could forgive us. But even if you can't, at least we can see you happy and do something for you to lessen our past sins."

Olivia looked at them, seeing no trace of deceit or falsehood, but rather warmth and hope.

People say that knowing one's mistake and correcting it is the greatest virtue, but that's easy to say when the hurt wasn't inflicted on you.

No matter how much time passes, it can dull but not erase the pain.

A truly hurt person can't simply forget or forgive, especially when it's their own parents.

The more you care, the more you hold onto what they've done...

Grace hesitated before speaking again, "Olivia..."

Olivia looked up, surprised by the use of her name. When had Grace started calling her that?

"Olivia," Grace fidgeted with her clothes, struggling to speak, "We know our presence like this might embarrass you. But rest assured, we won't tell anyone you're our daughter. If you don't want to acknowledge us, we won't pressure you, and we'll never bring it up again."

"We came today because we have two requests."

Grace paused, exchanging a glance with John, then continued, "After the White family fell apart, we had nothing left for you. Later, I inherited some money from a distant relative. We wanted to use it for your treatment, but when we sent it to the ranch, Mr. Peterson didn't accept it. Now that you're well, we want to give it to you."

Afraid Olivia might refuse, Grace added quickly, "Though this money can't compare to what the Petersons have, it's always good for a girl to have something of her own, just in case..."

Grace's words carried a hint of personal experience.

John interrupted her urgently, "What are you saying in front of the kid?"

Grace realized her blunder and glanced worriedly at Olivia, slapping her hand against her mouth. "I'm sorry, I was talking nonsense. Our Olivia is so wonderful, how could she ever be out of favor? Olivia, please don't mind!"

Earlier she called her Olivia, now in her anxiety, she reverted to calling her Olivia again.

Watching them in their panic, Olivia couldn't quite articulate her feelings. She stifled the strange, stuffy sensation in her heart and asked, "And the second thing?"

"The second thing is..." Grace hesitated, a look of embarrassment crossing her face, "I wanted to ask if I could work here as a maid. Don't worry, I can handle all the kitchen chores and would never reveal our relationship. I just want you to have fresh soup whenever you want it."

Olivia couldn't help but chuckle.

What kind of daughter would let her own mother work as a kitchen maid?

Forget what others might say, she couldn't even reconcile it with herself.

Even if she didn't want to acknowledge this mother.

Besides, after three years of soup, did Grace really think she wouldn't be tired of it?

Then again, maybe she'd grown accustomed, even reliant on it.

Clearly, Olivia fell into the latter category.

The first meal back at her place, she realized the chef's soup just didn't measure up to what she'd had on the ranch.

A parent's heart is always selfless!

Without their past hurts, she might be moved to tears by now.

But trying to mend everything with a pot of soup after all the hurt and manipulation? It's almost laughable.

Olivia rubbed her forehead.

Despite how laughable John and Grace's actions seemed now, she couldn't bring herself to laugh.

They'd done terrible things to her, but putting aside that they were her biological parents, in retrospect, Grace's actions were always about standing up for Mia White.

From another angle, as a mother, she was just protecting her child—what was wrong with that?

Even compared to her own mother, Sophia Allen, who spent a lifetime scheming to make her a tool for revenge and manipulation, Grace seemed better.

Yet Grace could never have imagined that in her efforts to secure happiness for her child, she ended up inflicting all the harm on her real daughter!

In the grand scheme of things, John was the instigator, and Sophia, the mastermind with the darkest intentions.

After three years, Olivia's intense resentment had faded, but forgiveness was still far off.

After pondering for a while, Olivia spoke:

"The first thing, I won't take your money. I'm not planning to take care of you, so you should keep it for your own retirement."

"The second thing, whether you say it or not, and whether I acknowledge it or not, the fact remains you're my biological mother. I can't accept my mother working in the kitchen as a maid. I've had that soup for three years, and I'd like to try something new. Mrs. White, why not go home and enjoy life with Mr. White? Make some soup from time to time for the two of you to enjoy."

Grace's eyes dimmed with disappointment.

John's expression mirrored hers, filled with defeat.

Two elderly souls, utterly deflated.

They thought Olivia despised them, but in truth, she just needed time to process things and wasn't ready for much interaction with them.

After an awkward silence, John spoke, "Olivia, forgive our intrusion. It's okay if you don't accept the money. As your only direct relative, you're the primary heir. I just hope that when the lawyer contacts you, you'll sign the inheritance papers."

John's message was clear: if you don't take it now as a dowry, then let it come to you as an inheritance after we're gone—please, just accept it.

It was a heavy statement.
