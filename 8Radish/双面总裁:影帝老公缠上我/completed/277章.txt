Olivia Stewart stood there, completely stunned, her eyes locked onto Isabella Peterson like she had fallen into the depths of those captivating eyes.

She had attended numerous parties with Isabella Peterson, where he usually made an appearance as the laid-back, charming version of himself. But today, he was exuding an aura of undeniable authority and charisma.

Olivia felt her heart flutter uncontrollably as she fought the urge to shout, "Oh my gosh, he's so handsome it's unreal!" His sharp features, tightly pressed lips, and the distinct air of coolness he carried were a stark contrast to Alexander Peterson's demeanor. He was like a magnet, pulling everyone toward him with an irresistible force.

And the way those women were looking at him! Olivia felt a strange pang of jealousy and couldn't help but glare at Isabella Peterson.

Alexander, meanwhile, maintained his cool, aloof expression, though a tiny, almost invisible smirk played on his lips.

"Ah, Isabella, you've arrived!" said White, the host, stepping in to break the tension between the two.

"Yeah," Isabella responded casually, his gaze slicing through the air like a blade, making White feel uneasy.

White chuckled nervously, unsure of what he'd done to offend Isabella. "Thank you for coming to my daughter's welcome party, Isabella!"

Isabella's expression shifted slightly, a flicker of annoyance crossing her face. "I don't like being called 'second young master.'"

The room fell silent, eyes darting between Isabella and Alexander. By rejecting the title, Isabella was indirectly denying Alexander's claim as the first son, which made Alexander's expression darken momentarily. But he quickly masked it behind his glasses.

Isabella then approached Olivia, gently tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear with a touch that was both natural and tender. "Not bad," he murmured, his words ambiguous enough to leave Olivia guessing whether he meant her hairstyle or her.

The brief contact sent a jolt through Olivia, and she blushed furiously. She knew she was doomed; no matter how much Isabella ignored or mistreated her, she couldn't help but be drawn to him. One word from him, and she'd forgive anything.

Embarrassed by Isabella's public display and frustrated with herself, Olivia turned away, her voice cold, "Isabella, please behave."

Isabella couldn't help but smile at her seriousness. She was still upset, and he owed her an explanation, after all.

"Olivia, I'm back," Isabella said softly, his voice a deep, magnetic rumble. "Back to marry you, properly this time."

"Hmph!" Olivia huffed, turning away, mumbling, "What's it to me?"

Alexander, already irritated by Isabella's presence, quickly stepped between them, playing the protective role. "Isabella, you're used to doing as you please, but remember, she's White's daughter. Show some respect. Besides..."

Alexander glanced triumphantly at Isabella. "I've already proposed to White. Olivia will be your sister-in-law soon, so watch your behavior!"

Proposed? Sister-in-law!

Isabella's brows knitted tightly, his fists clenching in frustration. So that's why Alexander had come all this wayâ€”to get ahead of him!

Seeing Isabella's reaction, Alexander felt a smug satisfaction.

Isabella remained silent for a moment, then his expression shifted to one of playful charm. He turned to White, voice dripping with confidence, "Funny, because I have an existing engagement with your daughter. I had unilaterally called it off, much to my family's displeasure. To make amends, I'm reinstating it, but this time, with Olivia Stewart!"

Isabella's piercing gaze landed on Olivia, making her heart race once again. She turned away, trying to hide her flustered state.

White was caught in a dilemma, glancing between Isabella and Alexander, feeling like he was stuck in a pressure cooker. Ideally, Isabella would acknowledge the engagement, but with Alexander now holding significant shares, his preference leaned toward Alexander. However, Isabella was formidable, and the future of the Peterson Group was uncertain. Choosing the wrong side could be disastrous.

In those brief moments, White calculated his options and decided to remain neutral, letting Olivia choose the victor. "Ha, my daughter is truly blessed to have both Peterson brothers vying for her hand!"

White laughed awkwardly, putting on a troubled expression. "But Olivia needs time to decide who she wants to marry. Let's give her space to make her own choice."

"You're sure you'll let her decide?" Isabella asked, a cold edge to his voice.

"Of course!" White replied, though he planned to guide Olivia in navigating between the brothers without offending either.

"Great!" Isabella said, taking a glass of wine, his eyes fixed on Olivia as he downed it.

Alexander knew White was a pragmatist and wouldn't let Olivia marry a penniless Isabella, so he confidently drank his own glass, smiling. "I have no objections!"

The room buzzed with envy and curiosity. The Peterson brothers, heirs to the most powerful conglomerate, were both intent on marrying Olivia Stewart. White and Olivia were the center of attention, receiving looks of admiration and jealousy.

Olivia stood quietly, like a spectator at her own show, her expression cool, with a hint of sarcasm. "So, you've decided?"

Her voice was soft yet clear, carrying a natural allure that was both disarming and chilling.

White suddenly remembered his daughter's feelings and, smiling paternally, suggested, "Don't rush, Olivia. If you're unsure, you can consider my advice."

"No need!" Olivia waved him off, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She turned to the brothers with a teasing smile, "How about this? You two fight it out, and whoever wins, I'll choose!"

Isabella's lips curved into a resigned smile. This girl was playing games.

He wasn't afraid of a fight; he could take Alexander down easily. But in front of everyone at a formal party? Olivia wasn't interested in the outcome; she wanted them embarrassed.

After all, they hadn't even asked her opinion in their marriage plans.

Fine, if she wanted to play, he'd play along.

Isabella slowly rolled up his sleeves, looking at Olivia with a hint of affection, "If you want to see me fight, I'll give you a show. But when I win and carry you off, don't regret it!"

His words were laced with mischief, but his charm made it hard to be annoyed, instead leaving a fluttering excitement.

While Isabella was ready to indulge Olivia's challenge, Alexander wasn't falling for it. He adjusted his glasses, maintaining his composed demeanor. "This isn't my kind of game."

"Oh?" Curious eyes turned to him.

"It's not that I can't win. I just don't make it a habit to fight my brother."

With that, Alexander subtly undermined Isabella, leaving the room buzzing with intrigue and Olivia in the spotlight of a very public sibling rivalry.
