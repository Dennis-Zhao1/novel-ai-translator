"You have no right to mention her name," Isabella Peterson declared coldly, her eyes narrowing as she stared down James Cook.

James Cook, with his shifty eyes darting around like a cornered rat, chuckled nervously. "Hey, Isabella, since Olivia Stewart is on good terms with you, how about sharing a couple of those fine wines with me?" He pointed to a rack of bottles, obviously drooling over the thought.

The bodyguards nearby were fuming. This old man had been making a fuss about meeting their boss, only to reveal it was all for a drink? They were itching to kick him out, but with Isabella still in the room, they held their tempers, anxiously glancing at her, hoping not to get caught in the crossfire.

Isabella barely lifted an eyebrow, her voice icy as she spoke, "You have no right to mention her name."

"Why not? She's my daughter!" James Cook started to protest but faltered under Isabella's piercing gaze, mumbling, "I raised her."

"As far as I know, Olivia was self-reliant, working jobs to pay her own way through school. You never gave her a dime. And for her mother's medical bills, you tried to sell her off, only to gamble away the money," Isabella recounted, her tone detached.

James Cook broke into a cold sweat, dropping to his knees before Isabella could finish. "Please, Isabella, spare me for sending Olivia to you," he begged.

Isabella remained silent, her fingers rhythmically tapping the armrest of her chair, the sound echoing like a judge's gavel in James Cook's mind.

"Olivia was pregnant once, wasn't she?" Isabella suddenly asked.

"Isabella..." James Cook crumbled, his face turning ashen. "Yes, she was, but I swear, the child was yours! She was innocent when she came to you, I promise!"

Fearing Isabella might doubt Olivia's past, James Cook hurriedly reassured her of Olivia's purity. He knew Isabella was aware of Olivia's relationship with Christopher Davis back then and dreaded her reaction.

"Olivia was pregnant with your child, but your family wouldn't accept it. She fell into depression and was publicly humiliated when she returned to town. I took her to the countryside," James Cook recounted in a voice barely above a whisper. "The child... didn't make it."

"Didn't you sell the child?" Isabella's voice was like a whip, as she slammed her hand down, breaking the armrest clean off.

James Cook stared at the fallen wood, wide-eyed as if seeing his own downfall. "Isabella! Mercy, please!" he pleaded desperately.

"I want the truth! You're not even Olivia's real father, so I owe you nothing!" Isabella demanded.

"I'll tell you everything! I promise it's the truth!" James Cook lifted his head, blood trickling from his forehead, a stark reminder of his desperation.

"I thought the child was unwanted, so I... sold him after Olivia gave birth. That's when her depression worsened," James Cook confessed, slumping to the floor, awaiting Isabella's judgment.

"Where was the child sold?" Isabella inquired.

"I can't remember. He was taken by some trafficker," James Cook admitted, sensing a glimmer of hope as Isabella seemed less concerned about the past. "If you spare me, I'll find the child for you!"

"You'd run the moment you were free," Isabella scoffed, seeing through his ploy.

James Cook's face drained of color as he realized he had no more cards to play.

"I'll ask you one last question. Answer truthfully, and I'll spare your life," Isabella said, her voice as cold as ice.

"Anything, anything!" James Cook seized the chance, clutching to it like a lifeline.

"Was the child a boy with a heart condition?" Isabella's gaze was intense, watching every nuance of James Cook's expression.

James Cook thought hard before nodding. "I didn't know about the heart condition, but it was a boy. I got a good price for him, so I remember clearly."

Everything matched what Isabella already knew. He'd thoroughly investigated, wary of any tricks Alexander might play. The child sold back then was indeed Olivia's son, abandoned at an orphanage after his heart condition was discovered.

Once he confirmed his suspicions, Isabella stood and left. He needed to return to Olivia, to make amends for the past. He'd missed out on protecting their first child, but he wouldn't make the same mistake with their twins. He was grateful Olivia hadn't given up on him.

"You told me everything. Can you let me go now?" James Cook called out to Isabella's retreating back.

"Olivia asked that you be spared as repayment for raising her," Isabella replied without looking back.

"How about a bottle of wine?" James Cook asked hopefully, but Isabella was already gone.

"Forget it! You think you can drink our young master's wine? Dream on!" a bodyguard said as they dragged James Cook away.

"Hey, where are you taking me? My daughter is your master's wife! She won't let you get away with this!" James Cook protested.

A bodyguard slapped a piece of tape over his mouth. "If I had a father like you, I'd have fed you to the sharks! You're lucky Olivia's kind enough to spare you. Now, off to your retirement home. Cooperate, and it'll be easier on you."

James Cook, defeated, could only hang his head. His own misdeeds had finally caught up with him.

Meanwhile, Isabella took a moment outside, changing clothes to shed the damp chill before returning to Olivia's side. He wanted to bring the scent of fresh flowers to her, a small gesture of comfort.

He entered the room quietly, finding a servant standing nervously inside.

"Why are you here?" Isabella asked, eyebrows raised in displeasure.

"I...Olivia told me to stay here while she went to the study," the servant stammered, pointing to the study door.

Isabella marched to the study, finding Olivia sitting in his chair, tears streaming down her face as she looked at her phone.

"Olivia," Isabella's heart ached as he rushed to her, cradling her head against his chest. "Don't cry, Olivia. It's okay."

"Isabella..." Olivia sobbed into his shoulder.

Isabella had never seen her so vulnerable, and it twisted his heart. What had hurt her so deeply?

He glanced at her phone and understood. She'd hacked into his device and uncovered everything he'd tried to hide.

With a resigned sigh, Isabella held her close, gently patting her back. "Don't cry anymore, sweetheart. You have two little ones to think about now. We can't upset them."

He'd do anything to make things right, to hold Olivia dear and protect their future together.
