Lucas Wright, the ever-dedicated butler, watched the closed door of Isabella Peterson's study with a mix of concern and hesitation. Isabella hadn't stepped out for an entire day and night, and it was well into the next day when Lucas stood there, debating whether or not to knock. Isabella was known for being a bit of a clean freak, so this was very out of character.

Lucas paced back and forth, caught between respecting Isabella's privacy and worrying about the lack of food and rest. He finally mustered the courage and knocked gently. From inside, a curt and cold voice replied, "Get lost!"

Realizing Isabella was still awake and likely not in a good mood, Lucas couldn't hold back anymore. He charged at the door with all his might, only to be bounced back by its unwavering sturdiness. Luckily, the carpet cushioned his fall.

As Lucas picked himself up, he remembered he had the keys to every room in the castle. Feeling a bit foolish, he fumbled for the study key. But just as he was about to unlock the door, it swung open to reveal Isabella's sleepless, dark-circled eyes glaring at him. "Old man, are you planning a rebellion?"

"Uh... Master, I apologize. Are you okay?" Lucas stammered, genuinely worried about Isabella’s red, bloodshot eyes.

Isabella, avoiding eye contact, snapped back, "Lucas, you're getting senile. Trying to break down my door? Your head must be full of rocks!"

"Yes, yes, Master is right!" Lucas smiled, relieved. Isabella's sarcastic retorts meant things were returning to normal.

As Isabella made to close the door, Lucas quickly interjected, "Master, perhaps you should eat something?"

"I'm not hungry!"

"Master, women can be complicated. Facing setbacks when pursuing someone is normal..."

"Shut up! You know nothing!" Isabella's face darkened, prompting Lucas to change tactics, "Alright, alright. It's just a woman, after all. Surely you wouldn’t starve yourself over something so trivial?”

Isabella's stare was icy, "Did you learn how to insult your master at Group Peterson?"

Lucas, though scolded, knew the lecture was necessary. Isabella couldn't continue this self-destructive path. He caught a glimpse of Isabella's study, where a large screen replayed a video of Olivia Stewart running through a garden. Isabella claimed to be working on a new software, but Lucas suspected otherwise.

Pretending not to notice, Lucas earnestly advised, "Master, your health matters. Balancing work and rest is important."

"Nagging old man," Isabella muttered, striding out of the study. Lucas wiped his brow and followed, relieved yet aware Isabella was now more demanding than ever.

Complaints about the castle's cleanliness and comfort became the norm, and everyone was on edge. Conversations about Olivia Stewart, formerly known as "White Miao Miao," were strictly off-limits, yet two maids whispered about her fate and were promptly caught by Isabella.

Standing on the castle steps, Isabella’s anger was barely contained as she glared at the gossiping maids. Just then, Lucas dashed over, "Master, there’s trouble! The bridge on the west outskirts seems to have issues. You should go take a look!"

Isabella frowned, "That bridge has been in use for years. Why problems now?"

"Problems arise with wear and tear! Please, Master, check it out."

Isabella, eyeing Lucas skeptically, finally agreed, "Prepare the car."

They sped to the west bridge, which bustled with traffic in the evening rush. Lucas pointed, "There, the first pillar."

Isabella looked and froze. Her eyes widened with an emotion Lucas couldn’t quite decipher, staring at something—or someone—by the bridge's underpass amid the bustling commuters...
