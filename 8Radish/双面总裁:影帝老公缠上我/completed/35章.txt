The lounge was buzzing with an air of sophistication, and there stood a tall man wearing oversized sunglasses that obscured much of his face, leaving only the sharp angle of his jaw and his thin lips visible. His profile was strikingly handsome, reminiscent of someone Olivia Stewart couldn't quite place but seemed so familiar—like Isabella Peterson.

Even from the back, there was a resemblance! But unlike Isabella, who preferred lounging in comfy clothes, this guy was decked out in a fitted black T-shirt and snug athletic pants, clearly showing off his well-toned physique. It was obvious he spent a lot of time at the gym.

Olivia mentally chastised herself for constantly seeing Isabella everywhere. Was she obsessing over him to the point of madness? Shaking off the thought, she diverted her gaze.

Next to Mr. Sunglasses stood a man dressed in a flamboyantly colorful outfit, holding a briefcase and giving off serious assistant vibes. Beside him was Emily, the club's manager, known for her commanding presence. Any big client that walked through those doors inevitably fell under her charm.

Olivia guessed Emily was prepping to work her magic on Mr. Sunglasses today. With that in mind, she grabbed a tray of drinks and headed over.

"Olivia, why are you still wearing that—" The manager's reprimand was cut short by a sharp glance from Emily, who sent the manager retreating with a disgruntled look. Despite her position, the manager was often sidelined whenever VIPs were around, with Emily specifically requesting Olivia to serve drinks.

Olivia sighed inwardly. It wasn't like she could help being younger, or having a more appealing face and figure.

Mr. Sunglasses turned his attention to Olivia, causing a shiver down her spine. Even through those thick lenses, she could feel the intensity of his gaze, sharp and penetrating.

Why was he looking at her like that?

Olivia lowered her head slightly, trying to collect herself. Emily, noticing Olivia's less-than-ideal attire, frowned momentarily before flashing a radiant smile. She smoothly addressed Mr. Sunglasses, inviting him to sit with a melodic voice that seemed to soften even the toughest clients.

Yet, Mr. Sunglasses was unfazed, not even acknowledging her invitation. The flamboyant assistant grinned mischievously and pulled out a chair for him, "Boss, have a seat!"

Finally, Mr. Sunglasses sat down, exuding an air of casual confidence.

Olivia couldn't help but side-eye the assistant, thinking, "This guy is just as crazy as his boss!"

Momentarily distracted, Olivia forgot about the drinks. Even as the guests were seated, she stood there, spacing out.

"Olivia!" Emily's stern whisper snapped her back to reality.

Mr. Sunglasses glanced at her, seemingly dissatisfied.

"Oh," Olivia quickly moved forward with the tray, bending slightly with a professional smile, "Sir, may I offer you something to drink?"

Mr. Sunglasses acted as if he hadn't heard, leaving Olivia awkwardly bent over.

Thankfully, she wasn't wearing anything too revealing today. Otherwise, she'd have felt even more exposed!

But holding the tray like this was uncomfortable. This guy was really testing her patience!

Olivia persisted, raising her voice slightly, "Sir, what would you like to drink?"

Mr. Sunglasses finally responded, his gaze lingering on her for a moment, his lips curling into a faint, mischievous smile as he quietly said, "Milk."

"Huh?" Olivia was momentarily confused. Typically, the lounge offered a variety of teas and coffee, maybe some juice for female clients. But milk? That wasn't on the menu!

"Sorry, we only have tea and coffee," Olivia replied softly.

Mr. Sunglasses remained silent, but the assistant chuckled, "Then let's get the boss a coffee."

Olivia placed a small coffee cup on the sleek glass table, "Please enjoy!"

Mr. Sunglasses gave her another look. Though she couldn't see his expression behind the sunglasses, Olivia felt like he was teasing her, deliberately being difficult!

Already in a bad mood, Olivia had no desire to linger around such a frustrating customer. After serving, she quietly retreated.

"Hey, pretty lady!" The assistant called out, grinning, "Don't forget our boss's request!"

Olivia paused again. Did this mean she had to go outside to buy some milk? But what kind? Yogurt, flavored milk, plain milk? What exactly did he want?

Not eager to run errands in the heat, Olivia considered asking for clarification, but Emily waved her off, "You can go now!"

This girl, so oblivious to the obvious hints, was hopeless!

As Emily turned back, she gave Mr. Sunglasses a sultry smile, sliding a brochure from under the table towards him, her voice as sweet as honey, "Are you interested in personal training or perhaps a group fitness package for your company? Let me give you a tour of what we offer."

Mr. Sunglasses didn't respond, so Emily continued, detailing the various fitness equipment and what muscles they targeted. She leaned in closer, ensuring her curves were perfectly showcased.

Unfortunately, Mr. Sunglasses kept his eyes on the brochure, seemingly more interested in the equipment than anything else. But his assistant was openly gawking, practically drooling.

Emily felt a bit dejected. Never before had a client been so indifferent after she had tried so hard to impress them.

Determined not to give up, Emily continued her pitch, inching closer to Mr. Sunglasses. Just as her upper body was about to graze his arm, he casually lifted his coffee cup and spilled it on her.

Emily's smile faltered for a second.

The assistant jumped in, "Oops, sorry about that, our boss's hand slipped!"

Emily quickly regained her composure, her smile back in place, "Well, in that case, would you mind helping me clean up?"

Mr. Sunglasses placed the cup back on the table with a clatter.

The assistant, still grinning, offered, "How about I help you out instead?"

Emily stepped back, "Excuse me, I'll be right back."

As soon as Emily turned away, Mr. Sunglasses stood abruptly.

This shameless woman was just too much!

The assistant chuckled, "Boss, take it easy!"

Mr. Sunglasses glanced towards the break room before sitting down again, adjusting his sunglasses with a hint of irritation.

The assistant watched Emily's retreating figure, clicking his tongue in admiration, "Boss, if you're not interested, maybe you could pass her to me?"

"You want to catch something?" Mr. Sunglasses replied dryly.

"..."

A short while later, Emily returned from the restroom, having cleaned up the coffee stains and changed into an even more revealing outfit. She approached with the same sultry smile, her voice as smooth as ever, "Would you like to try out our fitness equipment, sir? That way, we can recommend the best personal trainer for you."

Mr. Sunglasses got up and headed towards the equipment, preferring to spend time with the machines rather than interacting with Emily.

He started his workout routine, clearly familiar with the equipment as if he had spent countless hours in a gym.

The assistant cheered him on with exaggerated enthusiasm, "Go boss! You're amazing!"

Emily approached the assistant, "If you're not working out, why don't you grab a coffee?"

The assistant noticed she was trying to get rid of him, "Well, I might just take a bathroom break."

He leaned in, whispering, "Just a heads up—my boss is a tough nut to crack. Might be easier to flirt with me!"

Emily laughed, "You're just a sidekick, not worth my effort."

The assistant feigned tears.

Mr. Sunglasses continued his workout, ignoring Emily's attempts to assist. He knew his way around the gym equipment, using it with practiced ease.

Emily watched, genuinely impressed by his physique. If she initially aimed to secure a client for the club, she now found herself genuinely interested in the man.

After several minutes, Mr. Sunglasses lay down on the bench press, lifting weights with ease. Emily leaned over him, offering to spot him.

Olivia returned to the lounge, only to find Emily leaning precariously close to Mr. Sunglasses' face as he worked out.

Realizing her timing was off, Olivia quickly turned away, only to hear a loud yelp behind her, "Ah—"
