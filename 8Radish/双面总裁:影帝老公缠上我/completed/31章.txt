Ethan King was sprawled awkwardly on the couch, his legs dangling off the edge. He was uncomfortable and kept one ear out for any sound from the other room, making it impossible to fall asleep. 

Suddenly, he heard Isabella Peterson's door open, and he sat up quickly, only to be met with a puff of mist right in his face. Before he knew what was happening, he fell back onto the couch, dazed. 

Lucas Wright popped up from beside the couch, holding a bottle of pepper spray, looking quite pleased with himself. "Trying to mess up my boss's plans? Not a chance!"

Meanwhile, Isabella Peterson was focused on Olivia Stewart’s closed door, not noticing the commotion. He leaned against the wall for a moment, then knocked softly, "Knock, knock..."

Olivia Stewart opened the door, her hair a tousled mess, rubbing her sleepy eyes and yawning. "What’s up in the middle of the night?"

The moment she saw it was Isabella Peterson, her yawn was cut short, and she moved to close the door. Isabella quickly stuck his leg in the way. 

Her sleepiness evaporated, replaced by a wary expression. "What do you want?"

"I can't sleep."

Well, so what? How was that her problem? Olivia shot a glance at the quiet living room, not wanting to wake everyone up, so she whispered angrily, "Count stars if you can’t sleep."

"Want to join?"

Olivia let out a huge yawn, "Isabella, I’m not as smart as you, but don’t insult my intelligence!"

In the middle of the night, a guy and a girl counting stars together? Yeah, right. 

"Or," Isabella reached out, playfully twirling a loose strand of her hair around his finger, "I could count your hair."

Olivia rolled her eyes dramatically, "Why not count the hairs on my arm while you’re at it?"

"Now that’s a better idea! My girl is so smart!"

When did she become "his girl"? He might have said he was chasing her, but she hadn’t agreed to anything yet!

Not wanting to continue this banter, Olivia tried to close the door again. "If you’re really bored, count your own toes!"

Isabella leaned against the doorframe, preventing it from closing. "I’d rather count yours."

He grinned mischievously, and Olivia's temper flared. "Isabella, are you done yet? Move your paws away, I need to sleep. Do whatever you want somewhere else!"

"How about lending me a pillow?"

"Sure!" Olivia blurted out, eager to send him on his way.

Isabella’s gaze roamed over her, as if scanning her from head to toe. "I think you’d make the perfect pillow."

"Get out!"

"I promise, just a hug, no touching!"

Olivia gave him a skeptical look, "You really expect me to believe that?"

"Heh, you’re so adorable, it makes me want to..." Isabella suddenly leaned in, "kiss you!"

Olivia stepped back, her back pressing against the door. Isabella’s impossibly handsome face was so close that a slight move would bring their lips together. 

Her eyes darted away, avoiding his deep gaze, knowing she might lose her resolve. 

Ugh, why did he have to be so good-looking? Why did he always pull this trick on her? 

She knew she was a sucker for a pretty face, but why did Isabella have to be so handsome? 

Isabella watched Olivia with interest, the dim light revealing her cheeks turning red. 

The silence around them, broken only by their quickening breaths, created an intense atmosphere. 

Olivia couldn't take it anymore and pressed her dry lips together. Isabella seized the moment and kissed her deeply. 

Her mind slowly drifted, her body growing weak. If not for Isabella's arm around her waist, she might have slid down to the floor. 

When they finally parted, both were slightly breathless. 

Isabella brushed his fingers over her flushed cheek, chuckling softly, "You act like you don't like it, but you do."

Olivia clung to her remaining rationality, "And you? With your cleanliness obsession, why would you..."

Isabella froze. 

Yes, he had a thing about cleanliness, both physically and mentally. He knew Olivia had a past boyfriend and didn't like him, yet he couldn’t help himself. 

Maybe everyone encounters someone who makes them break all their own rules. 

As Isabella paused, Olivia let out a quiet sigh, a hint of sadness in her eyes. 

The night breeze stirred the curtains, letting in a sliver of moonlight that framed their silhouettes in a beautiful, serene picture. 

Isabella's hand moved again, tracing from Olivia’s cheek down her neck. She quickly stopped him, "No!"

Her voice trembled. 

Isabella paused, then reached for the buttons on her pajamas.

"What are you doing?"

Olivia shivered, hurriedly swatting his hand away.

"Your button came undone, thought I’d help."

A bald-faced lie—he was the one who unbuttoned it! 

Olivia quickly tried to button it back up, but Isabella caught her hand. 

In the soft moonlight, Olivia’s exposed skin looked like smooth, warm marble. 

Isabella didn’t hesitate to lean in. 

Last night, her spaghetti strap nightgown almost got her into trouble, and tonight, even in modest long sleeves and pants, she couldn’t escape. 

Turning her face away, Olivia closed her eyes, "You promised not to touch me!"

Her voice had a teary edge. 

"I’m not touching you, just a kiss."

"Where are you kissing?"

"You owe me 199 kisses, but you never specified where."

"..."

The night was cool and quiet, the moon hiding behind clouds, leaving only the gentle rustle of curtains.

The next morning. 

Lucas Wright, the ever-efficient butler, had arranged for a lavish breakfast to be delivered, a perfect balance of taste and nutrition. 

Ethan King woke up refreshed, without a single dream all night, but his mood was black as coal, especially when he saw Lucas. His eyes glared with a fiery intensity.

Lucas beamed like a contented Buddha, "Ethan, come on, we’re all under the same roof. Let’s not make things awkward."

Ethan shot him another glare, "Don’t think I don’t know what you did last night!"

Lucas continued smiling, his tone a little smug, "What I did isn’t important. What my boss did is!"

"You... if anything happens to Olivia Stewart, I’ll have it out with Isabella!"

Lucas glanced at the quiet room where Olivia was, "Does she seem like anything’s wrong? Ethan, you must see that while Olivia might say no, she doesn’t really resist my boss. As her friend, shouldn’t you be happy for her and supportive?"

Ethan stood there, speechless, his expression darkening. 

"Maybe Olivia holds a special place for you, and that makes it hard to watch. If so, maybe it’s best to leave, and spare yourself the heartache."

"You think you can manipulate me? No way! Olivia is smart; she won’t let Isabella have his way!"

"Stubborn youth," Lucas shook his head, "Just a friendly warning—you can’t compete with my boss! Besides, if Olivia liked you, she would have already."

Ethan paled. That last line hit him right where it hurt. 

Maybe from the start, when he entered Olivia’s life, he shouldn’t have been just her friend. 

But back then, he only saw her as a friend, and then, things changed, and words became harder to say. 

Olivia and Isabella both woke up late, emerging from their respective rooms at the same time, as if in sync. 

Lucas quickly set the breakfast table, preparing individual servings to cater to Isabella’s tastes. 

As they gathered around the small table, Isabella still looked a bit out of place. Thankfully, Olivia was next to him, and after a slight frown, he began to eat with his usual grace. 

Olivia kept her head down, avoiding eye contact with anyone. 

Ethan’s mood was dark, his eyes filled with melancholy. 

Everyone was lost in their own thoughts, except for the carefree Emma Thomas, who was happily slurping her breakfast smoothie. 

"Can you not slurp like that? It’s like eating with a pig!" 

Ethan snapped, causing Emma to immediately lower her head. 

Olivia nudged Ethan with her elbow, whispering, "Chill out!"

Reluctantly, Ethan apologized, "Uh, sorry about that, I was a bit harsh."

Olivia shook her head, sighing internally. 

Why Ethan? Why did he have to like Ethan? It was a puzzle with no solution. 

Breakfast was a subdued affair. 

Afterward, Isabella settled into his personal armchair, reading the financial news, occasionally peeking over the paper at Olivia’s room. 

Suddenly, the door opened, and Olivia stepped out, her hair in a high ponytail, wearing an off-shoulder T-shirt and denim shorts, with a crossbody bag, looking vibrant and youthful, especially those long, slender legs. 

Isabella’s eyes lit up, setting the paper aside. "Want to hang out with me? I might be busy today."

What an ego! 

Olivia flashed him a dazzling smile, waving her hand, "Off to work, bye!"

Work? 

Dressed like that, what kind of work?

Isabella shot up, grabbed the door handle, and glared at Olivia.

"Go back and change!"
