1章：Rescue the Rival

Isabella Peterson glanced sideways at Lucas Wright, her loyal but often exasperating assistant. "Old man, don't think I don't know what you're up to. You're just worried I'll get over there and wipe them out, aren't you? Since I gave her the money to save him, I'm not going to take action!"

Lucas wiped the sweat off his brow nervously. "Boss, I'm just concerned about your health. The doctor said you can't get angry or stressed out anymore!"

Isabella kicked forward, feigning an attack. "I just want to see what kind of dramatic life-and-death scene they're staging to provoke me!"

Lucas didn't dare dodge, watching as Isabella's foot swung close but didn't make contact. He knew she wasn't serious; with her skills, if she wanted to hit him, she wouldn't miss.

Seeing that he couldn't dissuade her, Lucas reluctantly called for the doctor and the bodyguards to follow.

Isabella drove her sports car at top speed, her convoy of bodyguard vehicles trailing behind like a black serpent weaving through the streets. She kept an eye out for Olivia Stewart while deftly handling the wheel. Olivia had taken off in a black sedan that was nothing like their security cars—easy to distinguish at first glance.

But after ten minutes, with Isabella speeding out of the city and onto the highway, Olivia was nowhere to be seen.

"Could that woman make the car fly? How desperate is she to deliver cash to that pretty boy?"

Frustrated, Isabella punched the steering wheel. "Idiot! If you get into an accident, how will you save him? If you dare get yourself hurt, I won't be cleaning up the mess!"

Despite her harsh words, Isabella didn't dare slack off. She scanned the traffic intently, her eyes like searchlights.

The convoy raced into the thriving new district of Peach Town. Once off the highway, Isabella called Michael Wright. "Which hospital?"

"Huh?" Michael was utterly confused.

"I said, which hospital is the dying Ethan King in?" Isabella yelled, anger boiling over.

His woman was rushing to save another man's life, and here he was, having to chase her down. What was this madness?

Michael, still bewildered, stammered, "The, uh, First People's Hospital."

Isabella punched the address into the GPS, and her Bugatti roared towards the hospital.

Within five minutes, Isabella was outside the emergency room, face-to-face with Michael.

"Where is he?"

"Still in the ER. The docs say he's got internal bleeding and can't be moved. The facilities here are limited. Without hiring top-notch specialists, he won't last three days."

"I don't care if he dies!" Isabella grabbed Michael by the collar. "I'm asking you where Olivia Stewart is! Where's she?"

Not seeing her bodyguard car downstairs made Isabella uneasy, so she had sprinted up here.

"Olivia Stewart? I haven't seen her!" Michael was completely at a loss.

"You're saying Olivia didn't come?"

"No, boss! I thought you were here to visit her friend, so I rushed over too!"

Michael had been investigating some old matters and missed the scene at the coffee shop. He thought Isabella wanted to care for Olivia's friend out of consideration for her. Little did he know, Isabella wanted Ethan King out of the picture entirely.

Isabella coldly released Michael, glanced at the ER, and ordered Lucas, "Ask the doctors!"

If Olivia was coming, she'd have contacted Ethan's doctor already. She'd be arranging for specialists and bringing the money soon.

Lucas quickly returned, shaking his head. "The doctors said the person who brought him here fled before he left the ER. No one else has visited. It seems Olivia doesn't know Ethan's in trouble. He had no ID, and they're asking if we can help find his family."

Isabella ignored the last part and turned to leave. "Find Sophie Cook's address immediately!"

If Olivia didn't know about Ethan's accident, then the only person who could make her drop everything was Sophie.

Taking a few steps, Isabella stopped and looked back at the ER's glass doors. She instructed Michael, "Stay here and get a medical team. Make sure he survives."

"Yes, boss!"

Michael nodded and went off to fulfill the order.

Lucas watched Isabella with a hint of relief. "Boss, Olivia will be happy you helped."

"I'm just repaying the favor she owes him, so she can't keep saying how he stayed by her side when she was down. Once that's settled, they're done."

Isabella hurried down the stairs to her car, adding, "Don't tell her, at least not until he's stable."

Lucas nodded, handing Isabella a location update from David Wright.

Isabella's face turned a multitude of colors. How could she make such a rookie mistake?

Every bodyguard vehicle in Group Peterson had a tracker, and yet in her panic, she'd forgotten, chasing Olivia all over the place. And her whole convoy had followed her blindly!

Isabella's face was as sour as if she'd swallowed a fly.

Lucas, sweating but not daring to wipe it, bowed. "Boss, your car was so fast, everyone just focused on keeping up with you. I, I forgot too, just realized now."

"You old fool!" Isabella glared at Lucas, raising her foot but then lowering it again.

This old butler had been tirelessly taking care of her, and the dark circles under his eyes hadn't faded.

"Boss, if you want to punish me, there's time for that later. We should go check on Olivia. She looked like she was in trouble today."

His words resonated with Isabella.

Pushing the car to its limits again, she led her convoy down Gold Avenue, a striking and audacious sight.

Meanwhile, in a small apartment, Sophie Cook was on her knees, surrounded by men with tattoos and sinister expressions. She was crying her heart out.

These were former associates of Sophie, back when she'd borrowed money from their boss, Scar. After Scar and Henry Adams got arrested, Sophie thought she'd escaped her troubles. But here they were again.

"Please, Brother Qing, give me a few more days. I really have no money right now," Sophie pleaded, tears streaming down her face.

Brother Qing, flicking a knife, smirked. "You know Scar's rules. What, now that he's gone, you don't respect me?"

"No, no!" Sophie shook her head frantically. "I just..."

Qing suddenly pointed the knife at her throat, the blade lifting her chin.

She froze, feeling the cold steel nick her skin, a sharp pain spreading.

Looking up, she met Qing's harsh gaze, shivering violently.

"Brother Qing..." She tried to sound sweet, her eyes teary but full of charm.

"Cut the act!" Qing said with disgust. "You think I'm still interested in you? Take a look at yourself!"

Sophie's face went pale. In her attempt to garner sympathy, she'd forgotten her scarred face. With her makeup washed away by tears, no wonder Qing wasn't tempted!

Thinking of her face, a flicker of malice crossed Sophie's features.

Olivia Stewart, this is all your fault!

Don't blame me for dragging you into this mess!

Composing herself, Sophie put on a smile. "Brother Qing, I know it's my fault for not repaying on time, but I can offer you a good deal as compensation."

"Oh?" Qing raised an eyebrow, pushing the knife a bit deeper. "If you're tricking me, don't blame me for what happens."

Sophie took a deep breath, suppressing the pain. "You heard my call with my sister. I have no money, but she's the leading lady opposite a famous actor..."

"Don't mention your sister! Where's the money she promised? If she calls the cops, I'll make sure your face ends up looking like a spider web!"

Qing threatened, twisting the knife slightly. Sophie felt warm liquid trickling down her neck.

As for the pain, she was already numb.
