This is for Olivia Stewart.

At the luxurious Stewart Estate, the butler presented an exquisite large box to Grace Martin. "Madam, this is the evening gown designed by the top Italian designer, Camille, as ordered by Mr. Stewart."

"Camille? The renowned designer from Italy? Let me see!" Mia Stewart couldn't contain her excitement and leaned in closer, her eyes sparkling.

The butler hesitated and bowed slightly. "Miss Mia, Mr. Stewart specifically mentioned that this is for Miss Olivia."

"What?" Mia's hand, reaching for the box, stopped mid-air, frozen in disbelief.

"She's just an illegitimate child. Why should she get such special treatment?" Grace Martin, lounging on the sofa, looked as displeased as ever. She despised the clich√© of mistresses rising to power, and Olivia Stewart was a constant reminder of that narrative. Years ago, Sophia Allen had snatched her man, and now Sophia's daughter was contending for Mia's affection. It was infuriating!

"This gown is for Mia, and that's final!" Grace Martin's voice was icy cold.

"I'm afraid that's not possible," the butler said, bowing his head even lower, not daring to say more. "Mr. Stewart gave strict instructions."

"Hmph! Who cares? I bet my dress will be even more stunning!" Mia scoffed, retracting her hand and lifting her chin arrogantly. "Alfred, bring me my gown!"

The butler lowered his head even more. "I'm sorry, Miss Mia, but there is only one gown."

"What?" Mia shot up from her seat. "Is my dad really that biased? What are we supposed to do? Is he not planning to let us attend?"

The butler took a small step back, bowing to Grace and Mia. "Due to the exorbitant cost, Mr. Stewart could only secure one gown, even with all his connections. He asks that you prepare your own attire and ensure you make a grand entrance at the party."

"Ridiculous!" Grace Martin slammed her hand on the table in frustration. Seeing the line of servants behind the butler, each holding boxes of various sizes, she asked, "And what are those?"

The butler answered respectfully, "These are the accompanying jewelry, accessories, and high heels for the gown."

"They even prepared accessories?" Mia was astonished, eyeing the boxes with greed.

The butler dared not meet Grace's icy gaze as he continued, "Mr. Stewart instructed that, to foster some goodwill, you deliver these to Miss Olivia. She can choose what she wants, and the rest is for you."

"Deliver it to her? And use what's left?" Mia pointed to herself, nearly fuming.

Certain she hadn't misheard, Mia clung to Grace's arm, pouting. "Mom, look how biased Dad is! You have to stand up for me!"

Grace felt a wave of frustration rising within her. She patted Mia's hand reassuringly. "Mia, take these things. I'll handle your father. He won't kick us out over that illegitimate child."

"Absolutely not!" The butler forced himself to interrupt Grace.

"Mr. Stewart said if you mess this up, you won't get a penny of spending money in the future!"

Grace and Mia froze.

Over the years, they had lived a life of shopping and leisure, with no income of their own. Without Stewart's financial support, they had nothing.

After a long silence, Grace finally erupted. "Stewart! How dare he! He was just a laborer hauling materials for our family. Without us, would he be where he is today? Now he plays around and even mistreats us! Mia, pack your things, we're leaving!"

"Okay." Mia responded quickly but didn't move.

Leave? Where to? Without the Stewart family, they were nothing.

Grace, still fuming, began rolling up her sleeves. "Mia, didn't you hear your mother?"

"Grace! Leaving, are you? Then leave for good!" came a thunderous voice from the hall, followed by Stewart's imposing figure.

Seeing Stewart's fury, Grace's defiance crumbled, though she maintained a cold front. "You finally came back?"

Stewart stormed up to Grace and pointed toward the door. "If you're leaving, pack up your things and get out. Now!"

Grace was stunned, staring up at Stewart's towering form, unable to speak. She'd only been venting, not seriously planning to leave. But Stewart seemed to have taken her words literally.

"Honey, I..."

"Get out!"

Stewart's repeated command for her to leave finally enraged Grace, and she placed her hands on her hips, yelling, "Stewart, you ungrateful swine! If it weren't for our family..."

"Enough!"

Stewart cut her off with a slap, leaving Grace's cheek red and swollen. She clutched her face, incredulous. "You dare hit me?"

"Hmph!" Stewart sneered, his voice harsh. "If it weren't for me, your family would have collapsed long ago! They only married you to me for my business acumen, not because you were some prize!"

Ever since their marriage, Grace had never let him forget how her family had supposedly lifted him out of poverty. But he'd had enough of her constant reminders and public humiliations.

Had he not overheard her outrageous comments upon entering the hall, he might not have been so determined to see her gone. Nor would he have torn open the deepest, most painful wound in their marriage.

Grace stared at Stewart's disdainful expression, her face turning from red to white, her defiance and bitterness replaced by fear and shame. When she married Stewart, she hadn't been pure, and apparently, he had known all along.

For years, she'd tried to control his wandering eye, only to fail repeatedly. Now she understood why.

Tears welled in her eyes, and Grace, unable to endure the humiliation, turned and fled upstairs, sobbing.

Seeing things take a turn for the worse, Mia dared not demand the gown and hurried after her mother.

Stewart's face was a mask of coldness. He glared at the butler before issuing his orders. "Tell them to play their part. If they ruin the welcome party, they'll have to leave!"

Grace had gained nothing from her outburst, not even a slap for her troubles. After venting her grievances, she had no choice but to swallow her pride.

Over the years, the Martin family had fallen, while Stewart had used their resources to build his own empire. He could easily cut her off at any moment.

After much contemplation, Grace decided to temporarily comply, planning to deal with Olivia once she was back in the family.

The next morning, Grace and Mia rose early. They prepared themselves meticulously, gathered the butler and servants, and set off with the high-end evening gown and jewelry boxes.

The serene neighborhood they entered was renowned for its tranquility, but their large entourage attracted quite the attention.

Despite her inner resentment, Grace had mastered the art of social grace. Smiling at onlookers, she explained, "We just found out we have another daughter. The welcome party is soon. She's grown up in a modest family, so I'm bringing these gowns and accessories for her to choose from and giving her some etiquette lessons for the party."

Mia stood by with a forced smile.

While some praised their actions, others were skeptical. "Isn't Olivia a pop sensation? She's attended countless high-end events with billionaires. Why would she need etiquette lessons?"

Grace's composure faltered, and she quickly turned away, heading inside.

At the community gate, they were subjected to rigorous questioning and only allowed entry after Olivia's approval, sparking more public chatter.

"Seems like the Stewart family is eager to claim her."

"True, Olivia's a celebrity in her own right, and she has wealthy backers!"

Grace, embarrassed by the whispers, quickened her pace, urging Mia to follow.

Mia pouted, "What kind of neighborhood is this? The houses are so short, the gardens so small, yet the security is so strict! Why do we need Olivia's approval to enter? It's not her property!"

"Enough complaining!" Grace snapped, her voice filled with suppressed anger.

Mia rolled her eyes and muttered, "Olivia must be a real charmer! Not only is Isabella completely smitten, but even the security guards are under her spell!"

Mia didn't know that while the community wasn't Olivia's, the guards were placed there by Ethan King. Who else would they listen to?

Grace's frustration only grew. Sophia, once a mere maid, had seduced Stewart, and after sending her away to marry an unattractive man, Grace never imagined she'd have to grovel for her daughter's acceptance decades later.

Taking deep breaths to calm herself, Grace led Mia into the building, both feeling apprehensive about their past encounters with Olivia.

Would Olivia accept them?
