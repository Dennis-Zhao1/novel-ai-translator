Title: Secrets and Lies

---

Olivia Stewart's face turned as white as a sheet. Alexander Peterson looked at her with a painful expression.

"Even though I managed to save you just in time, given the situation, how could he ever believe in your innocence?"

No! Olivia thought desperately. Isabella Peterson would believe her! A flicker of determination sparked in her eyes.

"Besides, you know how obsessive-compulsive he is about cleanliness and order," Alexander's words were like the final straw that broke Olivia's resolve.

Isabella stormed back to the Peterson estate, heading straight for the old man's study. Without a word, the old man had his assistant show Isabella the video.

The footage showed Olivia surrounded by guards, going from restrained to tearing at her clothes, desperately clinging to a burly guard like a lifeline. The video cut off abruptly, leaving everything else to the imagination.

"Bang!" Isabella punched the TV, blood trickling from his knuckles as he glared at the old man. "You coward!"

The old man's face was stony. "No matter what you think, this is the reality now."

"I refuse to believe it!" Isabella retorted, his voice firm. "Even if it were true, I wouldn't care!"

"You..." The old man's finger trembled furiously at Isabella. "Give her up, or I don't know what I'll do to your brother!"

Isabella turned on his heel, leaving without another word. The old man yelled after him, but it was futile.

As Isabella exited the study, his mother, Mrs. Peterson, intercepted him in a panic. "Son, did you upset your father again?"

Isabella shook off her grip. "Don't let me find out you're involved in this!"

"How could you think that?" she replied, feigning hurt. "That woman is still with your brother!"

"What did you just say?" Isabella asked, eyes narrowing as he turned to leave.

Mrs. Peterson grabbed his arm tightly. "Son, don't get involved in this mess! Your father already overlooks you. Don't go against him anymore. Just marry into the White family. We don't need someone like her!"

"Mom!" Isabella cut her off coldly, his eyes burning with anger. "Say something like that again, and I'm no longer your son!"

"You... do you know, before she cared for you, Olivia had a boyfriend? And that man was Alexander Peterson!"

Isabella froze.

"And the child she was expecting back then was definitely Alexander's!"

"Because you, you can't have children!"

Alexander had always been a loyal follower of the old man, never defying him. Yet this time, he risked everything to rescue Olivia and bring her to his room...

Isabella's ears rang, drowning out his mother's words. The word "infertile" echoed through his mind like a curse, intensifying his headache.

Mrs. Peterson realized her slip, quickly covering her mouth, looking at Isabella in fear. "Son, are you okay?"

Isabella's fists clenched, reopening the wounds on his hands. "Tell me, this isn't true!" he demanded, his voice hoarse with pain.

Mrs. Peterson sighed deeply. "Come with me."

A voice inside Isabella screamed not to go, reminding him of Olivia's amnesia years ago, but his feet moved of their own accord.

How could a young, healthy man like him be infertile? Anyone hearing such news would be thrown into chaos!

Mrs. Peterson led him to her room, carefully shutting the door and drawing the curtains before presenting a small box. "Here, this is the contract Olivia signed with me. She took a huge sum of money but never fulfilled her promise. She's just after the money!"

Isabella felt a wave of disappointment. "Mom, if you're still trying to slander my woman, don't waste my time!"

Mrs. Peterson quickly handed him another document. "This is your medical record!"

Hesitantly, Isabella took the thin sheets of paper, which felt impossibly heavy.

The words on the page were clear: Isabella's sperm count was low, with poor mobility and survival rates. The chances of impregnating someone were virtually zero.

Isabella's hands trembled, the papers slipping through his fingers.

"When did you find out? Why didn't you tell me?" Isabella roared, his voice raw with anguish.

Mrs. Peterson wiped her tears. "The family doctor discovered it two years ago during your check-up. We were afraid you couldn't handle it, so only your father, brother, and I knew."

Isabella's lips pressed into a thin line. No wonder his mother had been urging him to find a woman, even suggesting adopting a child. It all made sense now.

"Son, that woman is staying with your brother. He must have told her about this, and they were a couple before..."

"Bang!" Isabella's fist hit the table, sending a set of antique porcelain crashing to the floor.

"Son..." Mrs. Peterson called out, but he ignored her, storming away.

He couldn't believe Olivia would betray him! Yet doubt nagged at him.

What would Olivia do if she knew he couldn't have children? Would she leave him for Alexander?

The thought made him halt in his tracks, his mind racing with insecurity. Despite his wealth, looks, and skills, he felt vulnerable.

Maybe Olivia wouldn't mind? Or perhaps she would be open to adopting a child?

Isabella had never been this indecisive, but he steeled himself, moving forward. Olivia was still his woman, and he couldn't let her stay with Alexander!

As he rounded a corner, he saw Alexander's cottage ahead. But the sight before him felt like a dagger to the heart.

Near the rose bushes, Olivia and Alexander were hugging as if nothing else existed in the world.

"Careful! You’re so clumsy, even walking is a challenge for you!" Alexander scolded gently, his eyes filled with affection—the kind a man has for a woman.

Isabella strode forward, his fist connecting with Alexander's face.

"Ugh!" Alexander staggered back, blood dripping from his nose.

Olivia, caught off guard, had been trying to move her twisted ankle when Alexander hugged her. She was about to push away when Isabella's punch landed.

"Alex!" Olivia cried instinctively.

Alex! How intimate!

Isabella stepped closer to Olivia, his steps heavy with disappointment. "He's just a nobody, and yet you prefer him?"

Olivia backed away, shocked. "Isabella..."

"Olivia Stewart, you've let me down," Isabella said coldly, turning away.

Olivia bit her lip, tears welling up but stubbornly refusing to fall. He cared! Despite nothing happening, he believed the worst!

Alexander slowly stood, adjusting his glasses. A calculating glint flashed in his eyes. "Olivia, should I go explain to Isabella?"

"No need," Olivia replied, sniffling. "If he knows me, there's no need for an explanation. If he doesn't, it won't matter."

Alexander hugged her gently. "Don't think too much, Olivia. Let's go back. Maybe Isabella will come around."

Olivia stood still. "Alex, can you let me go?"

Isabella, consumed by jealousy, wouldn't have guessed that "Alex" was just an old habit of Olivia's.

Alexander pushed up his glasses, a reluctant look on his face. "Olivia, it’s not that I don’t want to let you go. When I saved you from that room, I angered the old man. Staying with me is the safest option for now."

The light in Olivia's eyes dimmed, and she quietly followed Alexander back to his cottage.

Not far away, Isabella stood behind the rose bushes, his face dark as he watched them walk away.

That night, a servant brought Isabella his usual glass of warm milk before bed. Isabella, feeling restless, swatted it away. "Take it away!"

The servant dropped to their knees, holding the tray above their head. "Sir, you should drink it while it's warm!"

Isabella’s mind flashed back to Olivia calling him "Sir" with a playful grin. Now, that infuriating woman was laughing with his brother!

The image felt like swallowing a burning acid, searing from his throat to his heart!

"Crash!" Isabella knocked the glass onto the floor, the milk and shattered glass scattering everywhere.

"Sir!" The servant gasped. "That's your medicine!"
