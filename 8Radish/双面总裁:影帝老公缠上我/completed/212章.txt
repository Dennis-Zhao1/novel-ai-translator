If you come over here, I'll jump!

Isabella Peterson caught sight of Olivia Stewart, a tall young woman who seemed chilled out on the surface but carried an intimidating aura that made anyone second guess messing with her. Isabella knew it was wise not to tangle with such people; her toughness was all in her heart, unlike the kind that people wear on their faces.

Isabella flashed an ingratiating smile at Olivia, quickly beckoning her sidekicks to speed up their exit. 

David Wright stepped forward to report, "Boss, these guys are loan sharks. Their leader got caught a while back, and they've been quiet for some time. Looks like these are just some stragglers."

Olivia coldly replied, "Handle it."

"Yes, Boss!" David replied, rushing off to handle the situation.

Lucas Wright sighed in relief, grinning, "Boss, it seems Olivia managed to scrounge up the money to help her sister." He chuckled, "See, you were worried for nothing."

"Helping women like that is just plain stupid!" Olivia scoffed before turning to leave.

"Hey...Boss! Aren't you going to check on Olivia?"

If everything's settled, what's the point? Olivia paused, "Just give her a call to make sure she's safe. Don't let her know we came by."

Lucas gave Olivia a helpless glance, "Got it, Boss."

Dialing Olivia's number, Lucas put on his friendliest face, "Olivia, where are you right now? Everything okay?"

"I'm fine. Got caught up with something today. Tell Olivia I'll be back first thing tomorrow, I promise!" Olivia's cool voice came through, laden with a hint of detachment. Despite its clear and pleasant tone, it somehow left a chill in the air.

Looks like Olivia is truly upset! Lucas held the phone, glancing at Olivia: Boss, want to say something? Maybe apologize?

Olivia's face twisted awkwardly as she hung up the call, giving the order, "Let's go."

Even in the car, Olivia's lips were pressed tight with frustration.

Lucas hesitated before speaking, "Boss, don't be mad. Olivia probably kept it a secret for a reason. After all, Sophie is just a girl, and dealing with loan sharks like that...it can ruin one's reputation..."

"Reputation? That girl has done worse than this. And Olivia keeps falling for it!"

"Olivia's not stupid; she's just too sentimental..."

"Sentimental? Helping that coward is sentimental? Helping Sophie is sentimental? And what about my feelings? Where does she place them?"

Watching Olivia's petulant expression, Lucas almost laughed. The old Olivia was always so composed and focused, especially in business, never showing much emotion. When did she start acting so immature? Olivia must be the cure for her!

"Old man, what's so funny?"

"Was I laughing?" Lucas quickly put on a serious face, "I was just wondering how you plan to make it up to Olivia. She's really angry this time."

Olivia fell silent.

"Sometimes, showing a bit of vulnerability in front of women isn't a bad thing. Like your stomach ulcer..."

"Get lost!"

Lucas scurried to the side but soon shuffled back, "Boss, that video of Olivia and Ethan King... I got a copy and had a lip-reading expert decode their conversation. Want to see it?"

Olivia hesitated, then said, "Bring it here."

The video was short, just a few minutes, mostly showing Ethan's one-sided obsession. At the end, he forced a kiss. As much as it stung to watch, Olivia had to admit she had misunderstood Olivia.

Especially one line: "I've already fallen for him!"

No matter how many times she heard it, it was music to her ears.

Olivia replayed that part over and over.

Lucas watched from the side, sighing. The boss's childish side was showing again.

As a seasoned manager, he felt it was his duty to remind her, "Boss, maybe you should apologize to Olivia."

Olivia set down the tablet, a hint of embarrassment on her face, "What I do is none of your business."

Lucas wiped the sweat from his brow, "Of course not! But, Boss, this can't wait. This misunderstanding has gone too far, and you were really harsh with Olivia..."

Olivia stubbornly twisted her lips, "I'll deal with it when she gets back! Collect all the dirt on Sophie, every embarrassing thing she's done, especially the stuff framing Olivia!"

"Yes, Boss!"

It seemed the boss was finally going to deal with Sophie. If it weren't for Olivia's sake, would she have tolerated her this long? It's time to cut out this toxic influence, painful as it might be, for Olivia's sake.

Olivia frowned, deep in thought. How to apologize to Olivia without losing face? This felt harder than coding a new software program!

Before Olivia could come up with the perfect plan, news broke out about Olivia!

Early the next morning, Olivia's scandalous photos went viral online, causing a massive uproar. The media company's website was hacked, and they faced an unprecedented PR crisis.

When Olivia got the call, they didn't dare say it was Olivia involved, just that a celebrity's photos had leaked, causing chaos. She threw on a coat and sunglasses, rushing out the door.

Olivia was with Sophie, so she hadn't paid attention to the internet. Sophie had cried all night, and they'd only just fallen asleep at dawn, completely unaware of the bombshell that had dropped.

The urgent ringing of Olivia's work phone jolted her awake. She hadn’t been to the set in days; was the director calling to chew her out?

Frantically, Olivia answered, "Hello?"

"Olivia, where are you? What dumb thing have you done while skipping work?"

Olivia was clueless, "I didn't do anything!"

"You still don't know? Your photos are everywhere online, trending number one on every site! Even our company's site got hacked! Hide immediately, and don't let the tabloids find you!"

Her phone slipped from her hand, crashing to the floor.

"What's wrong, sis?" Sophie asked, rubbing her eyes, still half asleep.

"They said... my pictures are all over the internet!"

Olivia snapped awake, rushing to her laptop.

A sly grin briefly crossed Sophie's face before she feigned concern, scrambling to Olivia's side, "How could this happen?"

Olivia couldn't bear to look, staring blankly at the screen. Suddenly, she turned to Sophie, "These pictures... are they yours?"

Sophie burst into tears.

"Those bastards! They took the money and still posted them online? I'm going to fight them!"

Sophie tried to storm out, but Olivia grabbed her, "Sophie, calm down! No one knows it's you! It's my name on this mess!"

"…"

Sophie widened her eyes in shock, clicking through several sites. Sure enough, they all shouted: "Innocent Star, Olivia Stewart’s Scandalous Pics!"

"This…"

Greedy hackers leaked the photos after being paid off, but they had no idea the mastermind was Sophie herself.

Sophie laughed inwardly but wore a face of tears, "Sis, I doomed you! I’ll clear this up; I’d rather ruin myself than you!"

Olivia held her back, "You can't go anywhere! The paparazzi will make everything worse if they find us!"

"No, Sis, this is my fault. I'd rather disappear than drag you down!"

Sophie wailed, and as Olivia momentarily loosened her grip, Sophie broke free, dashing outside.

"Sophie! Sophie!"

Olivia chased after her, only to see Sophie climbing the balcony.

"Sophie, don’t!"

Sophie clung shakily to the balcony rail, her body trembling with emotion, "Don't come any closer! I'll jump if you do!"

"Okay, okay, I'm not moving! Sophie, let's talk this out!" Olivia pleaded from a few steps away, watching Sophie with a mix of worry and helplessness.

Sophie cried out to the street below, "You’ve got it wrong! The pictures aren’t my sister’s, they’re mine!"

The balcony faced a busy road, and a scene like this naturally drew attention. With Sophie’s shout, it was impossible to ignore. Paparazzi who had been lying in wait for Olivia now had the perfect scoop and flocked over.

Sophie stood tall, tears streaming, repeating, "The person in those pictures isn't Olivia Stewart; it’s me, Sophie!"

Her words were the truth, yet said in such a pitiful tone, they only fueled speculation.

The paparazzi smelled a story, and one reporter shouted, "Did your sister force you to take the blame?"

"No! No! My sister didn’t force me!" Sophie shook her head vehemently, turning to Olivia, "Sis, stay back! One more step, and I'll jump!"
