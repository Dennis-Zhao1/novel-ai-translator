Holding Hands, Growing Old Together

The bodyguard had just dropped off Baek Jinsong at his place and was about to head back to his own quarters when his phone buzzed. It was a call from the main house. "Olivia Stewart wants to see you," the voice on the other end instructed.

Without missing a beat, the bodyguard made his way to Olivia Stewart's location. He found her by the fountain, staring intently at the mermaid sculpture as if lost in thought.

"Olivia Stewart," he greeted, bowing his head respectfully.

She turned, offering him a gentle smile. "Thank you for your hard work."

Caught off guard by her kindness, the bodyguard quickly bowed again. "You're too kind, Olivia Stewart."

After a moment, she asked, "How is she doing?"

The bodyguard blinked, momentarily confused. "She?" he questioned, unsure if Olivia was referring to a man or a woman.

"The one who got injured," Olivia clarified, her voice tinged with a hint of reluctance. Despite her decision to forgive Baek Jinsong and Grace Martin, calling them her parents was still difficult. Using their names felt too formal, so she settled on "she."

Realization dawned on the bodyguard, and he quickly reported, "She's managing to walk with a cane, but..."

He hesitated, trying to find the right words.

"Don’t worry about sugarcoating it," Olivia said with a firm look. "Just tell me the truth."

"Yes, Olivia Stewart," he replied, standing up straight. "From what I can see, they’re not being entirely truthful. I suspect Mrs. Baek has a minor fracture."

"A fracture?" Olivia gasped, her brows knitting together with concern. "That sounds serious. Why didn't they go to the hospital?"

The bodyguard hesitated again, but Olivia's stern expression prompted him to continue. "I don't think they did. Plus, the place they're living in... it looks like something scavengers would settle in."

Living like scavengers? Could they be in such dire straits? Weren't they supposed to have inherited a fortune? Where did all the money go?

Olivia suddenly recalled how Baek Jinsong and Grace Martin had approached her when they first returned to the city, wanting to give her the inheritance as a dowry. She had refused back then. Baek Jinsong had said something about signing over the inheritance if it ever came to that.

Those old fools! They sold everything when they left the city and now have nothing to their name. Despite having no income, they were trying to save every penny while still spending a fortune on ingredients to make her soup every day. No wonder they were struggling.

"Get Mr. Xi to handle this," Olivia instructed.

Once the bodyguard left to carry out her orders, Olivia, exasperated, picked up a small stone and tossed it into the fountain.

Mr. Xi quickly arranged for Grace Martin to be taken to the best orthopedic hospital. After a thorough examination, the doctors confirmed that she had indeed suffered a fracture, and it was quite severe.

The doctors ordered complete bed rest to prevent misalignment of the bone, which could hinder the healing process. But Grace was restless in the hospital and insisted that Baek Jinsong bring her kitchen tools to the hospital room. She directed him in making soup, timing each step meticulously.

Thanks to Grace's guidance, Baek Jinsong's cooking skills improved, and the soup he made wasn't half bad. So, even in the hospital, the couple ensured that Olivia Stewart received her daily dose of nourishing broth.

Initially, Olivia was reluctant to drink it, but Baek Jinsong pleaded, "Olivia, please have some compassion for Chloe Wright. Making soup for you is her only focus right now. And, this time, I made it with her instructions. Try it, see if it's any good."

With his eyes shining with childlike hope, Olivia couldn't refuse. She took the soup, saying softly, "You don't have to bring it to me every day. She needs you more right now."

As she was about to take a sip, she noticed something flashing from Baek Jinsong's pocket. Frowning, she asked, "What are you doing?"

Embarrassed, Baek Jinsong pulled out his phone, revealing a recording app still running on the screen. He looked at Olivia with a guilty expression, his face turning red.

"Olivia, I didn't mean anything by it! I just... every time I bring soup, I want to see you. Chloe has missed you so much, so I secretly record our conversations to play back for her. It makes her so happy! She listens to it over and over."

Olivia reached out her hand. "Give me your phone."

Reluctantly, like a child caught misbehaving, Baek Jinsong handed over his phone, his eyes fixed on Olivia's every move. What if she deleted the recordings? Chloe would be devastated.

Olivia examined the phone, noting its basic features. She opened the video app and turned the camera on herself, smiling slightly. "Stop fussing with your broken bone. Rest up, and I'll visit you soon."

Handing the phone back to Baek Jinsong, she said, "Go on, head back. Tomorrow, just call when the soup's ready, and I'll come over."

"Okay, okay!" Baek Jinsong replied, his hands trembling with excitement. He couldn't stop nodding in agreement.

The next day, Olivia Stewart kept her promise and visited Grace Martin in the hospital. With a boost in morale, Grace's recovery was swift. After two weeks, she was able to walk on her own, though she was advised to keep physical activity light. Most of the time, she was in a wheelchair, happily brewing soup for Olivia amid a sea of kitchenware.

Meanwhile, Mr. Xi arranged for a cozy house near Olivia's estate for the Baek couple. Once discharged, they'd have a new home to settle into.

Time flew by, and with just a week until May 20th, the Billionaire Group's website underwent a transformation. The homepage was awash in cheerful red, adorned with watermarked images of Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson's wedding photos, exuding elegance and romance.

Simultaneously, the trending game, "Send an Angel to Love You," updated its interface. The opening screen featured a side-profile shot of Olivia and Isabella gazing at each other with affection. Olivia was resplendent in a dreamy white wedding dress, her veil forming a graceful curve of happiness. Isabella, on the other hand, looked dashing in a white suit, his tall frame and chiseled features exuding an irresistible charm.

Isabella's personal social media account bore a new status update: "May 20th, from this moment on, holding hands, growing old together!"

The declaration was both grand and heartfelt, announcing their engagement and upcoming wedding.

Below the update was a stunning collection of romantic wedding photos.

During this time, Isabella had insisted on Olivia trying on every wedding dress in their dreamlike castle. He had even hired the world's renowned wedding photographers to capture a series of beautiful images.

Now, Isabella shared these photos with the world, proudly announcing his happiness.

The updates on the official website, game homepage, and social media were synchronized to go live at the same moment.

Within minutes, the entire city, and soon the entire internet, was buzzing with excitement. Cheers, admiration, and blessings poured in beneath the posts, nearly overwhelming the servers with the sheer volume of congratulatory comments.

Amidst the global commotion, Olivia Stewart remained blissfully unaware. Despite being the mother of several children, the thought of marriage still gave her pre-wedding jitters. The closer the big day approached, the more anxious she felt.

Alone in her room, she double-checked her wedding preparations and replayed the ceremony in her mind. Catching sight of her slightly furrowed brow in the mirror, she couldn't help but laugh at herself.

It's just a small wedding, she mused. What's there to panic about?

Giving her cheeks a gentle pat and coaxing a cheerful smile onto her lips, Olivia headed downstairs.

In the living room, two maids were glued to their phones, whispering and giggling.

Olivia descended the stairs, curiosity piqued. "What’s so funny?" she asked.

The maids jumped, caught red-handed. Stealing glances at each other, they knew they were slacking off during work hours, but still...

The round-faced maid held up her phone. "Olivia, you're so lucky! Look, the young master announced your engagement online! It's like a fairy tale romance!"

"A public announcement? I thought we agreed on a low-key wedding?" Olivia frowned, quickly checking her phone. As she scrolled through the posts, a smile involuntarily stretched across her face.

Oh, Isabella, what are you up to?

Known for his reserved nature, Isabella had never been one to flaunt their relationship online. He had even mocked those who did, claiming happiness was personal, not a performance for others. And yet, here he was, eager for the world to know about their wedding.

Olivia's gaze lingered on Isabella's heartfelt message, "Holding hands, growing old together."

So sweet.

With a grin, she shared the post, tagging Isabella. The gesture spoke volumes.

Olivia's social media account soon flooded with well-wishes. The voices that once doubted her were now replaced by kind words, celebrating the union of two souls.

When Olivia tagged Isabella, he was in the middle of a high-level meeting at the Billionaire Group. It was his last meeting before the wedding, where he finalized critical company decisions before whisking Olivia away for their honeymoon.

Upon seeing her message, Isabella couldn't stay put. He immediately picked up his phone and instructed the vice president, "Take over the meeting, and send me the minutes later."

His excitement was palpable; he couldn't wait another moment to see his beloved.

As the world showered them with blessings, the wedding day drew nearer. Unbeknownst to anyone, a storm was quietly brewing on the horizon...
