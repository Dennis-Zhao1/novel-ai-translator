Chapter 1: The Charismatic Leader

Isabella Peterson, with her piercing gaze, spoke in a voice that had turned a bit hoarse, softening the delivery. Even her intense stare wasn't as intimidating due to the change in her demeanor.

"Alright, alright, boss, we're heading there right now!" Amy Green clutched her assistant bag and tagged along behind Isabella. After a few steps, she exclaimed, "Boss, it's quite a ways to the set. Are we really going to walk there?"

Even if they wanted to attract attention, this seemed like a pretty foolish way to do it.

"Ugh," Isabella muttered under her breath, turning around to hop into the RV. She was really losing her cool over this whole Olivia Stewart thing.

Amy quickly ran to start the car, tossing a lemon-flavored gum over to Isabella. "Here, boss, don't forget to chew!"

Catching the gum mid-air, Isabella suddenly recalled Olivia Stewart's obsessive teeth brushing from the night before and tossed the gum out the window with a look of disgust.

The scene at the set was already chaotic. Ever since Sophie Cook yelled, "Sis, you're here!" pandemonium ensued. The security guards were struggling to contain the frenzy, with several already scratched by overzealous fans.

Director Wang was beside himself, pacing and repeatedly calling for reinforcements.

Just as the crowd was about to break through, Tyne's luxurious RV appeared in sight.

"Look, look, it's him! Our Tyne's here!" someone shouted, prompting a mad rush towards the RV. Reporters held up their cameras, snapping away, while fans surrounded the vehicle, crying, laughing, jumping, and dancing.

Tyne's RV was soon engulfed, surrounded by layers of eager journalists and fans. Those on the outside desperately tried to push in closer, almost breaking the glass in their excitement. The RV couldn't move an inch. Microphones were pressed up against the windows, reporters yelling over each other like a boiling pot ready to overflow.

"Tyne, is the kissing video from last night real? Please clarify!"

"Are you dating Olivia Stewart?"

"Is this for a role or is there something else going on?"

Tyne frowned, seeing the endless sea of mouths moving through the windshield and side windows.

Amy Green shrugged helplessly, "Boss, I’m sorry! We can't move the car. Even if I drove over them, their bodies would block the way!"

"Stop being so gross!" Tyne shot Amy a cold glance. "What have you been doing as an assistant all these years? Call Director Wang right now!"

Amy's eyes lit up, quickly dialing the director's number and handing the phone to Tyne with a smile. "You're always the smartest, boss!"

On the other end, Director Wang was frantic. "Tyne, hang in there! Our security can't get close to your car but we're trying! I've already requested backup, and nearby security will be there soon, just hold on!"

Hold on, my foot!

If not for the RV's special design with bulletproof glass, it would have been shattered by now! Luckily, Olivia Stewart wasn't here, or these maniacs would have devoured her!

Isabella coldly ordered, "Aim your usual megaphone at the phone!"

"Got it!" Director Wang complied, although he was unsure why.

Then, Tyne's deep, slightly raspy voice boomed through the set via Director Wang's powerful megaphone, echoing in every corner: "You either get out of my way or stay quiet!"

The crowd instantly froze, as if under a spell. The fans who were yelling and pounding on the windows abruptly fell silent.

Within a minute, the once chaotic set entrance became tranquil.

Tyne's rare public appearances had built him a reputation for being aloof and unapproachable. No one dared defy him. The fans and persistent reporters obediently stepped back, allowing security to organize them into neat lines, two steps away from the RV.

Amy couldn't help but give a thumbs-up, shouting, "Boss, you're incredible!"

As an artist, Tyne's aloofness allowed him to ignore reporters and fans alike. He never engaged in promotional activities, didn't build fan communities, and rarely spoke publicly. When he did, it was usually to tell them to quiet down or leave, yet his fans loved him for it, as obedient as schoolchildren.

Once order was restored, Tyne continued, "Regarding the video of me kissing Olivia Stewart yesterday, let me clarify!"

His words caused an audible gasp among the crowd.

What? A forceful kiss?

No way, why would Tyne, who could have any woman, resort to kissing Olivia Stewart forcibly?

The crowd buzzed with disbelief, especially the die-hard fans, tearfully questioning Tyne's actions.

The reporters quickly recorded Tyne's statement, scribbling notes and rushing to publish the scoop, hoping to make headlines.

Tyne's striking blue eyes scanned the crowd, his deep, slightly hoarse voice carrying a commanding authority: "Yes, I did kiss Miguo. If there's any fault, it's mine. From now on, I don't want to hear any more negative rumors about her!"

Fans wept, and some screamed, "Tyne, I love you more than my life, why would you kiss another woman?"

The reporters, more rational, latched onto the key point: "Why did you kiss Miguo, Tyne? Is it true you don't like women, and was this to clear up the rumors?"

Tyne smirked nonchalantly, "Who I choose to kiss is my private affair, no need to explain it to anyone. However, since you're disrupting our film shoot, I'll say this: Miguo isn't professionally trained, and her scenes needed several retakes yesterday. For the sake of the performance, I had to take drastic measures, which were then leaked online to create a stir."

Oh, so that's how it was!

The fans sighed in relief, while the reporters felt a pang of frustration at losing a juicy story.

Tyne's tone darkened, "This explanation is a one-time deal. I expect you to stop interfering with the filming and leave Olivia Stewart alone! Otherwise, I won't hesitate to make you disappear from this city!"

His words sent the reporters retreating several steps, fully understanding the implications. Anyone not wanting to lose their job better back off!

One eager young reporter, unwilling to let go, asked, "Tyne, don't you want to address your fans who love you dearly? We've heard that several fans were so heartbroken by the video they attempted suicide!"

Tyne glanced coolly at the young reporter, his gaze icy, "Regarding the rumors of fans committing suicide, whether true or not, I have two words for them: dumb move!"

The surrounding fans looked visibly pained.

How could Tyne be so heartless? Was he really as cold and ruthless as the domineering characters he played?

Tyne's blue eyes swept across the tear-streaked faces of his fans, "Lastly, to my fans: the woman I admire is smart, independent, thoughtful, and has her own career and opinions—not someone chasing after me, spreading rumors, gossiping, or threatening to harm themselves."

With that, the fans dispersed like a wave.

Amy couldn't help but give another thumbs-up, "Boss, that was genius! I bet this will inspire a wave of powerful women in the city, boosting our economy thanks to your words!"

Tyne smirked, "I just don't want them bothering Miguo."

And with that, Tyne's impromptu press conference ended. The fans, eager to avoid his disdain, quickly left, and the reporters, with no fresh scoop, reluctantly dispersed.

The set soon returned to normal. Amy drove Tyne's luxurious RV inside, checking the surroundings to make sure no paparazzi were lurking, then cheerfully opened the door for Tyne, bowing playfully, "All clear, boss. You may disembark!"

Tyne shot her a cool glance, remained seated, and picked up his phone to call Olivia, "Where are you? I'll send someone to pick you up."

Miguo's cheerful voice came through, "No need, I'm already on set!"

What? How did she get in here?
