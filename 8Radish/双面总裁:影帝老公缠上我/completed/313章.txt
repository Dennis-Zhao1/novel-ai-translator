The bustling kids' amusement park in Golden City was packed with families enjoying a lively weekend. Parents with children and groups of older kids filled the park with energy and noise. Standing at the entrance, Isabella Peterson frowned, feeling overwhelmed by the crowd and noise.

"There's so many people. It's too noisy! Should we clear the park first?" Isabella suggested, half-jokingly.

Olivia Stewart, holding one of the energetic twins, chuckled, "Kids love the chaos. Clearing the park would take away all the fun!"

So, Isabella had no choice but to instruct the bodyguards to maintain a respectful distance between the crowd and the twins, ensuring their safety.

The group entered the park, each family member drawing attention. The father, handsome and tall, and the mother, sweet and gentle, had two adorable kids who looked like little angels. Even though Isabella and Olivia wore large sunglasses, many people recognized them and shyly approached for pictures.

"This is a place for kids. Let's keep the focus on them," Isabella said politely but with a commanding presence that made the crowd disperse respectfully.

At first, the bodyguards in their black suits intimidated the children, but soon they became part of the fun. Some daring kids even pretended the bodyguards were enemy soldiers in a game, occasionally shooting them with harmless plastic darts.

Coco and Gogo, being quite young, needed help with most activities, so Olivia and Isabella each carried a child to the carousel. Isabella, who hadn't experienced much playtime in her own childhood, found herself feeling unexpectedly joyful on the carousel.

Olivia waved to little Tongtong from a princess carriage, "Tongtong, come let Auntie help you up here! Pick a horse to ride!"

But Tongtong shook his head, wriggled free from the nanny's grip, and dashed off. Olivia assumed he wanted to try something else and told the nanny and bodyguards to follow him.

Coco and Gogo loved the carousel, going round and round, completely enchanted.

Half an hour later, a nanny came rushing over, breathless and panicked, "Miss Olivia, Tongtong is missing!"

"What are you saying?" Olivia exclaimed, nearly falling off the carousel in alarm.

Isabella steadied her, scolding gently, "Calm down. You're still holding Gogo. What if you drop him?"

Olivia apologized, smoothing down Gogo's back, and stepped off the carousel to question the nanny. "When did he disappear? Where was he? Maybe he went to play somewhere else?"

The nanny, on the verge of tears, replied, "At first, I thought the same! He disappeared near the Crystal World section. I searched the area but couldn't find him. The park's huge and crowded. I'm worried about any accidents, so I came to report immediately."

Olivia looked at Isabella, who was already on the phone with David Wright. "Alert everyone. We need to find Tongtong now!"

Olivia thanked her, but Isabella cut her off, "Your responsibility is mine too. No need to thank me."

Everyone's mood shifted from fun to concern as they began the search for Tongtong. With the twins in tow, Olivia and Isabella waited under a sunshade while all the bodyguards, nannies, and even the childcare experts scoured the park for the missing boy.

Another half hour passed without any sign of Tongtong. Isabella decisively ordered, "Clear the park!"

The kids, in the middle of their games, were ushered out, understandably upset. Olivia stood at the exit, apologizing and showing photos, asking if anyone had seen Tongtong. Each group left, shaking their heads, but she remained persistent.

Suddenly, a child exclaimed, "I saw him!"

Olivia's eyes lit up. She quickly approached the child, "Really? When was this?"

The child thought for a moment, "I can't remember exactly when, but I saw him by the trampoline area. There’s a side door there, and he just walked out. I tried to tell him that he’d need a ticket to come back in, but he didn't listen!"

This was a crucial lead! Olivia immediately had people check, and sure enough, the surveillance near the park's side entrance showed Tongtong leaving.

"Wait! Zoom in on this part of the video!" Olivia pointed at a blurred figure in the corner of the screen, her voice trembling, "That's Alexander Peterson!"

Isabella's expression hardened, instructing the team to enhance the footage. Sure enough, after some processing, the image revealed that it was indeed Alexander Peterson.

Isabella's eyes darkened with concern. Despite utilizing all resources to track him down, Alexander had been elusive, even after searching his rumored underground hideouts. Why had he suddenly appeared? Did he take Tongtong? Was he trying to take his own son or use this to leverage Olivia?

"What do we do? Alexander is dangerous and has a history of self-destructive behavior. What if he..." Olivia couldn't finish the thought, her whole body trembling with fear.

"Don't worry!" Isabella reassured, holding Olivia close and whispering, "Even a tiger doesn't harm its cubs. He won't hurt his own son."

"But he doesn't even know Tongtong is his son!" Olivia retorted, her face pale with worry.

Isabella's expression darkened further, but she told Olivia firmly, "He'll be fine. I promise."

With Tongtong out of the park, Isabella's team expanded the search to the surrounding areas, employing a methodical approach. A second team followed potential routes, tracking any clues.

Olivia returned to their home, Water's Edge, with the twins. There was little she could do but wait. Isabella, meanwhile, was busy in the study, analyzing data on her computer. Every few minutes, Olivia would check in, asking, "Any news yet?"

Initially, Isabella tried to reassure her, "Not yet. Get some rest, and I'll update you first thing when we find something." But as time went on, Isabella became more direct, "Olivia, you're only hindering our search efforts."

Olivia knew her anxiety wasn't helping, but she couldn't shake the panic. Even holding the twins didn't soothe her nerves. Desperate for relief, she discreetly took some medication to calm herself.

Once the twins were asleep, Olivia returned to the study, only to find Isabella on the phone, pacing by the window. She quickly wrapped up the call and returned to the computer, scanning traffic cameras.

Olivia's frustration flared up again. "Is this how you search when I'm not watching?"

Surprised by her own outburst, Olivia hesitated. Isabella looked up, her eyes tired and red, "What did you say?"

"Do you care less because Tongtong isn't your child? Would you prefer Alexander takes him away?" Olivia's rational mind wanted her to stop, but her fears were running wild.

"You really think that of me?" Isabella asked, her voice cold and hurt.

"I'm sorry, Isabella, I..." Olivia started, but Isabella cut her off, "Get out!"

Afraid of losing control, Isabella needed space. Olivia left, retreating to her room, feeling alone and lost.

Later that night, Isabella returned to find Olivia asleep on the balcony, curled up like a lonely, lost creature. She gently carried her to bed, tucking her in before heading back to her work.

From past experiences, Isabella knew that Alexander liked to hide in remote, signal-dead areas, making it difficult to track him with technology. Searching manually was like finding a needle in a haystack.

After a sleepless night, Isabella realized there were no further sightings of Alexander or Tongtong on any cameras. It seemed like Alexander had deliberately left a clue at the side door, signaling them.

With no other options, they could only wait. Was Tongtong really with Alexander? And where on earth could they be?
