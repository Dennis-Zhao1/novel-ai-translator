Olivia Stewart lay peacefully in bed, drifting off to dreamland. She always felt a sense of calm with Isabella Peterson by her side.

A few hours later…

"Ugh…" Olivia was jolted awake from a sweet dream by a sudden pain.

After a quick check, the doctor announced, "You're about to have your babies. Are you ready?"

With a gentle smile, Olivia replied, "I've been looking forward to this moment!"

The doctor nodded and gave Olivia an injection to help with the delivery. Soon, the contractions began, each one stronger than the last. But Olivia didn't scream or shout. Instead, she focused, breathing in sync with the doctor's instructions, drawing strength from deep within herself. Her bright eyes shone with determination and resilience, a sight that touched and pained Isabella.

Isabella held Olivia's hand tightly, wiping away the sweat from her forehead, whispering softly, "Olivia, I hate seeing you go through this. Hang in there!"

And then, the sound of a baby's first cry filled the room.

The doctor beamed, "Congratulations, Isabella, it's a boy!"

Isabella leaned down, planting a soft kiss on Olivia's forehead. "You did it, Olivia!"

Minutes later, another cry was heard.

The doctor announced again, "Congratulations, Isabella, it's a girl!"

A perfect set of twins!

"Olivia, you're amazing!" Isabella exclaimed, tears of joy falling as she kissed Olivia again.

Exhausted but overjoyed, Olivia finally allowed herself to drift into a well-deserved sleep.

When she awoke, Olivia saw two little cribs rocking gently nearby. Isabella, under the guidance of the nurse, was learning how to hold the babies. With his large hands, he carefully cradled one of the little ones, looking both serious and awkward at the same time. It was an endearing sight.

Olivia chuckled softly.

"You're awake?" Isabella noticed immediately, handing the baby back to the nurse and rushing to Olivia's side, his eyes full of warmth.

Feeling a bit shy under his gaze, Olivia asked, "Why were you holding just one of them?"

"I had to hold my biggest baby first," Isabella teased, wrapping Olivia in a gentle embrace.

Olivia blushed, "Maybe you should focus on learning how to hold the babies properly."

Isabella, unfazed, raised an eyebrow, "You're always my number one. Don't ever worry about losing your place."

Olivia playfully retorted, "Well, I might just have other favorites now."

Isabella widened his eyes in mock horror, "You wouldn't dare!"

"Jealous of the kids already, Isabella?" Olivia teased.

"Why not? Without my involvement, they wouldn't be here," Isabella shot back with a cheeky grin.

Olivia playfully smacked him, laughing at his antics. The nurse quietly left, closing the door behind her to give them some privacy.

Turning serious, Isabella asked, "So, what shall we name our children?"

Olivia thought for a moment. "You can decide their formal names. For now, let's call our son 'Sunny' and our daughter 'Joy.' What do you think?"

"Sunny… nope, too close to my name!" Isabella joked. "Let's call the son 'Coco' and the daughter 'Joy.' That's settled!"

Olivia pouted, "But won't calling her 'Joy' remind you of me?"

Isabella chuckled, "I treat you like my precious daughter, so it's fitting, don't you think?"

Olivia snuggled into Isabella's embrace, her heart full.

Life with two newborns was hectic yet fulfilling. Despite having a team of nannies and caregivers, Olivia preferred to be hands-on with the twins. The bond between a parent and their children was irreplaceable.

Isabella, like a diligent student, learned how to feed and change diapers from the nurse, much to Olivia's amusement. Teasing him about becoming a full-time dad, Isabella proudly accepted the role, "If you want me to take care of you like this, I'd be happy to!"

Olivia playfully swatted him away but then sighed.

Isabella immediately noticed, "What's wrong? Are you upset?"

Counting her fingers, Olivia said, "We're all here, but what about Tony…"

"The surgery went well, but he needs to rest and recover, so I left him there for now," Isabella explained.

"Why do you seem not to like him very much?" Olivia frowned. "Just because we have the twins, doesn't mean we should ignore Tony. He's been through a lot."

"Okay," Isabella agreed, though internally he was less convinced. Tony, Alexander's son, was a bit of a sore spot for him, especially after Alexander sneaked away while Olivia was in labor.

Isabella had investigated Tony's origins but found no answers. To protect Olivia from any potential distress, he had left it alone, though Tony's presence remained a thorn in his side.

Isabella decided to call and arrange for extended care for Tony, planning to ease Olivia into life without him and eventually find a boarding school for Tony.

As Olivia's recovery period ended, she felt a little sheepish, having stayed in a luxury suite for a month, pampered and cared for.

On discharge day, the Peterson family sent two luxury cars. One for the twins and their caregivers, and another for Olivia and Isabella.

As they drove, Olivia noticed they weren't heading home. "Where are we going, Isabella?" she asked, peering out the window.

Isabella pulled her back into his arms, "Take a nap. You'll find out soon enough."

Olivia wriggled free, pouting, "Sleep? I've done nothing but sleep! Look at me!" She pinched her cheeks, creating a double chin.

Isabella smiled, "I love it."

"Even if I were as big as a pig?" Olivia challenged.

"I'd still love you," Isabella replied, teasingly.

Olivia playfully punched him, "You're the pig!"

Isabella, full of mischief, retorted, "A pig with great strength!"

Rolling her eyes, Olivia turned to look out the window, ignoring him.

Soon, Olivia realized they were driving into the most luxurious part of Golden City, flanked by security.

When they arrived, Olivia was surprised to find themselves at the headquarters of a major film company.

Isabella helped her out of the car. "Are we here to see a movie?" Olivia asked, confused.

With a mysterious smile, Isabella nodded, "Yes."

As they walked inside, Olivia remembered the time Isabella had covered the floor in red roses to apologize and propose. She glanced at the floor—there was a red carpet, but no roses.

A wave of disappointment washed over her. Isabella had proposed several times, but never followed through. Maybe now, with the twins and her postpartum body, he was having second thoughts.

The thought made Olivia uneasy.

As they walked, Olivia caught Isabella glancing to the side. Following his gaze, she saw a slim woman striding by.

So much for loving me no matter what, Olivia thought, her jealousy sparked. She quickened her pace, the sound of her heels echoing in the hall.

Isabella caught up, "Olivia, what's wrong?"

Ignoring him, Olivia marched on.

"Do you need to use the restroom?" Isabella guessed.

Olivia turned, glaring at him, "I feel like hitting someone!"

Wow, motherhood sure changes a woman, Isabella thought, amused yet baffled.

"Who upset my precious girl?" Isabella asked, wrapping an arm around her waist.

But in doing so, he pinched the soft flesh at her waist.

Olivia snapped, "Pinching me? Why don't you pinch her instead?"

"Pinch who?" Isabella asked, genuinely puzzled.

Play dumb, will you? Olivia thought, exasperated.

Sighing, she sped up, Isabella trailing behind, "Explain, please."

Olivia wasn't unreasonable, but she needed to know what she'd done wrong. Why wasn't he proposing again?

"You mean that woman just now?" Olivia asked, her temper flaring.

Realization dawned on Isabella. What was he going to do with her fiery spirit?
