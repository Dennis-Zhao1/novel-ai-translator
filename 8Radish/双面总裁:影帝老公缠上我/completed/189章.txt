Once upon a time, in the whimsical town of Everwood, Isabella Peterson was on top of the world. With her striking presence and a face that could launch a thousand ships, she was the epitome of confidence. "See, I told you Olivia Stewart had something special planned for me!"

Olivia Stewart, on the other hand, was blushing furiously, her lips forming a pout of feigned annoyance. Isabella chuckled, amused by Olivia's reluctance to give her the gift.

But let's be real here, if Isabella hadn't initially acted all aloof and dismissive, Olivia wouldn't have been so flustered, right?

Olivia was still in her protective mode, guarding the little clay figure as if it were a precious treasure. Isabella rolled up her sleeves, ready to jump in.

Olivia's eyes widened, her whole demeanor like a startled cat. "What are you doing? Don't tell me you're planning to snatch it away! Isabella Peterson, I've never seen anyone as shameless as you, trying to snatch a gift!"

"You're so suspicious," Isabella replied, playfully flicking Olivia on the forehead. "I'm waiting for you to finish it and personally hand it over! But since we're making clay figures, let's make a pair. You've given me one, so I'll make one for you!"

Olivia looked like she'd heard the most unbelievable thing. She even dug in her ear, half-expecting she'd misheard. "What did you say? Say that again!"

Ignoring her, Isabella rolled up her sleeves and started digging into the clay.

Wait a minute! Wasn't Isabella known for being a germaphobe? Didn't she mind getting dirty?

Olivia looked at Isabella like she was an alien. But Isabella calmly assessed the size of the clay figure, dug a similarly sized chunk from the clay box, and began kneading it like she was making dough.

Olivia blinked, and then blinked again. Isabella was focused, showing no signs of disgust, molding the clay with serious intent.

Olivia was confused. "Isabella, this is wet clay. You're not grossed out?"

"You enjoy it so much, how could it be dirty?" Isabella replied, not even looking up.

Olivia felt a lump in her throat. He'd even set up this high-end clay studio for her to indulge her hobby, and here he was, playing with clay himself! Isabella, couldn't you stop being so nice?

Olivia's eyes grew misty, but she quickly turned away, blinking hard to push back the tears. Getting teary over something so small was just embarrassing!

"Olivia, should we start with the body or the head?" Isabella's deep voice brought Olivia back. She saw he'd already rolled several evenly sized clay balls.

Olivia had a bad feeling. "What are you planning to make?"

"Why, I'm making you, of course!"

Olivia smacked her forehead. "Isabella, do you even know how to make a clay figure?"

"Nope!" Isabella replied, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, giving Olivia a look like she was the silly one. If I knew how, would I need to ask you?

Olivia was floored. Seriously, you want to make a clay figure of me without knowing how? Do you even realize how hard it is to craft a likeness? I had to apprentice under a master to get this good!

And, honestly, what are you trying to prove by doing something you can't? What if you make me look ridiculous?

Seeing Olivia's upset expression, Isabella shrugged casually. "You can learn anything, right? What can't I learn?"

Alright, Isabella, you're confident! You have skills! But I can't agree!

Olivia watched Isabella's awkward attempts at shaping the clay, feeling a bit exasperated. She didn't want to call the ever-so-talented Isabella clumsy, but come on, those hands were made for typing, not clay!

In less than a minute, Olivia couldn't stand it anymore and rushed over. "Hey, that's not how you do it. Let me teach you!"

Isabella glanced at Olivia, a teasing smile in her eyes.

Together, they worked on the clay. Olivia, who had grown up in a small town and learned clay modeling from a local artist during a tough time in her life, was in her element. But Isabella, born with a silver spoon, dressed in a designer shirt worth thousands, was here making clay figures with her!

Olivia stole a glance at Isabella. His focus, the childlike stubbornness, and his disregard for the mud on his shirt sleeves made her heart warm.

She reached over, rolling his sleeves up a bit more, then guided him through the steps.

"Let's start with the body, making sure the proportions are right. Keep the clothes simple, like my pink dress. It's simple but elegant!"

"Now let's carefully work on the head. Hair in a ponytail is tricky, so let's keep it loose and flowing. You can use this tool to create the texture. I usually just use a toothpick, but since you have all these fancy tools, let's use this gold needle!"

As Isabella followed Olivia's instructions, he listened to her sweet voice, which had a soothing melody to it. He realized that this calm life wasn't so bad. Compared to the cutthroat business world and endless hours of coding, his life before meeting Olivia felt like a waste.

Isabella's momentary distraction caused him to apply too much pressure, prompting Olivia to exclaim, "Hey, be gentle! Look, you made the nose crooked! That's it, just like that. Make it smaller, with a delicate bridge. Does my nose look that bad to you?"

Isabella looked at Olivia, a tender smile on his lips. He lightly swiped her nose with his clay-covered finger. "My version of the nose isn't pretty, huh?"

Olivia stared at the muddy finger, knowing that if she said the wrong thing, it'd end up smeared on her face. She sighed and said, "It's beautiful, way better than the original!"

Satisfied, Isabella returned to sculpting, muttering confidently, "I told you, there's nothing I can't learn."

Olivia rolled her eyes, watching his attempt at a clay figure. Seriously, is your taste influenced by aliens?

She didn't dare voice her thoughts, fearing Isabella might make her look even worse. Knowing him, he'd insist on having it crafted by a master artisan and displayed prominently!

Better keep guiding him.

Now it was time to shape the mouth. A task that required finesse.

Isabella's attempts resulted in lips that were either too big or too thick, resembling sausages.

Olivia was getting anxious. "Let me help you!"

Isabella waved her off. "I got this. Just watch!"

Olivia was internally crying. I'm watching because I can't stand it anymore! It's already awful, and now with those lips... oh my god! How can I show my face?

Not giving up, Olivia suggested, "Uh, how about I help with the jawline, and you use a carving tool for the lips? It's much easier than molding by hand."

Isabella paused, nodded, "Makes sense!"

Olivia thought she'd convinced him, her heart skipping a beat. But when she reached out, Isabella pushed her hand away, looking for a carving tool.

"I've got the basic shape down. No need for help! And when it comes to carving, I'm quite skilled. I'll make your features perfect!"

Isabella confidently grabbed a carving tool, ready to start.

Olivia practically wanted to kneel before him.

You're using such a big tool; one stroke could wipe out half the face. What precision are you talking about?

Hastily, Olivia handed him the smallest tool. "Isabella, use this! My mouth is small, no need for such a big tool!" Otherwise, one swipe and I'll look like a clown!

"Oh." Isabella took the smaller tool and tried to figure out how to start.

Olivia wanted to help, but he was determined to finish it himself, so she could only watch anxiously.

Isabella hesitated, trying to find the right angle, then tossed the tool aside. "I need to study your lips first!"

And so, in the quaint town of Everwood, amidst laughter, bickering, and clay-smudged sleeves, Isabella and Olivia continued their playful art session, crafting not just clay figures, but memories to last a lifetime.
