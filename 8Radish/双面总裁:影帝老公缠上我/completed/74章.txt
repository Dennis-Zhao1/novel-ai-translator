In the posh VIP room upstairs, Isabella Peterson lounged comfortably in a swivel chair, her oversized sunglasses perched on her nose as she flipped through a stack of profiles from yesterday's auditions. When she reached Sophie Cook's file, she lingered on the photo for a moment.

Sophie was indeed quite similar to Bai Yike—equally young and attractive, with a charming innocence. But on closer inspection, it was easy to tell them apart. Bai Yike's gaze was pure and clear, while Sophie, despite her youth, had a hint of worldliness in her eyes.

"Sophie Cook," Isabella murmured, reading the name from the file. Sophie Cook, Olivia Stewart's sister, huh? The infamous sister of that troublemaker Olivia?

"Sophie Cook, 18, freshman at Golden City Film Academy," Isabella read aloud. A freshman with such looks—she could definitely make it big in the entertainment industry. But her rise to fame would likely be a rocky one, Isabella thought with a hint of derision, her lips curling slightly.

Director Wang, standing nearby, watched for any sign of approval on Isabella's face as she studied Sophie's profile. But he couldn't discern whether Isabella was impressed or not.

Yesterday's initial auditions were mostly about appearances—whether the actors looked good on camera, their basic backgrounds, and any previous acting experience. Today's second round was all about skills: a talent showcase to see if the contestants had the versatility and potential for acting.

The contestants who made it this far were pulling out all the stops—music, dance, comedy skits, and more. Sophie Cook performed a solo dance. Her graceful moves and striking beauty initially captivated everyone. But when the routine called for more challenging techniques, a hangover from the night before caused her to stumble and fall.

A few more mistakes followed, leaving the audience surprised and disappointed. Normally, such a performance would mean elimination, but Director Wang hesitated, unsure of Isabella's intentions, and decided to keep Sophie in the running, albeit in the last spot.

After much deliberation, the production team narrowed it down to ten finalists. Each contestant drew a scene from a new script for the final audition, scheduled to happen in three days.

As the finalists left, excitedly discussing their drawn scenes, Sophie lingered behind, clutching her slip of paper, her face clouded with frustration.

Outside, Olivia Stewart had been anxiously watching. When Sophie fell during her dance, Olivia had been so worried she almost rushed in to help. But when Sophie made it through, even at the last place, Olivia was relieved. She knew Sophie didn't want to see her right now, but after that fall, she had to check on her.

Sophie trudged out, her mood souring even more when she saw Olivia's bright smile.

"Sophie, congratulations! Are you okay? Let me see!" Olivia reached out, concerned.

"What are you looking at?" Sophie snapped, pulling away. Her voice was sharp, devoid of its usual sweetness. "Olivia, are you just here to laugh at me?"

Olivia frowned. "How am I laughing at you? You fell during your dance, I'm just worried about you. I'm here because I care, understand?"

"Spare me your fake concern!" Sophie retorted. "I messed up, and you're grinning like a fool. If that's not you enjoying my failure, then what is?" She walked off, head held high.

"Sophie, it was just a small slip-up. You're still in the finals! I'm genuinely happy for you," Olivia insisted, following her.

"Happy, my foot! I'm the last one, on hold!" Sophie scoffed.

"So what if you're last or on hold? Being in the finals means another chance, a chance to fight for it!" Olivia urged.

Sophie rolled her eyes. "I don't have your optimism! When have I ever been last in anything? It's a joke, an insult!"

"Sophie, nobody has it easy all the time! I don't want you to give up because of one setback. Prepare well, the finals in three days are what really matter!" Olivia tried to encourage her.

"Enough! I don't need your lectures!" Sophie was irritated, waving her off.

"I'm your sister!" Olivia said firmly.

"I don't have a sister like you!" Sophie shouted back.

Olivia froze, her face turning pale. Sophie's words seemed to hang in the air, pressing down on both of them.

After a tense silence, Olivia spoke, her voice distant and ethereal, "Sophie, you're eighteen now, not a child. Mom and Dad are gone, and in this world, we're the only family each other has left. So I do my best to take care of you, spoil you, accommodate you, but it doesn't mean my heart doesn't hurt."

"…"

"I guess these years of relying on each other have spoiled you. You're eighteen, an adult now, and it's time to be independent. Don't worry, whether you acknowledge me as your sister or not, I'll follow Mom's wishes and take care of you, at least until you graduate. I'll transfer your living expenses to your account each month, manage it well, and be frugal."

With that, Olivia turned to leave.

"Olivia!" Sophie rushed forward, grabbing her. Tears streaked her face. "I'm sorry!"

Sophie hugged Olivia tightly, crying harder than ever, like a child. "I was just speaking without thinking, I really know I was wrong. Please forgive me! Without you, I have no one left in this world!"

Those words hit Olivia deeply, and she softened instantly. Sophie tightened her grip, crying even more, "Olivia, I didn't mean it, I just felt bad about the audition. You have to forgive me!"

Olivia gently patted Sophie's back, sighing helplessly, "Alright, stop crying, you're always like a child."

"I won't stop until you forgive me," Sophie insisted, sobbing.

"I forgive you. Just don't say hurtful things like that again."

"Okay."

Sophie sniffled, wiping her tears, which had come and gone quickly.

"Alright, alright!" Olivia comforted her, wiping away the last of her tears. "Go get some rest, prepare for the next few days, and do your best in the finals!"

"Olivia…" Sophie hesitated.

Olivia silently pulled out some cash, handing it to Sophie. Sophie had been asking for money a lot lately, and Olivia, unable to provide, had taken some from the card Isabella had given her, planning to save up and return it later.

"Thanks, Olivia!" Sophie beamed instantly, her tears forgotten.

"These days you're applying for jobs, spending a bit more is understandable, but in the future, be frugal. Otherwise, I really can't help. This money is temporarily borrowed from a friend," Olivia explained.

Sophie's mind flashed to the scene she witnessed yesterday, a cold smile passing through her eyes. Pretending to borrow money while clearly being supported by someone rich, Olivia, you're quite the actress!

"Okay, Olivia, I know!" Sophie replied, her face innocent and sweet again, the previous tension gone.

Sophie affectionately took Olivia's hand, swinging her arm. "Olivia…"

She was so clingy, as if the earlier harsh words had never been spoken.

Olivia raised an eyebrow slightly. "Is it not enough?"

"Oh, Olivia, who ever thinks money is enough? It's not like I only come to you for money!" Sophie said playfully.

Olivia chuckled inwardly—wasn't that exactly it?

Sophie, watching Olivia's face, cautiously asked, "Olivia, your friend seems pretty influential, right?"

"Uh…kind of," Olivia replied. The son of a real estate mogul, just mentioning the Peterson Group could send shivers down people's spines. But Isabella was low-key, and Olivia never flaunted his name around. Besides, relationships were personal, and she saw no need to boast about it.

Sophie noticed Olivia's reluctance to discuss further and bit her lip. "Olivia, why don't you introduce me? Just to meet him?"

Olivia frowned, puzzled. "Sophie, didn't you always insist I never mention you to outsiders?"

Dummy, your usual crowd of party friends is different from this.

Sophie felt a pang of frustration, but kept her expression sweet and innocent. "Olivia, it's not like… I could meet him and see if he's good enough for you?"

Olivia blushed slightly, looking away. "He's really busy right now, maybe another time."

"Olivia, just a little introduction, why are you so secretive? Afraid I'll steal your boyfriend?" Sophie teased.

Olivia's face flushed again, but she didn't respond directly, leaving the question hanging in the air.
