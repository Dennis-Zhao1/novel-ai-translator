Olivia Stewart was in tears. "Who... who said I stole someone's man?"

After Ethan King had a go at her, Olivia was left feeling all sorts of tangled up inside. As she defended herself, she instinctively reached to tug on Ethan's ear, only to notice her bare wrist.

"Oh no! My bracelet!"

Ethan immediately looked concerned. "Think back—did you wear it out today, or maybe you left it at home?"

Olivia shook her head. "I never take it off."

"Then let's retrace our steps and find it!"

Ethan was already on the floor, peering under every piece of furniture. He knew how much that string of wooden beads meant to Olivia—it was the only thing her mom had left her, and she treasured it more than anything.

At that moment, Olivia couldn't care less about being caught by Group Peterson's security. She retraced her steps, even searching the restroom where she'd changed earlier. But there was no sign of the bracelet.

Feeling defeated, Olivia leaned against the wall, exhausted and anxious.

Ethan returned, panting heavily. "I checked the main hall. Group Peterson's folks are long gone. I searched everywhere, but no luck. Olivia, don't worry! Maybe I can buy you another one?"

Olivia shook her head. "Forget it, let's go." Sure, she might find another wooden bracelet, but it would never be the one her mom gave her.

As she shuffled out, Olivia suddenly realized she was back in the corridor where she'd borrowed a kiss from Ethan. Seeing the empty wall in front of her, a flood of memories washed over her, causing her cheeks to flush.

What was she doing, daydreaming at a time like this?

She scolded herself for getting distracted, trying to shake off the embarrassing memories. But then a thought struck her—could it have been him?

They'd searched everywhere, and the bracelet was gone. It seemed like the only remaining possibility.

Olivia tried to recall the moment, wondering if Isabella Peterson had brushed against her wrist. But she couldn't remember. Still, given his reputation for taking advantage, it wouldn't be surprising if he snatched it while she was distracted.

Seriously, how could he do that?

Ethan had already started checking the hallway for cameras at Olivia's request, but there were none. A place like this hotel valued guest privacy too much for surveillance.

With their last hope gone, Olivia covered her face and slowly sank to the floor, tears streaming silently through her fingers. She rarely cried, but this bracelet was the only link to her mom. How could she not be heartbroken? Even if Isabella had taken it, she had no proof. And with Group Peterson looking for her, she couldn't just march in and demand it back.

"It's all my fault. I shouldn't have let you come here. Olivia, please, don't cry. You can pinch my ear or slap my face, just don't cry!" Ethan pleaded, circling Olivia in a helpless panic.

Olivia buried her head in her knees, tears flowing like an open faucet, each sob louder than the last. Today had been a disaster. Her ex had married her best friend, she crashed the wedding by accident, escaped a kiss that almost turned into more, and lost her mom's only keepsake. If she'd known it would cost her the bracelet, she'd have let Group Peterson catch her, even if it meant facing the truth about the fake pregnancy.

Olivia wasn't one to wallow in self-pity, but sometimes emotions just overflowed like water breaking through a dam.

"Olivia, can we stop crying?"

"Woo woo..."

"Olivia, people are staring. They'll think I did something to you. Can we save face, please?"

"Waah..."

"How about we go home and cry there?"

Ethan finally managed to drag Olivia out of the hotel and back to their apartment. He tried everything to cheer her up but eventually resorted to their last-ditch plan: a night out at their favorite barbecue joint to drown their sorrows.

Meanwhile, Isabella Peterson stood on the balcony of a high-rise, sipping wine and fingering the very bracelet Olivia had lost, reminiscing about a night as beautiful as a dream.

In the lavish apartment, Isabella's phone buzzed incessantly with missed calls—395 in total—from his mother, who was desperately trying to track down the pregnant woman she believed was carrying her grandchild.

Isabella finally answered. "Mom, I haven't found her."

"How could you not find her? You must not have looked hard enough. She's carrying your child! Once she gives birth, we can send her away. Then you can have any woman you want."

Isabella smirked, knowing his mother's true intentions.

"Mom, don't you think she might be a fraud? If I can have any woman, why worry about an heir?"

"You don't get it! If you won't look, I will!"

His mother's uncharacteristic outburst ended the call abruptly. Isabella shook his head, wondering what chaos his mother would cause in the city. At least it kept her busy, sparing him the constant pressure to marry and have kids.

Just then, a call came in from the family butler. "Second Young Master, the Old Master requests your presence immediately."

"Tell him I'm busy. Inform the Bai family that today's engagement is valid. Tell Bai Miaomiao to polish up at a finishing school before marrying into our family."

"Yes, Second Young Master."

After hanging up, Isabella pondered over the arranged marriage. The Bai family, though wealthy, were nowhere near the Petersons' level. It seemed like a strategic alliance, but Isabella suspected ulterior motives.

Could his grandfather have been compromised by the Bai family?

He swirled his wine thoughtfully. If his mother hadn't pushed so hard, he wouldn't have agreed. But now, with her focus on the supposed pregnant woman, he had some breathing room.

The fax machine whirred, and Isabella glanced at the paper: "Olivia Stewart..."

Why wasn't it Bai Yike?

Disappointed, he scanned the information. Olivia Stewart, 23, a struggling artist who sang on street corners and molded clay figurines to make ends meet. If she were Bai Yike, she wouldn't be living like this.

And then there was the mention of her male best friend, Ethan King—a model with an ambiguous orientation.

Isabella's eyes narrowed. Male friends were never just friends, in his experience.

He downed his wine, set the glass down with a thud, and made a call. "Michael Wright, I need everything on her, especially from five years ago. What was she called then, and what was she doing?"
