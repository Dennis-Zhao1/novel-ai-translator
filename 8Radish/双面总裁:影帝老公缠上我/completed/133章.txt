"Don't! Stay away! Get away from me!" Sophie Cook screamed, crouching on the floor surrounded by shattered glass. Blood seeped through the white fabric of her dress, leaving crimson stains that stood out starkly.

"Sophie, calm down!" Olivia Stewart rushed over, her heart racing with concern.

The house staff looked at Olivia as if she were their savior, stepping back respectfully. "Oh, thank goodness you're here, Olivia. Please, talk to Sophie. She's trying to hurt herself!"

Self-harm. The words sent a chill through Olivia's body, her voice trembling as she spoke, "Sophie, please, don't scare me like this! I'm here for you, okay? Your sister's here."

Olivia approached cautiously, her voice soothing, and when she was close enough, she wrapped her arms around Sophie. "Don't cry, Sophie. I'm here."

"Olivia—" Sophie wailed, clinging to her sister's back, the glass shards in her hand piercing Olivia's skin.

The sharp pain was intense, but Olivia held on, comforting Sophie with gentle pats on her back. This was what Sophie needed when she was spiraling—reassurance.

Slowly, Sophie began to calm down.

"Okay, Sophie, let's get away from all this glass. It's dangerous here. Let's sit somewhere safe." Olivia coaxed Sophie to stand, guiding her away from the debris.

Sophie followed obediently, but when she noticed the blood on her hands, she screamed, "Blood!"

That's when everyone realized Olivia's back was injured, the blood soaking through her clothes, a shard still embedded in her skin.

"Olivia, your back!" someone cried out.

Sophie looked horrified, shaking her head and waving her hands as if to dismiss the truth. "No, I didn't mean to! I didn't want to hurt you! I was trying to cut myself. Where's my glass shard?"

Panicked, she began searching the floor.

Olivia quickly grabbed her hands, gesturing for the staff to leave. "Don't look for it, Sophie. Let's talk about what happened, okay?"

Olivia wiped the tears from Sophie's cheeks, but as she touched her face, Sophie jerked away. "Don't touch me! Don't look at me! I'm hideous!"

Olivia realized then that Sophie had seen the scars on her face.

Sophie had always adored her looks. The thought of scars was unbearable. Olivia had rushed over after hearing from the doctor that Sophie's scars might be permanent. She hadn't expected Sophie to find out so soon.

"Sophie, it's okay. I talked to the doctor. Drinking milk will help your skin. You'll heal soon, I promise."

"Really?" Sophie grabbed the milk, chugging it down in one go.

"Olivia, I drank—"

Before she could finish, Sophie slumped into the chair, the milk cup slipping from her fingers.

Olivia sighed, brushing Sophie's hair back gently. "I'm sorry, Sophie. Sleep for now. I'll find a way to help you."

Sophie slept soundly, unaware that the milk had been laced with a sleeping pill by Olivia. She hoped this rest would give the doctor time to examine Sophie thoroughly.

Olivia's grip tightened on the glass, her heart heavy with guilt and pain. She stepped outside, facing the staff with a steely gaze. "Who gave her the mirror?"

"It wasn't me!"

"Not me!"

They all shook their heads.

Olivia glared at them. "Isabella isn't here, and you think you can slack off? Am I too lenient? Do I seem like I have no authority?"

"Bang!"

A maid suddenly fell to her knees, sobbing. "I'm sorry, Olivia. I didn't give her the mirror. She found it herself."

Olivia sighed deeply. Sophie would find out eventually. Hiding mirrors was only a temporary fix.

She hadn't expected Sophie's reaction to be so extreme, smashing the mirror and attempting self-harm.

It wasn't just for herself—it was to defend Olivia.

The thought made Olivia's chest ache, the guilt overwhelming. Her own pain was nothing compared to this.

After a long pause, Olivia gestured for the maid to stand. "Get up."

"Thank you, Olivia!"

The staff dispersed, leaving Olivia alone with her thoughts, her eyes welling with tears.

"Olivia, your back..."

Lucas Wright had arrived, his eyes widening at the sight of her injuries. He quickly called for the doctor. "Olivia needs help now!"

"It's fine," Olivia managed a smile, though the pain was numbing.

"The doctor will see Sophie first. She's asleep. Check on her thoroughly, okay?"

The doctor hesitated, glancing at Olivia. "With all due respect, Sophie's scars won't heal overnight. Your injury is more urgent."

"Yes, Olivia," Lucas added. "You need to be well to care for Sophie. If you fall ill, who will help her?"

"Alright," Olivia sighed, sitting down as the doctor prepared to treat her.

The doctor worked quickly, cleaning the wound and removing the shard. Olivia bit her lip to suppress a cry, the pain searing.

She didn't make a sound, enduring it all silently.

The doctor admired her resilience. Despite her delicate appearance, Olivia was strong and determined, qualities that clearly captivated those around her.

Once finished, the doctor sighed in relief. "Good thing the shard was left in place."

"What do you mean?" Olivia and Lucas asked.

"It pierced an artery. Removing it immediately would've caused severe blood loss. Olivia, you acted wisely."

Olivia chuckled wryly. "I didn't think about it. I just wanted to calm Sophie."

"Good deeds are rewarded," Lucas mused. "How is Olivia's condition?"

"Not too serious. She'll recover in about a week."

Eager to change the subject, Olivia urged, "Now check on my sister. This is your chance to examine her scars while she's asleep."

"Right away."

The doctor entered Sophie's room, and Olivia insisted on staying, despite Lucas's protests for her to rest.

After a thorough examination, the doctor nodded at Olivia, motioning for her to step outside.
