**Lucas's Dilemma**

Lucas wiped the sweat off his brow, nervously facing Isabella. "You've brought Tommy back, sir. Maybe it's time to consider what Mrs. Peterson wants..."

Isabella scoffed lightly, "If it were you, could you tolerate it?"

Lucas immediately bowed his head, falling silent. Yeah, any man would find it tough to accept his partner having another man's child, especially raising that child right under his nose as if he were his own!

Isabella didn't want to believe there was anything between Olivia and Alexander back then. After all, the investigation and James's words both confirmed that Alexander detested the child. But the result was undeniable: Tommy was Alexander's son!

Despite investigating for so long, Isabella found no evidence of Alexander having any other relationships. The only one was with Olivia. Back then, Olivia had been so traumatized she forgot about the whole affair!

Isabella couldn't bring himself to delve into the past. He didn't believe there was anything left between Olivia and Alexander. Yet Olivia's fierce protection of Tommy was like a thorn that just kept digging deeper into his heart.

Remembering Olivia's kidnapping by Alexander, who, despite his cruelty, didn't harm her at all, Isabella's gaze turned icy. "Do my twins mean less to her than Alexander's sick child?"

His voice was low, filled with a mix of melancholy, self-mockery, and... was it hurt?

Lucas listened silently to Isabella's soliloquy, wanting to comfort him but at a loss for words. The master was someone who couldn't tolerate any deception, and for Mrs. Peterson, he even accepted another man's child. This pain...

Mrs. Peterson kept unknowingly adding salt to Isabella's wound, unaware of the true story!

"Sir!" Lucas suddenly brightened, "Mrs. Peterson cares for Tommy because, in her heart, he's your child! Not someone else's!"

Isabella's lips curled into a sarcastic smile. "Aren't the twins mine too? Yet these days, in her stubbornness, she ignores them. But when she hears Tommy is back, she's overjoyed, even eating more than usual!"

Standing in the hallway, Isabella coldly watched Olivia's silhouette in the dining room, his mocking smile tinged with a sense of heartache.

Lucas had nothing more to say. Not having married, he never really understood women. If the master couldn't handle it, what hope was there for him?

Lucas furrowed his brows helplessly, peeking into the dining room below. "Sir, it looks like Mrs. Peterson is nearly done eating. Aren't you going down?" It's a perfect chance to make peace!

Isabella's eyes turned cold. "Why should I? Just to tag along and pick up the kid?"

"You've already brought him back, might as well go all the way," Lucas urged.

"I'm busy this afternoon!" Isabella threw back icily, quickly retreating to his room, slamming the door shut.

Lucas shook his head, heading down to relay the message. "Mrs. Peterson, the master has urgent files to handle and won't be able to personally pick up Tommy. He asked me to accompany you."

Olivia sighed, knowing it was just an excuse. Hopefully, once Tommy was back and spent some time here, Isabella would grow to like the poor child.

Checking on the twins in the nursery, Olivia found them sleeping soundly. She kissed their soft cheeks. "Your big brother is coming home! You'll have another family member to love you!"

Heading out, Lucas stood respectfully at the door. "Mrs. Peterson, the car is ready."

Olivia smiled, "Lucas, thank you for all your hard work with the house. Don't always bow when you see me; you're not young anymore. Take care of your back!"

"Thank you for your concern, ma'am, but I wouldn't dare disregard propriety," Lucas replied, his habit ingrained deeply.

Seeing his dedication, Olivia didn't argue further. "Just send a couple of people with me to pick up Tommy. There's plenty to do here. No need for you to come along. Have someone prepare Tommy's room next to the twins."

Lucas nodded, "Yes, Mrs. Peterson!"

At the door, Olivia hesitated, wanting Lucas to remind Isabella to eat lunch, but decided against it. Lucas, being so diligent, would surely take care of it, right?

Calling it work was just an excuse! Isabella was being difficult, avoiding lunch with her.

Silently cursing Isabella for being a stubborn fool, Olivia got into the car. If it were any other issue, she might try to comfort Isabella. But when it came to the child, she couldn't budge an inch. It was a parental duty!

At the airport, Olivia quickly found Tommy. He'd grown taller and sturdier in the past six months, his cheeks rosy and his demeanor lively. Isabella's people must have taken good care of him!

Maybe she had been too harsh on Isabella. A pang of guilt mixed with her joy at seeing Tommy.

She spread her arms wide, smiling warmly, "Tommy!"

A bit shy, Tommy ran into her embrace, calling softly, "Aunt Olivia!"

Struggling a bit to lift him, Olivia laughed, "Wow, you've gotten heavier!"

Tommy squirmed to get down. "Aunt Olivia, let me walk. I'm grown up now. I don't want you to get tired!"

Such a sweet, thoughtful child!

Olivia set him down, ruffling his hair. "Tommy, I've had babies now. Would you call me Auntie Olivia instead?"

Tommy tilted his head, considering it, then nodded, "Okay!"

Olivia smiled with relief. Clarifying the relationship now would make it easier to transition to calling her mom later. If she suddenly became 'Mom,' Tommy might find it hard to accept!

Holding Tommy's hand, Olivia chatted happily, "Tommy, you have siblings now! When we get home, you'll see how cute they are!"

Tommy tilted his head, "Am I not going back to the orphanage?"

Olivia tapped his forehead, "No more orphanage. We're going home! You'll be with Auntie Olivia and her family from now on, okay?"

"Okay!" Tommy agreed cheerfully, his round face beaming, eyes sparkling with hope.

Olivia felt a weight lift from her heart. Surely, Isabella would come to love this charming boy!

As their car crossed the bridge to their home, Tommy's eyes widened. "Are we moving into a fairytale castle?"

Olivia chuckled, ruffling his hair, "Yes, a fairytale kingdom just for us, built by your... uh, by their dad."

"Dad?" Tommy asked, puzzled.

Realizing her slip, Olivia quickly corrected, "I mean, your siblings' dad."

Tommy looked up, "Should I call him uncle then?"

Olivia thought for a moment. "Let's start with uncle, okay?"

Better to wait until things were settled with Isabella before revealing more, to avoid unnecessary complications.

Tommy was entranced by the various castles, eyes wide and glued to the window.

Olivia studied Tommy. He resembled Isabella only slightly, with softer features, more akin to Alexander's. No, that couldn't be!

The thought startled Olivia. Tommy was still young, his features not fully developed. Naturally, he didn't have Isabella's strong contours.

Plus, Isabella and Alexander were brothers. Some resemblance was inevitable.

Olivia tried to reassure herself, but an uneasy feeling lingered. That tightness in her chest returned.

Leaning back, she took deep breaths.

Tommy turned to her. "Auntie Olivia, are you okay?"

She lifted her eyelids, "I'm fine, just a bit tired. A little rest is all I need."

Tommy crawled over, placing his small hands on her forehead. "Auntie, let me help! I used to do this for the headmistress when she had headaches. It feels nice, right?"

His innocent gesture eased Olivia's anxiety, a smile slowly forming on her lips.

Tommy had been shy and withdrawn, almost reclusive. Seeing him so lively now, interacting easily, was heartwarming.

Clearly, the time away had been beneficial for Tommy, both physically and mentally.

She had wrongly blamed Isabella for not caring, for not loving Tommy, thinking he didn't miss him at all. But in truth, Isabella had ensured Tommy was well cared for.

In every way.
