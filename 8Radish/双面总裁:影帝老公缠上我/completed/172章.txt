"Isabella, we need to break up."

With a regal grace that commanded attention, Isabella Peterson turned away, leaving Daniel Johnson trembling in her wake. He quickly buried his head, prostrating himself on the ground as if playing dead, not daring to move an inch.

A minute later, Isabella and her entourage had vanished completely, leaving the desolate outskirts as silent as a grave.

After what seemed like an eternity, Daniel finally remembered to call out, "Help! Somebody help—" But his voice was nothing more than a rasp, his throat too raw to produce any sound.

Driven by sheer survival instinct, Daniel began to crawl, even though his legs were broken. His whole body writhed through the jagged rocks like some pitiful worm, leaving a horrifying trail of blood behind.

It was a bitter lesson in the saying, "You reap what you sow." Daniel had brought this upon himself. A man who betrayed his own woman deserved nothing less than to crawl in the dirt, his life reduced to a miserable existence.

Meanwhile, on the rural highway, Isabella Peterson drove like a bat out of hell. Even though the road was littered with gravel, she accelerated as if on an open highway, making her bodyguards' hearts race as they struggled to keep up.

At that moment, Isabella wished she could sprout wings and fly straight back to Olivia Stewart. Seeing Olivia's tear-streaked face as she ran out of the café had torn a piece of Isabella's heart. She wanted nothing more than to rush to Olivia, to hold her, to tell her she didn't care about the past and that Olivia had always been the exception to her usual guardedness.

But Isabella didn't chase after Olivia. She restrained herself, knowing that Olivia was in a vulnerable state and wouldn't want anyone to witness her humiliation. Any attempt to console her would be futile, only driving Olivia further away.

Instead, Isabella instructed her people to keep a close eye on Olivia as she set out to deal with Daniel Johnson. She needed to unravel the events of that fateful night to give Olivia some closure.

Never in her wildest dreams did Isabella expect that the culprit would turn out to be herself.

Reflecting on that night at the lavish club, Isabella remembered how she had always prided herself on her self-control, never succumbing to temptation. Yet that night was the only exception, a vivid memory burned into her mind.

She had been slightly drunk, thanks to a few insistent producers, and had gone to their prepared room to rest. Little did she know, they had the audacity to set her up.

When Olivia was brought to the room, Isabella was still somewhat aware, driven by an instinctive aversion to throw out the woman who had just been shoved into her lap. But clearly, Olivia had also had too much to drink and collapsed into Isabella's arms.

In the dim light from the doorway, Isabella saw a face that was delicate and flawless like porcelain, with gentle features, long lashes, a petite nose, and rosy lips.

"White Eko!" Isabella's heart skipped a beat.

The woman she had been searching for all these years, the one who had abandoned her in a life-or-death moment, was right there. Isabella had often fantasized about how she would make White Eko pay if she ever found her, but with the real, warm person in her arms, all she wanted to do was cherish her.

Gently shaking the half-conscious Olivia, Isabella asked, "White Eko, what are you doing here?"

"Ugh, you're so annoying!" Olivia swatted at Isabella's face, losing her balance and falling onto Isabella instead.

Caught off guard, Isabella ended up on the carpet with Olivia on top of her. As their lips met, a surge of pent-up emotions overwhelmed her, and all reason collapsed...

It was a night filled with romance and passion.

Isabella released years of pent-up longing for White Eko.

"White Eko, White Eko!" Isabella murmured as dawn broke, reaching out to find the space beside her empty.

Had it all been just a dream?

Shaking her groggy head, Isabella glanced around the room. It was empty, yet the soreness in her body and the lingering scent in the air confirmed that the night had been real.

"White Eko! Where are you? White Eko?"

In her panic, Isabella rushed out, grabbing her subordinate by the collar. "Where is the girl from last night?"

"Uh," the subordinate stammered, visibly anxious. "The girl snuck out in the middle of the night but caught her boyfriend... er, with her best friend. They fought and left together."

"What boyfriend?" Isabella tightened her grip. "White Eko doesn't have a boyfriend. I'm her boyfriend!"

"I-I don't know the girl's name," the subordinate stammered, on the verge of tears. "But she was the gift from the producers last night!"

"What did you say? Repeat that!"

"I swear I'm telling the truth!" the subordinate insisted, trembling. "Her boyfriend got her drunk and sent her over!"

So it was just a girl who looked like White Eko. But Isabella had still crossed a line, betraying White Eko with this stranger.

Releasing the subordinate's collar, Isabella closed her eyes in anguish. "Get out!"

From that day on, Isabella refused all invitations to clubs or parties, tormented by the memory of that night.

Little did she know, the girl from that night was Olivia Stewart, her White Eko.

A joyful realization spread through Isabella's heart like fireworks. They had never truly been apart!

"Olivia, I'm back!"

Thinking of Olivia, who had returned home hurt, Isabella floored the gas pedal. Her car tore through the suburban streets, racing towards the mansion.

Before the car even came to a stop, Isabella leaped out, tossing the keys to a nearby bodyguard and sprinting into the castle.

The bodyguards exchanged bewildered glances, having never seen their normally composed master so frantic.

"Olivia! Olivia!" Isabella's voice echoed through the halls even before she entered.

Lucas Wright hurried over, placing Isabella's slippers at her feet. "Miss Olivia is upstairs. She's locked herself in her room since she got back and hasn't come out."

Kicking off her shoes, Isabella hastily slipped on the slippers and dashed upstairs.

Lucas watched, his white eyebrows knitting together in concern. This reckless person was so unlike the calm and collected man he knew. What had happened to make him so agitated?

Taking the stairs two at a time, Isabella reached her room and pushed against the door, only to find it locked from the inside.

Smiling softly, she knocked gently. "Olivia, open the door."

Inside, Olivia was wallowing in her emotions, but hearing Isabella's voice made her heart skip a beat.

Isabella was here!

What should she do?

"Uh, just a minute!"

Olivia hastily wiped her tears, stood up, and began to fret like a rabbit caught in headlights.

Then she spotted the photo she'd taken from Daniel and quickly hid it in a drawer. Rushing to the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, hoping the color would return to her cheeks before she opened the door.

Impatiently, Isabella was about to knock again when the door swung open, revealing Olivia's pale face.

Seeing the weariness in Olivia's eyes, Isabella was filled with a profound tenderness. This girl must have cried her heart out.

Even though she had tried to hide it, the redness and swelling in her eyes were unmistakable.

Gently, Isabella pulled Olivia into a comforting embrace.

But as soon as Olivia touched Isabella's chest, she recoiled like a startled rabbit, retreating several steps.

Frowning, Isabella asked, "Olivia?"

"Don't come any closer!" Olivia pleaded, waving her hands. "Please, don't touch me!"

Isabella's brows furrowed in concern. She hadn't immediately comforted Olivia to avoid making her feel worse, but she hadn't expected Olivia to react like this.

"Olivia, it's okay, it's all in the past. Come here," Isabella coaxed, softening her voice.

"No, no, I don't want to!" Olivia shook her head vehemently. "Don't touch me, I'm filthy!"

In one swift motion, Isabella closed the gap, wrapping Olivia in a firm embrace, leaving no room for escape.

"Olivia, who made you feel this way? Remember, to me, you're always the purest woman."

Isabella's confident voice resonated above Olivia, making her tremble. Looking up, she found herself lost in Isabella's deep, dark eyes.

Olivia's heart raced uncontrollably.

No, I can't be so selfish! I don't deserve someone as wonderful as this!

With every ounce of strength, Olivia broke free from Isabella's arms, tears streaming down her face as she cried, "Isabella, we need to break up!"
