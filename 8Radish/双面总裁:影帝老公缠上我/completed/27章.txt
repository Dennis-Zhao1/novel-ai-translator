Title: The Gift of Lucas Wright

Lucas Wright couldn't help but feel a little nervous. He had heard that the way to a woman's heart was through thoughtful gifts and spending time together. But he wasn't sure where to start. "Uh, maybe just give her something she likes? You know, to show her how you feel. And, well, make sure to see her often. There's that saying... what is it? Time is the killer of all feelings, and... the early bird gets the worm, right? Forgive me, I haven't read many books."

"Early bird gets the worm," Isabella Peterson mumbled to herself, suddenly shouting, "That guy!"

Lucas Wright nearly tripped over a bottle at the shout, "Sir!"

"Olivia Stewart is living with some guy, and their rooms are only separated by a wall. He's the early bird here! No way, absolutely not!"

Isabella Peterson staggered to her feet, kicking aside the bottles as she went, "Call Amy Green right now!"

"Uh, sure, sir, but how about we step outside first? Maybe change your clothes and sober up a bit before making the call?"

"No time, make the call now! I can't let this affect my pursuit!"

"Alright, alright, I'm on it!"

Lucas Wright helped steady Isabella as they left the wine cellar. A servant immediately offered a sobering cup of coffee, and Isabella, with a clear yet slightly intoxicated gaze, called Amy Green.

Amy Green, Isabella's assistant, was enjoying a day off when the call came in. Lounging in comfort, he was reluctant to answer, but a quick glance at the screen changed his mind. "Amy Green, looks like it's your boss!" the woman beside him said.

With a sigh, Amy Green reached for the phone, "Boss!"

"Cancel all my appointments for the next month!"

Amy Green was taken aback by the slurred command, "Are you serious? We've got five major campaigns this month! I mean, yeah, it's your money, but isn't this a bit much?"

"Who's the boss here?"

Amy Green deflated, "You are, boss. Whatever you say!" But then, excitement surged through him, "Does this mean I get an extra month off?"

"Once I win her over, you can have a year off!"

Amy Green stared at the phone, wondering if Isabella was serious or just drunk. Wait, did he say he's chasing a woman?

The next morning, in the sunny apartment complex, Olivia Stewart woke up. Stretching and yawning, she thought nothing felt better than waking up naturally in her own cozy space.

Suddenly, a handsome face appeared before her, causing her to scream and jump up, "Isabella Peterson! Am I dreaming? How did you get in?"

"Through the front door, of course."

"You're scaring me!"

Isabella Peterson, looking a bit awkward, mumbled, "I'm here to give you a gift."

"A gift? At this hour?" Olivia pointed at the bump on her forehead, "Is this it?"

Isabella glanced at the bump, a hint of concern in his eyes, and gently rubbed it, "Does it hurt?"

Olivia found herself staring into his deep eyes, momentarily forgetting to push him away. An ambiguous warmth filled the air between them.

After a moment, Olivia snapped back to reality and pushed him away, "Isabella, you said 'get lost' yesterday, and now you're here at my place! What's going on?"

Isabella remembered his mission, "I have something to give you!"

Reluctantly, Olivia followed him to the living room, where a line of bodyguards in black stood. They each held a large suitcase, and Lucas Wright, looking like a cheerful Buddha in his butler uniform, greeted her with a bow, "Good morning, Olivia!"

Finally, a step up from calling her "Miss Whatever."

Olivia surveyed the room, noticing Ethan King being held by two guards. She frowned at Isabella, "Why are they holding him?"

"Just making sure he doesn't cause trouble."

Isabella led Olivia to a small sofa, now covered with white towels. "Look at what I got you."

With a gesture, the bodyguards placed the suitcases on the table and opened them one by one. Olivia's eyes widened in disbelief.

Boxes filled with cash—dollars, all of them.

Olivia felt her lips dry as she pointed, "Isabella, this is for me?"

"Yes," Isabella said, wrapping an arm around her waist, "Surprised? Touched?"

Michael Wright's information was spot on—she did like money. But Olivia was more stunned than pleased. She couldn't help but think that no one gives such extravagant gifts without a hidden agenda.

"Why would you give me so much money?"

"Because I want to."

"I don't want it."

"Olivia, have you lost your mind? You usually pinch pennies, and now you refuse this?"

Olivia was surprised to hear him use her real name. Was he finally seeing her as herself and not someone else?

"Say something, are you dumbfounded?"

"Isabella, is this really your gift to me?"

"Yes!"

Olivia chuckled, "Is this your first time giving a gift to a girl?"

Isabella's face showed a hint of embarrassment as he glanced at Lucas, blaming him for the terrible advice.

Lucas stood silently, not daring to make a sound.

Olivia turned to Isabella, "Are you trying to court me?"

"Straight to the point? Olivia, aren't you supposed to be subtle?"

After a pause, Isabella admitted quietly, "Yes."

"Because I look like someone else?"

Isabella's face darkened, "You are her!"

Lucas advised him to move on, but Olivia kept bringing it up.

Olivia stood, "Take it back, I don't want it!"

Isabella followed her, "Olivia, if you refuse, I'll have to make you take it!"

"Isabella, you're shameless!"

Olivia spun around, colliding into Isabella's chest. "Oof..."

Isabella, caught off guard, tripped over Olivia, and they both fell through the door onto the cold, hard floor.

Instinctively, Isabella wrapped his arms around Olivia, cushioning her fall with his own body.

On top of him, Olivia's face burned as their lips brushed. She quickly pulled back, but Isabella's hand gently held her in place.

"Ouch..."

Lucas discreetly closed the door behind them.

After a long moment, Olivia broke free, jumping to her feet and holding her cheek.

What's with him? His chest felt like iron, and she hit her tooth. What was he playing at?

"Did I hurt you? Let me see."

Isabella's voice held genuine concern as he looked at her, then chuckled slightly at her swollen lips.

When he saw the bump on her forehead, guilt and tenderness filled his eyes. He gently rubbed it again.

Olivia tilted her head, her eyes mesmerized by his chiseled profile. She found herself entranced by his strong jawline, straight nose, and long lashes.

She admitted she was a sucker for a good-looking face!

Unbeknownst to her, while she admired Isabella, he was equally captivated by her.

Isabella towered over her, his gaze softening as it fell on her delicate features. She was even more beautiful than he remembered.

Isabella's hand moved from her forehead, tracing lightly across her face.
