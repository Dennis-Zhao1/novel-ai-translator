Title: The Contract

"Come on, no need to coddle me like I'm a three-year-old!" Olivia Stewart scoffed, rolling her eyes as she glanced at the contract Lucas Wright held in his hands. With a resigned sigh, she took it from him. "Lucas, go on and busy yourself with something else."

Lucas chuckled, his grin as wide as a Cheshire cat's. "I'll get the kitchen to whip up a candlelit dinner for you two lovebirds!"

Olivia looked down at the contract, the paper feeling as heavy as a ton of bricks. She didn't even bother to read it; her eyes were glued to the signature line, blank and waiting for her name.

As she stared, memories of Ethan King flashed before her eyes—Ethan standing up for her against Daniel Johnson, Ethan braving the pouring rain to pick her up from work, wrapping his coat around her head, Ethan staying by her bedside all night when she had a fever, his fumbling attempts to take care of her...

And then, unbidden, an image of Ethan getting roughed up by Isabella Peterson's beefy bodyguards popped into her mind. The kind of violence you see on TV, the kind that makes your skin crawl.

A shiver ran down Olivia's spine, snapping her back to reality.

In this city where she had no one, Ethan was her only friend. Even her own sister couldn't be relied upon, but Ethan was always there, rain or shine.

Now he was in trouble because of her, and she was still hesitating?

Being the girlfriend of someone like Isabella Peterson, even if it was just a rental arrangement, was a win, right?

With determination, Olivia grabbed a pen and gripped it tightly. Her teeth sank into her lower lip, leaving a pale impression.

She bent over the railing and carefully signed her name, "Olivia Stewart," on the dotted line.

A tear fell, soaking into the paper, followed by another.

Suddenly alert, Olivia wiped her eyes and noticed her mistake. She'd written "Olivia Stewart" instead of the alias she was supposed to use.

Darn Isabella Peterson, always calling her by that alias, messing with her head!

But what now? Olivia stared at the name she'd written, a lightbulb going off in her head, and she suddenly felt less distraught.

Clutching the signed contract, she approached Isabella's study and knocked. "Hey, Isabella, I signed the contract! Can you come take it?"

Silence.

"Or should I just slip it under the door?"

She crouched down, trying to slide the paper through the gap, then sat on the carpet, waiting. Still no response.

Frustrated, Olivia jumped up and yelled, "Isabella, take it or leave it! I'll just rip it up and face the music with Ethan!"

The door swung open, and there stood Isabella, looking as annoyed as ever. "You wish!"

Olivia handed over the contract with a sheepish grin. "Here you go!"

Isabella took it, glancing at the name, pausing for a moment, then silently tucked it away, moving to close the door. Olivia quickly wedged herself in the doorway, timidly asking, "So... you'll let Ethan go, right?"

Isabella's gaze raked over her, direct and intense. "We'll see how you behave."

Olivia felt her knees go weak and took a step back. "Uh... Lucas said there's a candlelit dinner tonight. I'll just check on that!"

And with that, she darted away.

Isabella watched her retreat with a mix of emotions flickering in his dark eyes. Picking up his phone, he dialed his security team. "Michael, get those documents to a handwriting expert. Now."

Downstairs, Olivia found Lucas Wright and beamed at him. "Lucas, Isabella agreed to release Ethan! Let's go get him!"

Lucas looked skeptical. "Really?"

"Absolutely! I handed over the signed contract, sweet-talked him a bit, and voilà, he agreed!"

Olivia nudged Lucas. "Come on, let's hurry before he changes his mind!"

Lucas hesitated, then confessed, "Olivia, the truth is... Ethan was never really in any danger."

"What?!" Olivia exploded, glaring at Lucas. "You're too old for these tricks, Lucas!"

Lucas looked sheepish, bowing slightly. "I'm sorry, Olivia. Your friend never got close enough to be in trouble."

"Lucas, I'm giving you the silent treatment for an hour! No, ten hours!"

Fuming, Olivia stormed off, eventually finding solace on a swing in the garden, staying there until sunset.

That evening, a servant invited Olivia to a Mediterranean-style dining room, where Lucas had arranged their candlelit dinner.

The room was a sea of blue and white, with soft lighting casting a romantic glow. A long table held golden candleholders and pristine white candles, their light warm and inviting.

Olivia wasn't in the mood to appreciate the ambiance. She sat down, head low, ignoring the covered dishes and the vintage wine perched on an elegant rack.

Reaching for the wine, Olivia poured herself a full glass.

A servant approached, concerned. "Olivia, should you wait for Isabella?"

"Pour it. Fill it up!"

"Yes, Olivia."

The servant efficiently filled her glass to the brim.

Olivia lifted it, downing it in one swift motion.

"Olivia..." The servant fretted. This was wine, not water!

Ignoring him, Olivia slammed the glass down. "More!"

"Olivia, maybe take a break? It's easy to get drunk on this."

"Don't want to pour? Fine!" Olivia grabbed the bottle herself. "I'll do it!"

The servant backed off, calling Lucas for help. "Lucas, where's Isabella? If he doesn't come soon, Olivia's going to be plastered!"

When Isabella entered ten minutes later, the wine bottle was two-thirds empty.

Olivia's cheeks were flushed, and she was giggling, making bunny ears on her head and singing, "I feel so cute and fuzzy..."

Isabella shook his head, a faint smile tugging at his lips. This was going to be an interesting evening.
