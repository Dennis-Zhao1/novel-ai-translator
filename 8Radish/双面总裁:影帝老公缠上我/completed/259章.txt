In a quiet, sterile hospital room, Olivia Stewart sat alone, her heart heavy with the weight of unspoken words. Lucas Wright, standing awkwardly by the door, had just informed her that she lacked the status to access Group Peterson's private medical team. It was a harsh reminder of her place—or lack thereof—in Isabella Peterson's world.

"Lucas, could you give me a moment?" Olivia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Of course, Olivia. I'll check with the doctor about any aftercare instructions," Lucas replied, stepping out with an apologetic glance.

As the door shut with a thud, anger stormed through the room. Isabella Peterson burst in, her face a mask of fury. Lucas, ever the diplomat, tried to intervene. "Miss Peterson, Olivia is pregnant."

"Leave us," Isabella commanded, her voice slicing through the air like a knife.

"Please, Miss Peterson—"

"Get out!" Isabella's voice was a thunderclap, leaving Lucas no choice but to retreat with one last worried look at Olivia.

With Lucas gone, the room fell silent, the tension between Isabella and Olivia crackling like a live wire. Olivia instinctively clutched her stomach, a protective gesture that only fueled Isabella's icy anger.

"Get rid of it," Isabella's words were cold, devoid of any hint of warmth or compassion.

"No," Olivia's voice was firm, though her heart felt as if it were breaking into a million pieces. She had made up her mind. She wouldn't give up her child, no matter what Isabella demanded.

"If you want to stay with me, you have to," Isabella insisted, her eyes hard and unyielding.

"I'd rather leave than do that!" Olivia shouted, her voice raw with emotion.

Isabella turned to leave, her back a wall of indifference. Olivia could no longer hold back her tears. "This is your child, Isabella! How can you be so heartless?"

Isabella paused at the door, a moment of hesitation before she turned back, her expression unreadable. "Olivia, have you forgotten? I can't have children. This can't be mine."

Her words were like a bucket of ice water, dousing whatever hope Olivia had clung to. She stared at the medical report Isabella threw in front of her, the harsh reality spelled out in black and white: Isabella Peterson, infertile.

The paper slipped from her fingers, fluttering to the floor. The truth was undeniable. Isabella couldn't father a child, yet here she was, pregnant.

"You see now?" Isabella's voice was laced with sarcasm. "This report matches the one from our family doctor. Are you saying both are wrong?"

Olivia had no answer. Her mind spun back to when Alexander Peterson had saved her, unconscious, from a locked room. Could something have happened then?

Isabella left, the door closing with a finality that echoed in Olivia's heart. She spent three days in the hospital, each day hoping Isabella would come, but she never did.

Olivia knew she had to make a decision. "I want to go home," she told Lucas, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Alright, Olivia. Once you're finished with today's IV, we'll head back," Lucas replied gently.

"No, I mean home home," Olivia clarified. "I can't stay here anymore, Lucas. Not like this."

Lucas sighed heavily. "I'll find a way to convince Miss Peterson to let you leave safely."

The day Olivia left the hospital, Isabella was nowhere to be seen. Her absence was a stark reminder of the distance that had grown between them.

"Thank you, Lucas," Olivia said, her gratitude genuine despite the storm of emotions within her.

"Don't mention it, Olivia. It's the least I can do," Lucas replied with a small smile. "Miss Peterson is seeing a counselor today," he added, almost as an afterthought.

A counselor? Olivia's mind raced. Was there more to Isabella's behavior than she realized? Could someone else be influencing her?

Lucas's bow of respect brought Olivia back to the present. "Please, Olivia, don't give up on her," he implored, tears glistening in his eyes.

"I don't want to, Lucas. But it's not just up to me," Olivia replied, her voice tinged with sadness.

As they reached the hospital entrance, Olivia handed her medical card to Lucas. "Could you hold this for a moment? I need to use the restroom."

"Of course, take your time," Lucas agreed, watching her walk away with a sense of unease.

When Olivia didn't return after half an hour, Lucas's worry grew. He searched the hospital, but she was nowhere to be found. Security footage revealed she had slipped out a side door, disappearing into the bustling streets.

Lucas immediately informed Isabella, who fell silent on the other end of the line. "Find her," she finally ordered, her voice carrying a hint of urgency. "And stop seeing that counselor. It's making everything worse."

Olivia was gone, her destination unknown. But one thing was clear—she needed to find her own path, even if it meant leaving everything behind.
