"Being a mom isn't easy," Isabella Peterson muttered under her breath, feeling the weight of Olivia Stewart's intense gaze. "I didn't do it!" she insisted, trying to keep her voice steady.

Olivia wasn't having it. "Isabella, I need the truth! I deserve to know what's really going on!"

Isabella's face flushed with frustration, her fists clenching as she whispered fiercely, "Olivia, I told you, I didn't do it! Can't we just move on from this?"

Olivia was just as stubborn. "Isabella, I'm Tommy's mom. I have every right to know the truth!"

Feeling the heat of the argument, Isabella stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her with a thunderous bang that echoed her inner turmoil.

Those negative emotions she had worked so hard to suppress erupted again, all thanks to Oliviaâ€™s relentless questioning. Why couldn't Olivia just let it slide and keep things peaceful?

Isabella retreated to the study, locking herself in. She needed space to calm down, away from the risk of saying or doing something she'd regret.

Opening the window, she lit a cigarette, a habit she only indulged in when things got really overwhelming. Olivia didn't like the smell, but at this point, Isabella needed something to burn away the stress.

Inside, Olivia's tears started to fall as soon as Isabella left. The truth about Tommy was painfully obvious, and she just wanted closure, no matter how bitter it might be.

Isabella might want to move on, but could he really? The turmoil on his face said otherwise. Olivia knew she couldn't just stand by and watch him suffer.

Olivia was a firm believer in pure, uncomplicated love. She couldn't settle for less, not even for Isabella, whom she loved deeply. She couldn't bear the thought of him compromising himself for her sake.

With resolve, Olivia wiped away her tears, got up, and went to freshen up. As she opened the door, she found Tommy standing there, looking way too serious for his young age.

Guilt washed over Olivia. Their argument must have affected Tommy, undoing the progress they'd made in helping him feel happy and secure.

Squatting down, Olivia ruffled his hair lovingly. "Tommy, how are you doing?"

Tommy nodded, his big eyes scanning Olivia's face for reassurance. He seemed to want a hug but hesitated.

Olivia didn't wait. She pulled him into a gentle embrace. Tommy squirmed a little but eventually relaxed against her shoulder, looking so vulnerable.

Sensing something was off, Olivia gently turned his face towards her. "Tommy, what's wrong?"

He shook his head, then glanced at Olivia, whispering, "Auntie Olivia, am I making you tired?"

Olivia chuckled softly, "Of course not! As long as you're healthy and happy, I'm never too tired!"

Tommy bit his lip, like he was making a big decision. Finally, he said, "Auntie, I want to go back to the orphanage."

Olivia froze, shocked by his words. "Tommy, did someone tell you something?"

Tommy shook his head fiercely. "I just don't want you to get sick because of me. I'm a bad kid, I..."

He was still just a little boy, and the weight of his emotions made him burst into tears.

Olivia waited for him to calm down before gently wiping his face. "Tommy, don't blame yourself. I was just resting, and now I'm fine! You're growing up to be a strong young man, and you know, strong men don't cry easily!"

"Okay," Tommy nodded earnestly, wiping his tears away. "Auntie Olivia, I promise I'll be better. I don't want you to get sick because of me ever again!"

Olivia hadn't expected that her efforts to teach Tommy independence would finally pay off because of this incident. She smiled warmly and held out her pinky. "Let's make a promise, okay?"

With that, Tommy ran off happily, not clinging to Olivia for hugs like he used to. Olivia felt a wave of relief.

Honestly, while she adored Tommy and wanted to fill his life with joy, she didn't want him to grow up dependent and weak. Seeing him embrace his own growth was the best outcome.

Leaving the room, Olivia headed towards the twins' room. Since Tommy had come back, her attention to them had waned, and the thought made her feel guilty.

Being a mom was tough. Being a mom to three kids and trying to do right by all of them? That was a whole other level of challenging.

The twins had just woken up from their nap and seemed to be in good spirits. Their nanny was getting them dressed and greeted Olivia with a polite bow. "Good afternoon, Olivia!"

"Skip the formalities," Olivia said, waving her hand. "Just get them dressed quickly so they don't catch a chill. How are Coco and Gigi doing?"

"Coco's fever broke last night, and the doctor said he's fine now," the nanny reported.

"Gigi still has a slight cough. The doctor recommended a couple more doses of cough syrup, and she should drink lots of warm water. The caregiver is getting the medicine now."

Olivia picked up Gigi, who immediately snuggled against her, making her heart melt. She showered her with kisses, feeling the irreplaceable bond of family.

Reflecting on her earlier resolve, Olivia chastised herself for even considering leaving.

After some time with Gigi, Olivia turned to Coco. Even at just a few months old, the twins had distinct personalities. Gigi was cheerful and clingy, while Coco was more serious, often imitating his dad's composed demeanor in a way that was both adorable and amusing.

"Come here, Coco, let mommy hold you!" Olivia called out with a smile.

Usually, Coco would reach out, not as eagerly as Gigi, but with a happy expression. Today, though, he turned away, his little face showing clear rejection.

Olivia's hand hung awkwardly in the air, her heart sinking with disappointment.

The nanny, noticing the tension, tried to hand Coco to Olivia, but the little guy stubbornly clung to the nanny's shirt, refusing to budge.

Olivia's hand dropped back, a mix of embarrassment and sadness washing over her. "It's okay."

The nanny, worried, apologized quickly, "I'm sorry, Olivia!"

Olivia gave a wry smile. "Kids are honest about their feelings. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to. It's not your fault."

Still, the nanny was anxious, fearing Olivia might replace her because of Coco's preference. The salary was great, but Coco himself was a joy to care for.

Summoning her courage, the nanny bowed slightly. "Kids naturally want to be close to their moms, but they follow their instincts. Whoever they're with most becomes their favorite. If you spend more time with Coco, he'll warm up to you again!"

Olivia sighed, feeling a pang of regret. "Yeah, I realize that now."

Today, she understood the twins needed her affection just as much as Tommy did. Though they were well cared for, their need for their mom was just as strong.

Tommy, being older, knew how to demand attention, but the twins could only accept what was given.

Coco's distance was built on moments of disappointment, and Olivia understood that now.

Reflecting on her earlier decision to leave them, Olivia felt a heavy weight on her chest.

She wanted to try again, to reach out once more, but she hesitated. Being rejected by Coco again might just break her.

"You should take the twins out for a walk. I'll join you later," Olivia said, holding back tears as she turned to leave.

Just then, a tiny hand grabbed her shirt.

Olivia stopped and turned to see Coco reaching out, clutching the red button on her shoulder.
