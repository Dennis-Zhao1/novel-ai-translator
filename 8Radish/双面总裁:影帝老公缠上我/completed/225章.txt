The Tough Stuff is for Me

“No, Isabella, don’t! Please don’t die!” Olivia was tossing and turning, eyes tightly shut, caught in the throes of a nightmare.

“Olivia, I’m right here! I’m not dead. Open your eyes. I’m right in front of you!” Isabella clutched Olivia’s hand, her voice soft and encouraging, as directed by the hypnotherapist standing nearby.

Suddenly, Olivia’s eyes flew open. “Isabella!”

“I’m here!” Isabella pulled Olivia into a hug, relief washing over her. “You’re finally awake!”

“I just had the worst nightmare. I dreamed you…” Olivia’s voice trailed off, her breath still coming in panicked gasps as she clung to Isabella.

“Isabella, I remember now. I remember everything. The name ‘White’—I made it up just to get close to you!” 

Isabella gently patted her back, damp with sweat. “I know, I know. Relax for now.”

The hypnotherapist exchanged a silent nod with Isabella, signaling that Olivia’s memory had successfully returned, and quietly left the room.

After some soothing words from Isabella, Olivia began to grasp the truth: her memories had been deliberately erased through hypnosis. Even so, she still pinched Isabella’s cheek a few times, just to be sure. “You’re really okay?”

Isabella gave her a resigned but affectionate look. “If you keep pinching like that, you might actually cause some damage!”

“But your mom told me you had…”

“In reality, my surgery was successful, and I recovered well.”

“So, your mom was behind this?”

“Yeah.” Isabella’s voice turned cold, a shadow crossing her eyes. It was hard to believe that the person who drove a wedge between them was none other than his own mother.

Olivia gave a bitter smile. “I get it. She wanted to make sure I’d give up on you. Once your surgery succeeded, you were back to being the heir to a fortune. How could she tolerate her son being linked to someone like me? To her, my existence was just a stain on your life.”

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll take care of it,” Isabella replied, his voice deep and reassuring. He pulled Olivia closer, his chin gently resting on her head.

Olivia snuggled into him, like a contented cat. “I finally understand why you went to such lengths to help me recover my memories. Remembering you is such a blessing!”

After a moment of quiet, Isabella lifted Olivia’s face with a playful grin. “Back then, did you become my girlfriend because of the money? Did you feel sorry for me?”

Seeing his serious expression, Olivia couldn’t help but tease him. “Yep, it was all about the money. I pitied you for it too!”

Isabella’s eyes went wide with mock outrage, his hands squeezing her cheeks into a puffy mess. “Olivia, you dare pity me? Are you looking for trouble?”

“Ouch!” Olivia playfully slapped his chest. “Idiot! I approached you for the money, but I’d never sell my feelings. I might have agreed out of pity, but never in that way!”

Isabella raised an eyebrow, teasingly. “In what way?”

Olivia’s cheeks flushed, and she gave him a mock glare. “You’re terrible!”

“Olivia, what I regret most is that one time, so I’ve always been looking for ways to make it up to you!”

Despite his sincere tone, the sentiment had its own playful twist.

Before Olivia could respond, Isabella had scooped her up into his arms, striding toward the VIP suite with purpose.

Having resolved their past, the two reached new heights of connection and intimacy.

As evening settled in, Olivia lay languidly against Isabella, her dark hair a stark contrast against her pale shoulders, like a beautiful painting.

Isabella’s gaze darkened, his throat moving involuntarily.

Olivia quickly pressed a hand against his chest. “Not again!”

Isabella’s lips curled into a mischievous smile, his brow arching in a way that was both devilish and charming. “Leave the hard work to me. You just close your eyes and enjoy.”

“Get out of here! You’re shameless!” Olivia rolled her eyes, playfully punching his chest.

But her playful hit was nothing more than a tickle to Isabella, and it only stirred something deeper within him.

Isabella moved closer, but Olivia pushed him away. “No, I’m really tired!”

“Alright!” Isabella backed off, though his interest was clearly piqued. “We’ll wait until you’re ready.”

“Mmm,” Olivia replied, only realizing a moment later what she’d agreed to. Her cheeks turned crimson as she shot him another glare.

This man, so cool and composed in public, was nothing but a cheeky devil in private!

Isabella chuckled softly, the sound vibrating in Olivia’s ears, comforting and strong.

Olivia shifted to find a comfortable spot in his arms, her gaze drifting to his handsome profile. She tugged at the stubble on his chin. “Isabella, why didn’t you look for me back then?”

Isabella paused, a hint of emotion flickering in his eyes.

“I clearly remember asking where ‘White’ was as soon as I woke up. My mother told me you couldn’t come because your mother was ill. She said I should focus on recovering and visit you later. Once I was discharged, she handed me a contract, saying you were just a girlfriend-for-hire, and that you’d run off to avoid trouble when I collapsed.”

“She lied!”

In her distress, Olivia accidentally pulled a hair from Isabella’s stubble.

Isabella kissed her hand tenderly, his lips brushing the spot she’d pinched. “I know, Olivia. I know you’ve been through so much. If only I’d realized sooner and come for you…”

“Back then, I was young and arrogant, embarrassed by my collapse during our time together. It was a blow to my pride, and I vowed to get stronger. I wanted to be ready to prove myself to you when you came crawling back!”

Olivia rolled her eyes at him. “They say wise people see wisdom, and fools see foolishness. You’re just obsessed. You’ve forgotten everything else, just focused on that! No wonder you almost pounced on me when we first met!”

Isabella smirked, raising an eyebrow. “Satisfied with your man now?”

Olivia gritted her teeth. “Satisfied!”

Could she say otherwise? Did she want to risk staying in bed all day?

Isabella brushed his nose against hers. “Glad to hear it. All my training wasn’t in vain.”

Olivia’s heart softened. Isabella spoke lightly of his transformation, but turning a frail body into a strong one was no small feat.

“Isabella…” Olivia’s voice was tender as she hugged him.

Isabella moved closer. “Darling, you’re asking for it now!”

“Ah, no!” Olivia tensed, shouting in mock horror.

Isabella pecked her lips but made no further moves, just teasing her.

Olivia relaxed, pinching his side in playful retaliation. What a tease!

Over the next few days, Olivia’s memories returned in bits and pieces. She remembered the dark days after leaving Isabella, the old man teaching her to make clay figurines, the judgmental looks from others, and the med school expulsion letter…

Then she recalled a startling fact: after separating from Isabella and facing blow after blow, she discovered she was pregnant!

That baby gave her the strength to keep going, but now she was struck with terror. Where was her child now?

Drenched in cold sweat, Olivia couldn’t bear to tell Isabella. She decided to seek out Sophie’s help instead.

Isabella already had a dossier on Sophie’s misdeeds against Olivia, but he hadn’t shown it to Olivia, waiting for the right moment.

As soon as he heard Olivia was going to see Sophie, Isabella dropped everything and hacked into Olivia’s phone to eavesdrop on their conversation.

Sure, it was a breach of privacy, but what wouldn’t he do for Olivia’s safety?

Driving, Isabella listened in, without a shred of guilt.

Inside the room, Olivia hesitated before Sophie, words on the tip of her tongue.

Sophie’s curiosity flared. She sensed Olivia had something to hide, so she put on a concerned face. “Sis, what’s wrong? Are you in trouble?”

“I… I…” Olivia stammered. “I need to know, about four or five years ago, did I… did I have a baby?”
