Title: Starstruck Sisters and the Enigmatic Actor

---

Sophie Cook was a mess of tears when she saw Olivia Stewart. Without a second thought, she ran into her sister's arms, crying her heart out. Olivia, unfazed by the mascara and tears ruining her dress, gently patted Sophie’s back and asked, “Sophie, what happened?”

It was a big deal because Sophie had always insisted on keeping her sister's job as a barista under wraps, fearing it might affect her budding acting career. Yet here she was, calling out “sis” in front of everyone for the first time ever. 

Between sobs, Sophie managed to explain, “I... I hired five people to help me... wait in line for tickets, but... but they still couldn’t get them!”

Tickets. Olivia glanced down at the ticket in her hand, biting her lip in thought. She knew how much she loved the superstar, Tanner Yi. Parting with the ticket would be tough, but seeing Sophie so distraught was even harder.

Before Olivia could decide, Sophie’s sharp eyes spotted the ticket in her sister’s hand. She snatched it up with a grin. “Sis, where’d you get this? You came here just to give it to me, didn’t you? You’re the best!”

Sophie’s words tumbled out like a rapid-fire machine gun, but her sweet, slightly babyish voice made it impossible to stay annoyed with her.

Olivia tried to interject, “Sophie, listen, this ticket...”

But Sophie cut her off again. “It’s a VIP ticket! I know, I know, you don’t need to worry about me finding the theater. Thanks, sis!” She blew a kiss and dashed off, leaving Olivia standing there, watching her sister flutter away like a butterfly.

The bodyguard by Olivia’s side asked, “Want me to get the ticket back for you?”

Olivia shook her head. “No need.” She had always given Sophie whatever she wanted, even if it meant giving up something she cherished. It had become second nature by now.

Sophie made her way through the VIP entrance, turning to wave at Olivia with a beaming smile. “Sis, you can head home now!”

Olivia looked up at the giant poster of Tanner Yi outside the theater, sighed deeply, and turned to leave. “Let’s go,” she said, her voice lacking its usual energy.

The bodyguard, sensing Olivia’s disappointment, suggested, “I could call Mr. Peterson for you. Maybe he can get you in?”

“Forget it,” Olivia replied. “Isabella’s away on business. I don’t want to bother him over something so trivial. And don’t you dare tell him about this. He’d be upset.”

“Yes, Olivia,” the bodyguard agreed, watching her with sympathy but keeping his thoughts to himself as they walked away.

Inside the theater, anticipation was building as the clock ticked down to Tanner Yi’s live appearance. In a dressing room backstage, Amy Green, the master of disguise, was putting the finishing touches on a transformation.

The person in the chair had striking short hair, deep-set dark eyes, a perfectly sculpted face, and an air of effortless charm. This handsome figure was none other than Isabella Peterson in disguise.

Amy stepped back to admire her handiwork, nodding with satisfaction. “Boss, you look amazing. This look is going to win over all the fans.”

Isabella smirked. “Are you complimenting my looks or your disguise skills?”

“Half and half,” Amy quipped. She then placed a light brown wig and blue contact lenses on Isabella, completing the transformation into the enigmatic actor, Tanner Yi.

No one knew that the idol everyone worshipped was actually the heir to a real estate empire. Normally, someone in Isabella’s position wouldn’t dream of entering showbiz, but he had managed to juggle both worlds seamlessly.

Isabella’s father had deemed acting a frivolous pursuit, forbidding him from tarnishing the family name with such antics. So, Isabella enlisted Amy to create a new persona, allowing him to pursue acting without the prying eyes of the media.

With his debut role in “The CEO’s Love,” Isabella became an overnight sensation as Tanner Yi. He didn’t need the money, so he avoided the industry’s usual politics, only appearing in projects under his family’s company, which skyrocketed his value and mystique.

As Isabella adjusted his tie, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and felt a flicker of unease. “Too flashy,” he muttered.

Amy leaned in to inspect. “I think it’s just right. It’s the image we set from the start.”

Isabella shrugged and put on a watch. “What if she recognizes me?”

“She won’t!” Amy reassured. “I’m a pro at this. Trust me.”

Isabella wasn’t convinced but let it go. “Others might not know me well enough, but she’s different. We’re always together.”

Amy cocked an eyebrow, teasing, “Oh?”

Isabella gave her a light kick to shut her up, as Amy chuckled and handed him a simple necklace with a hidden voice modulator. “This is the latest tech. It’ll alter your voice, making it deeper and more mysterious.”

Isabella tried it out, his voice turning huskier. “Good.”

Amy handed him a piece of gum. “Lemon flavor. Chew it before you greet Olivia Stewart as Tanner Yi. Makes the moment fresher.”

Isabella rolled his eyes but took it. “I don’t have bad breath.”

“Of course not! But women pick up on these things. If you want to keep your identity a secret, you have to think of everything.” Amy then spritzed some cologne around him. “A different scent helps too. If you’ve been up to something, they’ll sniff it out right away.”

“Speaking from experience?” Isabella asked dryly, pocketing the gum and cologne.

Amy grinned. “You know me. I’ve got a soft spot for this kind of stuff. With all the ladies I’ve got, things can get tight.”

“Double your pay,” Isabella said, surprising Amy.

“Really? Thanks, boss! I love you!”

Isabella laughed, shaking his head as he headed out. Amy followed, carrying the disguise kit like a prized possession. He was ready to enjoy the show from the sidelines, basking in the spotlight of his creation.

The theater was packed to the rafters, silence descending as the event began. The host took the stage, her voice cutting through the anticipation. “Ladies and gentlemen, fans of the incredible Tanner Yi…”
