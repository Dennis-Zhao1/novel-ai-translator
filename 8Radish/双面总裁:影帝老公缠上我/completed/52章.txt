Olivia Stewart had a unique way of showing jealousy, and it often involved Isabella Peterson. That afternoon, Lucas Wright had just come to announce lunch was ready when he accidentally walked in on a rather steamy scene. He quickly retreated, chuckling to himself about how Isabella and Olivia were making out on the weight bench. "Of all places," he thought.

Half an hour later, Olivia emerged from the room, her lips slightly swollen. She blushed furiously when she saw Lucas waiting outside, wishing she could disappear into the floor. Isabella, however, strutted out like a satisfied cat, casting a smug look at Lucas. "What are you laughing at? Never seen a personal trainer get personal with a client?" she quipped.

Olivia, still flushed, defended herself. "Hey! Who was the one who jumped on whom first?"

Lucas was amused by their playful banter. It was good to see the two finally on good terms again.

Later that day, while Isabella was busy in the study, Olivia tried calling Ethan King, but she couldn't get through. It was like he had vanished into thin air. She was desperate to find out what happened but knew Isabella could be a bit of a jealous type. Asking directly for help might backfire.

So, Olivia played it smart. She spent the afternoon bringing Isabella coffee, snacks, and all sorts of little favors, hoping to soften her up. Isabella pretended not to notice, enjoying the attention.

By evening, Olivia was at her wit's end and brought yet another cup of coffee into the study. "Fifth cup today, Olivia. Are you trying to keep me running to the bathroom or just keep me up all night?"

"I'm just trying to keep your energy up since you've been working so hard," Olivia replied sheepishly.

Isabella smirked, "You know, you're the best kind of energy boost."

Olivia blushed but didn't argue. Instead, she tried to steer the conversation to a more helpful place. "So, do you ever have to go to work, or do you just run everything from here?"

Isabella gave her a look. "I'm a boss, remember? I don't need to clock in anywhere. We've got teams handling all that real estate stuff."

Olivia nodded, feigning understanding, before finally getting to her point. "With all those connections, you must know a lot of people, right?"

Isabella caught on quickly. "Sure, finding out about someone or locating them is no big deal."

Olivia's eyes lit up. She hesitated but finally asked, "Can you find out where Ethan King is?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Why waste time on that guy? He's a fraud!"

Olivia was taken aback. "No way! Ethan wouldn't do that. He's a good person!"

Isabella scoffed, "You still don't get it, do you? Even when I told you who you really are, you wouldn't believe it. Now you can't see through Ethan King either?"

Olivia didn't buy it. "Even if he lied, there must be a good reason."

"Then why ask me?" Isabella snapped, annoyed by Olivia's persistence. She kicked Olivia out of the study, but Olivia wasn't giving up so easily. She followed Isabella around for days, trying to win her over with kindness.

Finally, Olivia decided to confront Isabella directly. "You know where Ethan is, don't you?"

Isabella sighed and pulled out a folder. "I already had him investigated."

Olivia's eyes widened with excitement. She reached for the folder, but Isabella locked it away before she could grab it.

"Hey!" Olivia protested.

Isabella's eyes locked onto hers, intense and unreadable. Olivia finally broke the silence with a quiet plea, "What will it take for you to let me see it?"

"Be my girlfriend," Isabella said, almost teasingly.

"Okay!" Olivia blurted out without hesitation, catching Isabella off guard. Isabella's expression darkened.

"Olivia Stewart!" Isabella barked, clearly frustrated.

Olivia was puzzled. "Did I say something wrong?"

"You know what I mean by 'girlfriend,' right? Not just a title."

Olivia nodded. "I get it."

"Then why did you agree so quickly?"

Olivia shrugged, unsure why Isabella seemed upset when she got what she wanted.

"Fine!" Isabella snapped. "If you're so eager to sacrifice yourself for him, who am I to stop you?"

Olivia sighed, realizing Isabella's possessive streak was showing. But underneath all that jealousy was something sweet, like a spoonful of honey mixed with vinegar.

There was a reason she agreed so quickly, beyond just finding Ethan. She didn't mind being with Isabella, even if it was just as a placeholder.

She opened her mouth to speak but decided against it. This was a secret she intended to keep.
