The Return of the Bossy CEO

Olivia Stewart was in a daze. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was something off about Isabella Peterson. Sure, they were technically the same person, but they felt like two entirely different people. Isabella Peterson was always hovering above everyone else, looking down his nose at the world. Today, though, he didn't even show up to the press conference, leaving her to navigate the chaos alone. That thought brought a sting of bitterness to her heart.

She glanced up at Tianyi, the man standing before her, and couldn't help but compare the two. Tianyi's hair was curlier, his skin fairer, and his voice carried a gentle rasp, unlike Isabella's deep and commanding timbre. Isabella's features were bold and sharp, while Tianyi's were more refined and soft. Isabella was all about authority and distance; Tianyi was like a warm breeze, considerate and gentle. Olivia found herself lost in thought, comparing every little detail.

Isabella Peterson, standing there as Tianyi, couldn't believe what he was seeing. Olivia was clearly mesmerized by him, but how could she be when she was supposedly enamored with another man? A man who was, in fact, him! He couldn't find the words to describe his feelings. He was jealous of himself! It was maddening, and he clenched his fists, trying to keep his cool.

"You two planning to gaze into each other's eyes until the end of time?" The teasing voice of Director Wang snapped them both back to reality.

"Uh, I..." Olivia blushed furiously, stumbling over her words in embarrassment.

"Getting into character quickly is a good thing!" Tianyi said smoothly, offering Olivia a way out of her awkwardness.

Olivia shot Tianyi a grateful look and smiled at him, a smile that made Isabella grind his teeth in frustration. This little thing dared to smile so brightly at another man!

In that moment, Olivia's internal comparison reached a conclusion. One was masculine, the other a bit of a devil, but both were strikingly handsome. Yet, their personalities were worlds apart. If Isabella had been here, he'd have probably criticized everything before storming off to find a private place to vent his annoyance. What Olivia didn't know was that Tianyi, standing before her, was secretly plotting similar thoughts.

Their interaction caused a frenzy among the journalists, who snapped photos like there was no tomorrow. Soon, the opening ceremony wrapped up, and everyone headed to the dressing rooms to change for the press conference.

Sophie Cook lingered behind, scratching the edge of a tea tray with her sharp nails. She had memorized her few lines and practiced her tea-serving routine endlessly, hoping to attract Tianyi's attention. But the entire ceremony had focused on Olivia and Tianyi, leaving her in the shadows, literally and figuratively.

Half an hour later, the main cast, now dressed in their formal attire, reappeared in the venue. The press conference was the main event, a chance for everyone to shine.

As Olivia and Tianyi appeared together, the cameras started flashing again. Olivia's "Moonlight Fairy" reputation had spread like wildfire online, overshadowing her previous negative press. Most of the internet hailed her and Tianyi as the perfect couple, while a small fraction could only express their envy and frustration, powerless to do anything more than grumble to themselves.

"The highly anticipated 'Send an Angel to Love You' is finally set to begin filming. With an all-star cast, including the stunning new talent Olivia Stewart, we're excited to bring you this fresh and romantic story. Let's welcome our main cast to the stage!" The host's vibrant voice echoed through the massive venue.

Olivia took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. This was her first time in front of such a large crowd, and the presence of tabloid reporters made her anxious. The incident with Daniel Johnson had left her wary of the press.

Suddenly, a warm hand covered hers, its reassuring heat calming her instantly. She turned to find Tianyi beside her, offering a supportive smile. "Let's go. There's a first time for everything."

"Okay." Olivia nodded, her nervousness giving way to a soft smile as she and Tianyi stepped onto the main stage.

Sophie Cook, meanwhile, was struggling to keep up, having been delayed by her elaborate outfit and last-minute touch-ups. But as she reached the backstage entrance, security stopped her.

"What do you mean I can't go in?" she snapped, her eyes flashing.

"Sorry, but the press conference is only for the main cast," one of the guards explained coolly.

"But the company notice said I should be here!" Sophie protested.

"It means you should be present, but you won't be participating," the guard replied.

Sophie, furious and feeling sidelined, tried to force her way in, only to be firmly held back. "If you keep this up, we'll have to remove you and report your behavior," the guard warned.

Defeated, Sophie had no choice but to retreat, her dreams of outshining Olivia dashed.

Back on stage, the flash of cameras was blinding, but Tianyi's steady presence kept Olivia grounded. During the Q&A session, the journalists went wild, shouting their questions all at once.

Tianyi took the microphone, his voice cutting through the chaos. "One at a time, or you can all leave." His commanding tone silenced the room immediately.

Olivia glanced at him, momentarily taken aback. For a second, she thought she heard Isabella's voice in his words. Maybe she was just imagining things after all the stress.

"Any questions?" Tianyi asked, his gaze sweeping the room.

After a brief pause, a reporter stood up, gingerly asking, "Mr. Tianyi, we've noticed you holding Olivia's hand quite affectionately. Is this for the sake of the storyline, or is it love at first sight?"

Olivia's face turned crimson. These reporters didn't miss a thing! She tried to pull her hand away, but Tianyi held on firmly.

"Leave it to me," he whispered, his voice a comforting presence. Olivia stayed by his side, maintaining her serene smile.

Tianyi met the reporter's gaze, his light blue eyes holding a hint of chill. The reporter, caught in his stare, felt a bead of sweat form on his brow.
