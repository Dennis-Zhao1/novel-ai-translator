Sure, let's dive into the story where drama is always around the corner.

So, Olivia Stewart was finally getting some peace after the recent media fiasco. Thanks to the loud drama Daniel Johnson and Emily Young were stirring up, her own scandal had been overshadowed. This was exactly what Isabella Peterson and her buddy Ethan King had planned when they orchestrated the whole Emily Young situation. It was all about diverting attention.

Isabella, with a playful smirk, ruffled Olivia's hair, "Feeling better now?"

"Totally!" Olivia nodded eagerly. "With those two taking all the heat, I get to chill. But hey," she added, looking seriously at Isabella, "I was totally innocent. They, on the other hand, totally deserved it!"

Isabella, always the protective friend, gave Olivia a playful nudge on the nose, "See, that's why you shouldn't get too caught up in what people say. Just live your life. People love chasing the next big thing. Give it a while, and this will all blow over."

Olivia tilted her head, "Isabella, are you trying to comfort me? Isn't it a bit late for that?"

Isabella chuckled, remembering how he had been Olivia's knight in shining armor when the paparazzi were all over her. His dark eyes sparkled with mischief, and his voice was laid-back, "Oh? Too little, too late?"

Before Olivia knew it, Isabella was playfully poking her side, causing her to curl up like a shrimpy, her face turning bright red as she squealed, "Isabella, you know that's not what I meant! Can't you focus on the real issue here?"

Isabella grinned, "You saying I'm not focused enough?" His hand playfully tickled her side again.

"Ahh!" Olivia shrieked, falling back into her seat. "You're such a jerk, Isabella!"

Leaning in with an impish grin, Isabella continued his playful torment, "Not focused enough, huh?"

"No, stop it, Isabella!" Olivia begged, a mix of embarrassment and urgency in her voice. "We're in a car! The windows aren't even tinted!"

"See, that's why I like you, Olivia. Always thinking ahead," Isabella said, finally pressing the button to close the windows.

Olivia rolled her eyes internally, thinking, "Seriously, Isabella? My point was about keeping things decent in public!"

"Uh, I think I saw Ethan's car over there. Is he still around?" Olivia randomly blurted out, trying to distract Isabella. If his playful side continued, she'd never get out of the car without dying of embarrassment.

Isabella paused at the mention of "Ethan." Lately, Olivia had been calling him "Ethan" in a much more familiar tone, which, for some reason, irked Isabella.

"Do you like that guy?" Isabella asked, his voice deceptively calm but with a hint of something else.

Olivia sensed the danger in the air. "Uh..."

She was about to clarify, but then, remembering how Isabella always had the upper hand, she cheekily said, "Why don't you guess?"

The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them. Isabella's face was suddenly very close, his tall frame looming over her.

"I don't guess, Olivia. I just take," he said with a sly grin.

"Isabella, no—" Olivia's words were swallowed as Isabella pulled her into a kiss.

From outside, Amy Green and Michael Wright, who had been waiting nearby, pretended not to notice the unfolding scene, turning away to give them some privacy.

Two hours later, Isabella tapped on the window for Michael to start the car. Michael, ever the professional, acted as if nothing unusual had happened, stepping into the driver's seat without a word.

Amy, having witnessed the whole spectacle, discreetly moved out of sight, planning to return Isabella's other car later.

In the backseat, Olivia, wrapped in Isabella's shirt, was leaning against the seat, her face still flushed with the embarrassment of it all. Even with the partition up, separating the front from the back, she felt incredibly self-conscious.

Isabella lounged casually beside her, looking utterly satisfied, like a lion that had just feasted. He reached out to pull Olivia closer, but she shifted away, still sulking.

This little thing was still mad!

Isabella's grin widened, a mix of charm and mischief, as he lightly tapped Olivia on the back. She ignored him.

His fingers found their way to her again, and Olivia scooted further away. With a playful raise of his eyebrow, Isabella's hand moved lower until it brushed against her skin, making Olivia spin around, glaring at him.

"You better stop!" she warned, cheeks puffed in defiance.

Isabella, undeterred, pressed a teasing finger against her side, "Boop!"

It felt oddly satisfying.

"Isabella!" Olivia huffed, her eyes flashing with frustration.

"Hey, you told me to!" Isabella feigned innocence, then added with a cheeky grin, "But it does feel nice."

"You!" Olivia wanted to smack that annoyingly handsome face, but she was too worn out to lift a finger. Her whole body felt like it had been through a workout.

Forget it. Never compete with Isabella in the thick-skinned department.

With a resigned sigh, Olivia gave him a side-eye, choosing silence over engagement.

Isabella, ever the charmer, wrapped Olivia in his arms, letting her rest against his firm chest. He gently stroked her silky hair, his voice soft and coaxing, "Alright, no more sulking. I just couldn't help myself."

Up in the front, Michael Wright nearly lost control of the wheel, startled by the rare sound of his boss speaking so tenderly. The car jolted a little, earning Michael a swift kick from Isabella from the back seat.

Michael straightened up immediately, focusing intently on the road.

Isabella turned back to Olivia, playfully nudging her, "Come on, give me a smile."

Olivia shot him a look of mock disdain, thinking how outdated that line was.

With a sigh of mock defeat, Isabella tried again, "Okay, okay. I was just being greedy. But hey, can you blame me? You're irresistible!"

Olivia rolled her eyes, feeling her face heat up. How does he turn it back on me?

She thought about the drama with Daniel Johnson and Emily Young, quickly grabbing her tablet to catch up on the latest updates.

Isabella, draping an arm around her, watched her browse the gossip with a relaxed smile.

If his bodyguards or anyone from his circle saw him like this, their jaws would surely drop.

Back in the media circus, Daniel and Emily's court case had turned into a shouting match and was going nowhere. But it did give them another burst of online fame. Some people suspected their whole legal battle was just a publicity stunt, leading to a fresh wave of online outrage and ridicule.

The case also dragged in a certain Mr. Wang, who had infamously advertised on Daniel's social media. He was now labeled the worst businessman ever, facing massive backlash and a boycott on his products. He was likely on the brink of shutting down, with no more payments to Daniel.

Daniel, who'd squandered his earnings at the casino, was now broke, and along with Emily, was caught in endless bickering over their child's custody.

But that's a story for another day.

Olivia, after reading the saga, tossed the tablet aside with a disdainful snort, "They brought this on themselves. It's like selling your dirty laundry for cash—I've never seen anything so shameless! And then to take it to court? Perfect match made in scandal heaven."

Isabella, pleased that Olivia had no sympathy for Daniel, leaned down to plant a gentle kiss on her forehead, tossing the tablet aside, "Don't waste your time on people like that. Let's just enjoy ourselves."

That's when Olivia realized she was leaning against Isabella's solid chest, feeling the warmth radiating through his thin shirt. Her cheeks flushed, and she eyed him warily, "What's on your mind?"

Isabella, with a mischievous glint in his eye, smirked, "You."

"You..." Olivia started, eyebrows knitting, ready to escape.

Isabella quickly wrapped an arm around her, "Okay, okay. I'm just thinking. You're tired; get some rest."

Olivia, skeptical, watched him closely, but seeing no further mischief in his eyes, she relaxed a little, settling into his embrace, half-closing her eyes as she mumbled, "It's all your fault! I was planning to wrap up early today and catch up with crazy Amy for dinner."

As she drifted off, Isabella just held her close, a content smile on his lips.
