Olivia Stewart found herself in a bit of a pickle. She stood there, looking at the contract in her hand, realizing it was never really her problem to begin with. It was all about Isabella Peterson and Bai Yike, not her. Still, she couldn't help but feel caught up in the whirlwind of drama.

Lucas Wright, who looked more than a little concerned, asked, "You okay, Olivia?"

Olivia gave him a mischievous grin. "I'm fantastic!"

Lucas pointed at the contract. "And that..."

Olivia playfully flicked the paper with her finger. "Lucas, don't you find it odd that a guy like Isabella Peterson, who's all tall, dark, and handsome, needs to rent a girlfriend? I mean, is there something wrong with him?"

"Shhh—"

"Did I hit the nail on the head? Come on, Lucas, spill the tea!"

Lucas gave her a look that said he was this close to flicking her on the forehead. "Olivia, you can't let him hear that. The one thing he wants to prove is that he's perfectly capable. He's not avoiding you because he can't; it's because he cares."

Lucas gave her a once-over. "And by the way, don't say I didn't warn you. The guy works out every day. He can do push-ups for hours. You might be in over your head."

Olivia's cheeks turned crimson. "I wasn't thinking about that!"

"Well, if you have any terms, let me know. I can pass them along to him. To be honest, he's never really put in effort for a woman before, but you're clearly different to him."

Olivia handed the contract and pen back to Lucas, resolute. "Lucas, as tempting as the money is, I prefer a simple, happy life. I don't want to sell myself, especially under someone else's name! Tell him to find someone else."

Lucas sighed. "I'll let him know. And, by the way, be careful. Someone's been causing trouble on the island lately."

"Trouble?" Olivia asked, an uneasy feeling creeping in.

"Yeah, they caught a guy today. Young, good-looking, pale skin, talks a bit flamboyantly."

"Ethan King!" Olivia gasped, realizing the truth. "Isabella Peterson caught Ethan King, didn't he? That jerk! I'm going to see him!"

"Charging in like that might only make things worse for your friend."

Olivia hesitated, then sighed. "Fine, I'll sign. But only if he lets Ethan go."

"Better tell him yourself. He's in his study."

With determination, Olivia headed towards Isabella Peterson's study. She paused outside, nerves building up. After a deep breath, she knocked.

"Come in."

His voice was calm yet authoritative. Olivia entered, finding him focused on his computer, tapping away at the keyboard, his profile sharp and handsome.

"Isabella..."

The keyboard kept clicking, ignoring her presence.

Okay, playing hard to get, huh? Olivia leaned closer, feigning curiosity. "What are you working on?"

He continued typing. Olivia raised her voice, "Are you deaf, Isabella?"

He frowned, turning slightly. "Leave."

Olivia felt the sting of embarrassment. But for Ethan’s sake, she had to swallow her pride.

She tried a different approach, offering to massage his shoulders. His typing slowed, the rhythm disrupted by her gentle touches, a mix of annoyance and something else flickering in his eyes.

Yet, the moment he remembered why she was buttering him up, the annoyance won out.

"Are you a hacker?" she asked, trying to lighten the mood.

"No."

"Then what?"

"The hacker's master."

She was momentarily speechless. "Are you making a virus?"

"Software."

"Impressive."

"I'm impressive in many ways."

Another silence fell between them. Olivia struggled to find the right words to ask for Ethan's release without setting him off.

"Isabella, I’ll sign the contract, but..."

"Olivia, you think you can negotiate terms with me? I'm not interested in you anymore."

What?! That was unexpected. He’d gone through all this trouble for the contract, and now he didn’t care?

"Isabella, I—"

"Get out!"

Olivia bristled, hands on her hips. "You're ridiculous! Why did you capture Ethan then?"

"He trespassed."

"You’re using him to manipulate me! I agreed to your terms, what more do you want?"

He stood, towering over her. "Olivia, don’t flatter yourself." His finger jabbed her cheek. "You think I need you for anything? That contract was just a reminder of your past."

"Then let me leave!"

He pointed at the door. "Go!"

Olivia’s heart ached, tears welling up in her eyes. She stepped back, voice tinged with desperation. "Can you at least release Ethan? He’s only in trouble because of me."

"Are you crying for him?"

"No..."

"For that flamboyant fool?"

Olivia blinked hard, refusing to let the tears fall. She couldn’t admit that his words had hurt her more than she expected.

"Leave! Now!"

He pushed her out, slamming the door shut. She stumbled, catching herself on the railing. The door closed, leaving her outside, alone with her thoughts.

Again, she’d provoked him.

She crouched down, hiding her face in her hands, trying to hold back her tears.

"Olivia."

Lucas Wright offered her a tissue, crouching beside her with a gentle smile.

She wiped her eyes, standing up. "No, thanks, Lucas."

He chuckled, unfazed by her cold tone. "Olivia, he may seem harsh, but he’s got a good heart. Just give him some time."

Olivia wasn’t so sure. But for now, she had to find a way to free Ethan without further inciting Isabella’s wrath.
