Olivia Stewart was caught in a whirlwind of emotions. Isabella Peterson, with her charming British accent, had just delivered an apology in twenty different languages. Olivia felt both impressed and bewildered.

"What did you just say?" she asked, her eyebrows raised in confusion.

"Twenty ways to say 'I'm sorry,'" Isabella replied, a smirk playing on her lips.

Olivia pouted, trying to mask her amusement. "No, I want to hear it in English!"

Isabella's hands clenched and relaxed by her sides as she tried to muster the courage. Finally, she whispered, "I'm sorry."

"Too quiet! I didn't hear you!" Olivia pressed, her playful demeanor intact.

Taking a deep breath, Isabella shouted from the depths of her chest, "I'M SORRY!"

Startled, Olivia rubbed her ears. "You don't have to shout at me like that! Can't you be sincere without scaring me?"

Isabella was on the brink of exasperation. Too soft, too loud—nothing seemed right for Olivia. But remembering her own previous harshness toward Olivia, she calmed herself and said gently, "Olivia Stewart, I was wrong, and I'm sorry."

"That's more like it!" Olivia turned her head away, feigning indifference, but her eyes were already glistening with unshed tears.

Isabella's heart ached seeing Olivia's vulnerability. He quickly enveloped her in a hug, his voice low and earnest. "Olivia, I promise I won't hurt you again. You have no idea how afraid I am of losing you, especially after what happened last time. Seeing you worried about someone else made me insanely jealous. I couldn't control myself."

Olivia nestled closer to him, her voice soft. "I get it. I feel insecure too. But Isabella, please don't be jealous without reason. We all have people we care about outside of love—family, friends. However, you are my most important person. I'd do anything for you. So, don't compete with them."

Isabella tightened his embrace, unable to find the words but hoping his actions conveyed his sincerity.

"But..." Olivia's sudden pause caused Isabella's heart to skip a beat.

"You being mean and kicking me out won't just be forgotten!" she declared with a mischievous glint.

Isabella rubbed his temples, recalling all the apologies and explanations he'd already given, including dealing with the aftermath of that mess with Sophie Cook. What more could Olivia possibly want?

As Olivia walked away with her head held high, Isabella felt the sting of her departure. That night, when he finished up his work in the study and tried to enter their room, he found it locked.

Still angry?

Frustration boiling, Isabella knocked, his voice laced with irritation, "Olivia Stewart, open the door! If you don't, I'll break it down, and you'll regret it!"

Inside, Olivia leaned against the door, listening to Isabella's increasingly loud knocks. Her heart was conflicted. Deep down, she had already forgiven him, especially after seeing Ethan King lying motionless in the hospital. Life was unpredictable, and she wanted to cherish what she had.

Yet, she needed to hold her ground now, not just because of her unresolved feelings but also because Sophie Cook had accidentally injured her arm today, and she couldn't let Isabella find out.

After a few minutes of fruitless knocking, Isabella was about to kick the door down when Lucas Wright rushed over. "Don't, sir! Please don't!"

Isabella glared at him, his patience wearing thin. "It's just a door. Why do you care?"

"It's not the door, sir. It's Olivia Stewart. You care about her, right?"

"Of course!" Isabella lowered his foot, knowing that Olivia was the reason he hadn't already kicked it down.

"Sir, sometimes when women are mad, they're not truly angry. They're just throwing a little tantrum. You need to soothe them, not use force. Otherwise, they might really get angry."

Isabella cast a skeptical glance at Lucas. "How do you know so much?"

Lucas looked embarrassed. "I grew up in the Peterson family estate. The old masters had many wives. I've seen a lot."

Considering Lucas's words, Isabella hesitated. Asking for advice felt like admitting defeat, yet he couldn't deny the truth in them.

Turning away from the closed bedroom door, Isabella headed back to the study. The thought of being locked out by his own girlfriend was mortifying.

The next morning, Olivia left for the hospital early, and Isabella still hadn't been allowed into the room that night. Annoyed, he decided to give her the cold shoulder, pretending to be unbothered.

On the third day, when the door slammed shut behind him again, Isabella finally lost it, kicking a nearby antique vase across the room.

"Sir!" Lucas called out, clearly nervous. These past days, with Olivia ignoring him, Isabella had become a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at the slightest provocation.

Stomping back to his study, Isabella called Michael Wright. "Can that guy be moved yet?"

"Good, transfer him to another hospital, as far away as possible. Send him abroad!"

Lucas hesitated, following behind. "Sir, won't Olivia be upset?"

"I'm finding that guy the best hospital and treatment. Why would she be mad? She should be thanking me!"

Lucas had nothing more to say, but he added, "Sir, I think finding a way to make up with Olivia would be more effective than sending Ethan King away. The further you send him, the more she'll worry. Better to keep him where you can see him. Once Ethan wakes up and is fine, Olivia won't be as concerned."

"Make up? How?"

Isabella rubbed his temples in frustration. He'd tackled complex code and massive projects but found himself utterly clueless about appeasing a woman.

"Maybe ask Amy Green? He's always bragging about being a dating expert."

Isabella hesitated before Lucas eagerly called Amy Green.

Soon, Amy's cheerful voice came through the phone. "Boss, if you need tips on wooing a woman, you've come to the right person. I'm a dating guru..."

"Cut the crap!"

"Uh, right. Well, women love romance. You could light heart-shaped candles outside her window, shout 'I love you,' or climb up to her balcony at night, but make sure there are plenty of people watching. She'll love the attention..."

Isabella hung up with a scowl. No way was he doing something so cheesy and embarrassing.

Lucas suggested, "Sir, maybe you could just say something sweet to Olivia? If it's too embarrassing, try texting her or sending a voice message."

That idea seemed more plausible. Isabella's expression softened slightly, but then he frowned again.

What would he say?

He'd been hailed as an acting prodigy, yet he hadn't truly been in the entertainment industry long enough to master sweet talk. In his first role as a CEO, he was always being pursued by women and never had to say anything romantic. In the second, with Olivia, he'd said all the romantic lines imaginable, but she would know he was just reciting them.

Desperate, he turned to the internet for help.

Isabella searched for the most romantic, cheesy, funny, and even risqué lines he could find. There was plenty to choose from.

He clicked on "most risqué lines," reading them aloud: "Your dimples don't have wine, but they make me drunk like a dog."

What nonsense! Next!

"Every day, all I want to do is have three meals with you."

That one's nice, but should he change the number to... N?

"Every time I see you, my heart races, but nothing else does."

...

Isabella read through the list, scrutinizing each line. What should he send?

Lucas, eavesdropping, recorded Isabella's mutterings and sent them to Olivia, one by one.

In her room, Olivia was strumming her bass, working on a new song. She'd been inspired during the filming of "Send an Angel to Love You" and had written a song called "Secretly Falling for You."

These days were tough for both Isabella and her. Visiting Ethan in the hospital wasn't just about seeing him; it was also a chance to secretly change her bandages. She knew Isabella was nearing his breaking point, and she needed to heal before he found out about her injury.

As she worked on her music, she couldn't help but smile at Isabella's attempts to reach out, knowing she had to be careful about when to finally reconcile.
