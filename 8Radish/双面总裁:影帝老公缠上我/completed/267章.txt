He’s not even my real father.

James Cook leaned back in his chair, slipping a credit card into his pocket with a smug grin plastered across his face. “I don’t know, it’s been years. How am I supposed to remember?”

“Liar! How dare you try to fool me!” Olivia Stewart was furious, her voice rising as she confronted the man she thought was her father.

James clutched the card tightly, his smug expression unwavering. “That half a million dollars is mine now. It was hush money, not for information about the kid. If you want to know where your child is, you’ll have to cough up another half a million!”

“In your dreams!” Olivia’s chest heaved with anger.

“This is pure extortion! I could report you!”

“Go ahead, report me!” James taunted, arms spread wide as if inviting her to try. “I don’t care about my reputation, unlike some people who do.”

“You’re shameless!” Olivia spat, her voice filled with contempt.

“Shameless? Compared to that old fox, Mr. White, I’m practically a saint! I raised his daughter all these years, didn’t I?”

Olivia’s mind went blank, reeling from the revelation. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb with me! Just like your mother!” James sneered, his face twisted with bitterness. “Do you know how long I’ve been living with this? Your mom was a maid for the Whites, and she hooked up with Mr. White. She was already pregnant when she married me! I thought I was getting a beautiful wife, but instead, I got a lifetime of raising someone else's kid!”

Olivia stared at his ranting mouth, her mind half understanding, half refusing to accept the words. Childhood memories flooded back, making sense of why her parents never seemed to like her. Why she always had to give way to Sophie Cook. She wasn’t their real daughter—just an unwanted burden.

Olivia bit her lip, refusing to let the tears pooling in her eyes fall. James took advantage of her silence to make a quick escape.

Not far away, a man wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap snapped a few photos and disappeared into the crowd.

Back at her apartment, Olivia’s face was pale, more so than ever before. Ethan King, her roommate, noticed immediately. “Olivia, where have you been? You look awful.”

Olivia waved him off, trying to keep it together. “I just went to the grocery store and felt a bit unwell. I’ll be fine after resting.”

“Didn’t I tell you to call me when you go out? Are you sure you’re okay? Maybe we should get you to a hospital.” Ethan’s concern was evident in his eyes.

Olivia shook her head, blinking rapidly to hold back tears. She felt more fragile than ever. When her mother passed away and her father disappeared, she worked tirelessly to support Sophie. She didn’t even have time to cry, let alone wallow in self-pity. Those days were hard to look back on.

Ethan’s rare serious demeanor seemed to break through her defenses. “If it’s about Isabella Peterson and his brother's business troubles, I can help. I’ll do whatever it takes, for you.”

Olivia was touched by his offer. “Thank you, Ethan. I’m sure Isabella will handle things. He’s capable, and too proud to ask for help anyway.”

“Today…it’s because…I met my father,” Olivia admitted, biting her lip.

“Your father? The guy who drank, gambled, and abandoned you two?” Ethan’s fists clenched, seething with anger at the thought of James Cook.

Olivia’s voice was barely a whisper, “I found out he’s not my father.”

Ethan was stunned. Olivia recounted her encounter with James.

“Half a million? Consider it the last you’ll ever owe him. I’ll cover it,” Ethan said, trying to cheer her up with his over-the-top gestures.

Olivia couldn’t help but smile through her tears, remembering Ethan’s flamboyant antics. His light-heartedness was a balm to her wounded spirit.

While Ethan comforted Olivia, his mind was already scheming. James Cook needed to be dealt with, and the White family’s secrets needed unraveling.

Meanwhile, back at the White household, chaos was brewing.

Grace Martin was applying a face mask when her daughter, Mia White, stormed in, fuming. “I’m so mad I could scream!”

“What’s got you all worked up now? See Isabella and Olivia cozying up again? Or did you dig up some juicy gossip?” Grace asked, eyeing Mia.

“Why are you so obsessed with Isabella? There are plenty of great guys out there,” Grace chided. “Our family reaching for the stars with the Petersons was always a stretch. It’s no surprise they called off the engagement. Besides, that guy is ruthless. We can’t cross him.”

Mia’s face flushed with anger. “Mom, are you my real mother or not? Did you know Olivia is a White, and that’s why you’ve been so lenient?”

Grace sat up abruptly. “What did you say? Who’s a White?”

“Olivia!” Mia shouted, throwing a stack of papers onto the coffee table. “I hired a private investigator. Take a look!”

Grace snatched the papers, her eyes widening with each word. She slammed them down, cursing. “That old fool! I should have never let Sophia marry off to some backwater place. Should’ve dealt with her permanently.”

Grace had spent years guarding against Mr. White’s indiscretions, and yet here was another daughter to deal with.

“Congrats, Mom. You’ve got another daughter! Dad’s been fretting about our ties with the Petersons. Here’s your golden ticket! Bring Olivia into the fold, and bam! Instant family alliance!” Mia’s voice dripped with sarcasm.

“Nonsense!” Grace snapped, her usual composure slipping.

“You think Olivia will leave any room for you once she’s in? Mr. White will cling to her like she’s gold! If she wins over Isabella Peterson, even if she’s just a nobody’s child, your father will protect her. The only way is…”

“To get rid of her?” Mia mimed a throat-slitting motion. “Once she’s gone, Isabella’s eyes will wander. Men are fickle; they say pretty words, but they’re not loyal!”

Grace’s eyes were cold and calculating. “Leave it to me.”

“What are you two plotting?” Mr. White’s voice cut through their conspiracy from behind.

Both Mia and Grace were caught off guard.

Mia reached for the papers, but Mr. White grabbed them first.

As he read, a triumphant smile spread across his face. “Excellent work, Mia! This is exactly what we needed!”

Mia exchanged a bewildered look with her mother. Did he agree with getting rid of Olivia? That couldn’t be right, could it?

Mr. White clapped his hands together, “The Peterson Group is under Isabella now, and he’s a powerhouse. I’ve been searching for a connection, and here it is! Chloe, Mia, get ready. We’re holding a press conference to announce Olivia as my daughter!”

“What?” Grace stood up, her face a mask of disbelief. “I won’t allow it!”

Mr. White glanced at Grace’s masked face with disdain. “This isn’t up for debate. We’re at a critical juncture. If anyone tries to sabotage this, they’re out!”

Mia and Grace exchanged looks of defeat.

Mr. White left with the papers, eager to prepare for the press conference.

The next day, at the White family’s press event, Mr. White proudly declared he had found his long-lost daughter, the rising star Olivia Stewart. He announced a grand reception for her at the Golden City Hotel in a week.

The news caused a media frenzy. Critics of Olivia’s past went silent. The Whites might not rival the Petersons, but they were still influential. Being part of the White family was a step up from being an orphan, as society saw it.

Mr. White believed Olivia would be thrilled and grateful to join the family, so much so that he didn’t even consult her before the announcement. He even sent an invitation to Isabella Peterson.

But would Olivia accept?
