Olivia Stewart was practically begging, "I'll take care of my injuries, okay? Please, let's not make a big deal out of this. She's my sister, my only family! I don't want her to get hurt!"

"Family?" Isabella Peterson scoffed, cold glint in her eyes. "So you're protecting her because she's family, but what about me? Am I nothing to you, just because I'm not related by blood?"

"No, that's not it!" Olivia shook her head vigorously, a hint of sadness in her eyes.

Isabella grabbed Olivia's hand, thumping it against her firm chest, questioning painfully, "So she's your family, and you can protect her no matter what. But what am I to you?"

Seriously, was Isabella jealous of a girl?

And not just any jealousy, but full-on dramatic jealousy!

Olivia's face turned crimson, and she stammered softly, "You're... my man."

Man...

It was like being told you have a terminal illness and then finding out it was all a mistake.

Isabella's tall frame froze for a moment, disbelief in her eyes. "What did you just say? Say it again!"

Olivia looked up, suddenly raised on her tiptoes, and pressed a quick, shy kiss on Isabella's cheek, her eyes gleaming. "I said, you're my man! So, Isabella, don't be mad, okay?"

This little rascal!

A quick smile danced in Isabella's eyes. But in the next moment, though clearly pleased, she put on a proud face, chin lifted arrogantly.

Huh?

Olivia sighed, resigned, and stood on her tiptoes again, cheeks burning, to plant a quick peck on Isabella's lips.

So half-hearted?

Isabella raised an eyebrow, voice teasingly loud, "Olivia, is that how you show love to your man?"

"Oh, stop it!" Olivia couldn't help but playfully punch Isabella's solid chest with her small fists. "Uh..." She lowered her head, voice barely a whisper, "Michael Wright is still here!"

Isabella waved a hand dismissively, "Out! Get her out too!"

Olivia panicked, "Isabella, you!"

"I was originally going to have Michael dump her in the alligator pond!"

Olivia went silent, knowing this was Isabella's bottom line. She'd have to find another way to help Sophie Cook with her scars.

As Olivia pondered this, Isabella suddenly lifted her effortlessly.

"Wha—what are you doing?"

Panicked, Olivia clung to Isabella's neck, her arms wrapped tightly around him.

Isabella carried her bridal style, striding purposefully towards the door, his voice low and commanding, "Back to the room!"

Olivia sensed danger, struggling as she protested, "Isabella, I'm still injured!"

"Move any more, and I'll take you right here!"

"…"

"These little injuries, I've got ways to work around them!"

Olivia's mind filled with six imaginary dots. These little injuries...

Wasn't it this very injury that had him yelling at her and smashing things?

Soon, Olivia's voice echoed from the room, "Isabella, you jerk!"

"Hey, what are you doing? Get your hands off!"

"Isabella, you can't do this!"

"Isabella..."

Her voice carried through the open window, loud enough for the entire downstairs hall to hear. The staff went about their tasks, hiding smiles behind their hands.

Outside the hall, Sophie Cook bit her lip hard, her hands clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her palms.

She'd heard Isabella was back, and despite knowing she wasn't exactly on his good side, she couldn't resist dressing up and trying her luck.

Her face, now marred by scars, had been painstakingly covered with layers of foundation to mask the ugliness and restore her former beauty. She'd hoped to catch Isabella's eye again, but instead, she heard that!

After all the time under Henry Adams' "training," Sophie Cook knew all too well what was likely happening upstairs.

Olivia Stewart! So much for saying you care about me, so much for promising to help me once Isabella returned. It was all just a farce!

When it comes to acting, you're the master!

The thought that Olivia had probably told Isabella about her scars made Sophie feel like she was being eaten alive by a thousand ants. The pain was unbearable.

She wanted nothing more than to tear that hateful woman apart!

Just as Sophie raised her leg to storm off, a strong hand clamped down on her shoulder.

Sophie quickly masked her anger and turned, finding Michael Wright, Isabella's head of security. She forced a sweet smile, "Can I help you?"

Michael's face was like stone, "Miss Cook, come with me."

Sophie’s eyes lit up, "Was that Isabella's order?"

Michael nodded, expressionless, "Yes."

Where was Isabella taking her? A hotel? Or maybe...

Sophie's mind raced, excitement bubbling up inside her like a shaken soda can.

Michael said nothing more, leading Sophie out. Instead of driving across the bridge, they took a boat across the lake to the woods on the other side.

Sophie admired her reflection in the lake, like a graceful swan. With her makeup hiding the scars, she was still the beautiful, alluring Sophie Cook!

What guy doesn't cheat?

Isabella must still be thinking about her!

Back in the wine cellar, if Olivia hadn’t barged in, Isabella definitely would have...

Sophie's face turned a delicate shade of pink, even beneath the heavy makeup.

From the moment she saw Isabella step out of his luxury car outside the theater, she'd been captivated by this impossibly handsome, aloof, and wealthy man.

And he's loaded!

Sure, she'd flirted with big-shot celebrities like Henry Adams for the perks, but Isabella was the one who truly made her heart race!

Lost in her daydreams, Sophie didn't notice Michael's disdainful smirk.

Half an hour later, the boat docked.

Michael's voice was cold, "We're here. Off you go."

Sophie looked up, surprised to find herself in a forest. "Here?"

"Mmm." Michael's voice was flat.

Sophie's elegant brow furrowed slightly before she quickly brushed it off.

Isabella had her brought to the woods? Rich boys sure knew how to have fun!

Feeling giddy, Sophie hopped ashore. Michael turned the boat around and left.

Watching him leave only confirmed her suspicions—Isabella wanted to meet her alone here. As for what would happen next, oh, so scandalous!

Sophie's heart raced as she wobbled into the woods in her high heels.

There was a neat stone path through the forest, but not seeing Isabella, Sophie stubbornly decided he must be deeper in the woods, choosing to walk through the dense areas.

Soon enough, her ankle twisted, her dress tore, and her skin was scratched by thorns.

Panic set in, and Sophie called out, "Isabella!"

No reply. The forest was silent, no echo.

She shouted louder, "Isabella, where are you—"

Her answer was a flock of crows overhead, cawing eerily.

The forest was dimly lit, and Sophie finally realized something was wrong. Fear gripped her, and she yelled, "Help—help—"

Her cries echoed through the forest, but there was no response.

Sophie ran through the woods, her voice hoarse, shoes lost, feet bleeding. Her hair tangled with leaves, her dress in tatters, she was a mess.

By nightfall, she fainted in the forest, unable to find her way out.

A bodyguard appeared, checked her pulse, injected her with some nutrients, and dumped her by the roadside. After all, the boss said not to let her die, but also not to let her off easy!

The mountain night was cold, and Sophie soon awoke, shivering. She opened her eyes to find herself on the road outside the forest.

In the distance, headlights approached.

Hope surged through Sophie. She staggered to her feet, waving her arms, shouting, "Hey! Wait up! Driver, can you give me a ride?"

A white van screeched to a stop in front of her, headlights glaring.

Sophie shielded her eyes, avoiding the light. "Could you give me a lift, please?"

"Hmm, looks like she's got a good figure, and her voice ain't bad either. She's a catch!"

"Hahaha... Little lady, you sure you want to ride with us?"

The rowdy laughter from the van made Sophie squint. She blinked, realizing the van's windows revealed two young men, cigarettes dangling from their grins, looking cocky as ever.

She knew their type all too well from her time with Henry Adams.

But out here, in the middle of nowhere, who knew when the next car would pass by?

Steeling herself, Sophie put on a syrupy smile, "Gentlemen, would you be so kind to give me a ride?"

"Well, aren't you sweet! Come on over, I'll give you a hand! It's cold out here at night, how about a little warmth from us?"
