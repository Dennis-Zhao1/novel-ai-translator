Title: "It's My Turn to Say Goodbye"

In the dimly lit corner of a bustling bar, Lisa took a deep breath, her voice laced with bitterness as she confronted Ethan King. "You think I'm not clean enough for you? She's got her sugar daddy, Isabella Peterson, and she’s already cozying up to the superstar Ty Yi in the entertainment world. Do you really think she's any better than me?"

"Smack!"

Before Lisa could process what happened, Ethan's hand struck her face, sending her sprawling onto a nearby chair. She struggled to stand, her cheek stinging sharply, her head buzzing as she stared at Ethan in shock. "You hit me?"

Back in the day, Ethan had merely walked away in disappointment after catching her with some big shot at a hotel. Yet now, saying one bad thing about Olivia Stewart had earned her a slap.

"You have no right to compare yourself to Olivia Stewart!" Ethan declared, dismissing Lisa with a flick of his hand, refusing to even glance her way.

The first woman he ever hit was his first love. What had he ever seen in her? He had once been willing to do anything for her, almost losing himself in the process. What a fool he'd been!

"Olivia Stewart? You say her name so affectionately," Lisa taunted, tears glistening on her cheeks. Suddenly, she screamed, "Ethan King, what did Olivia give you? Whatever it is, I can give it to you too!"

Ignoring the public setting, she began tearing at her clothes. With a ripping sound, her dress split, revealing a tantalizing expanse of skin. She looked at Ethan defiantly, confident in the allure of her figure.

The room filled with jeers. Even in the noisy bar, her display was scandalous. Yet Ethan merely watched her with cool detachment, his mesmerizing eyes devoid of warmth.

Feeling defeated, Lisa grasped Ethan's hand, pressing it against her exposed skin. She was already humiliated; if she could win Ethan back, it would be worth it.

Despite her actions, Ethan pulled away in disgust, his eyes filled with scorn. "Enough, you crazy woman!"

A burly man from the crowd shouted, "Hey, girl, this guy's clearly not into women. Why waste your time? Come with me, I'll show you a good time!"

Lisa recoiled, suddenly aware of the predatory stares around her. Normally, she enjoyed such attention, but not in front of Ethan. She quickly covered herself, snapping, "Get lost! All of you!"

The man cursed and left, followed by the dispersing crowd.

Ethan watched impassively until Lisa sat back down. He smirked slightly, asking, "Finished your performance?"

His casual tone was as if he were inquiring about the weather. Lisa's face went pale. "Ethan, I wasn't acting. Maybe you think I'm beneath you now, but I really want you back! Leaving you was a mistake. Can we start over?"

"Alright," Ethan replied without hesitation. "Announce your retirement and come back to the farm with me."

"Uh, Ethan, I…" Lisa hesitated.

"Can't do it, can you?"

"No, it's not that, Ethan!" Lisa softened her tone. "I'm in the middle of a film. I can't just break the contract, right? Let me finish this one, and then I'll come to the farm. Okay?"

Ethan chuckled. "How many times have you said that? After I get the lead role, after I win the awards, after I go to the film festival…"

"No, this time I mean it, Ethan, believe me!" Lisa pleaded, gripping his arm, her voice filled with desperation.

Ethan looked at her, his smile faint, his gaze slightly unfocused from the alcohol. Lisa's heart skipped a beat; Ethan was an undeniably attractive man, far better than the rich old men she had been with. But he was just a farmer's son.

A flicker of disappointment crossed her eyes.

Though slightly drunk, Ethan was clear-headed, well aware of Lisa's manipulative ways. Her little tricks were transparent to him now, filling him with disappointment and scorn.

Ethan didn't pull away from Lisa, just watched her through eyes that were both alluring and distant.

Lisa's cheeks flushed as she leaned in, attempting to kiss Ethan's lips. "You're not worthy!" Ethan suddenly spoke, his voice soft but firm.

Lisa froze, her lips mere inches from his, unable to proceed. Ethan pushed her away, coldly asking, "Would you have tried to win me back if I hadn't fallen for Olivia Stewart?"

Lisa was taken aback, but quickly put on a hurt expression, clinging to Ethan's arm. "Ethan, don't be so heartless. Give me a chance to make it up to you."

"It's too late! From the moment I spent a whole night outside that hotel, only to see you walk out with an old man, laughing and chatting, it was too late!"

Ethan shook her off, his gaze icy and mocking. "Enough, Lisa. Drop the act. It's nauseating, not endearing."

Lisa's heart clenched. "Ethan, are you really that ruthless?"

"Let's be honest with each other."

Ethan picked up a glass of wine, unexpectedly pouring one for Lisa too. "If we met again, and I still loved you like before, would you leave with me?"

Lisa hesitated, quickly answering, "Yes, of course!"

"No, you wouldn't!" Ethan swirled his wine, his eyes fixed on the crimson liquid. "You'd act like a proud swan, your head held high."

"…"

"Lisa, you never loved me. You enjoyed having men chase you, willing to do anything for you. Now you want me back, not out of love, but because of your possessiveness!"

"You think men should revolve around you. You can't stand the idea of one becoming someone else's, especially me, who once was willing to do anything for you. You don't love me; you just can't bear to lose me because it hurts your pride!"

"No, it's not like that!" Lisa cried. "I really want you back. If I didn't love you, why would I swallow my pride to come to you?"

"Because you found out I love Olivia Stewart! The man you had wrapped around your finger suddenly loves your rival, your enemy. You can't stand it! You want me back just because you can't bear to see me with Olivia!"

Lisa was speechless, her face ashen. She had to admit, Ethan had hit the nail on the head. Everything he said was true.

Lisa opened her mouth but couldn't argue. 

Ethan, when not blinded by love, was astute and insightful. Realizing her petty tricks were exposed, any further words were unnecessary.

Staying would only bring further humiliation. Lisa grabbed her purse, turning to leave.

Ethan called out, "Where's your wheelchair?"

Lisa froze, unable to take another step.

Her injury had healed significantly. She had been advised to start moving around, but to gain sympathy, she hadn't left her wheelchair on set. Today, she had forgotten about it while following Ethan.

Ethan had the patience to wait until now to expose her!

"Ethan, let me explain, I just…" Lisa stammered.

"There's nothing more to say." Ethan stood, towering over Lisa. "Keep up your act, but if you ever harm Olivia Stewart, I'll deal with you myself!"

Lisa instinctively stepped back. During their time together, Ethan had been gentle and doting, never raising his voice. Yet now, as he glared down at her, she realized how wrong she had been to underestimate him.

"Lisa, remember, this time, I'm the one breaking up with you! Forever!"

With that, Ethan turned and strode out of the bar.
