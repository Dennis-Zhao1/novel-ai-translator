Olivia Stewart had always been a bit of a foodie, so when she heard there was a special meal, she eagerly picked up her fork. But the moment she glanced at the table, her enthusiasm wavered. "Lucas, what on earth are these dishes? They look so strange!" she exclaimed, bewildered.

Lucas Wright, the ever-dutiful butler, stepped forward, a bead of sweat forming on his brow. "These dishes are tailor-made for you and Mr. Peterson. The ones on the left are his, and the ones on the right are yours. A nutritionist specially designed this menu to benefit both of your health."

Olivia peered over at her side of the table, spotting a strange array of foods: ginger honey tea, hawthorn cake, black fungus and red date drink, lychee and date soup, and a couple of others she couldn't even name. Most of them seemed to be geared toward boosting energy and vitality.

Lucas had definitely outdone himself in the "thoughtful" department. Olivia pursed her lips, looking over at Isabella Peterson with a hint of distress. "How am I supposed to eat all this?"

"Since the nutritionist prepared it for you, you should eat it all. Every dish. You're so slim; you need to put on some weight. Now, start with the soup!"

"Hey, I'm not that skinny!" Olivia protested, but Lucas was already busy serving her a bowl of each dish, one after the other.

Isabella patiently held a bowl of soup in her hands, testing the temperature with a spoon before offering it to Olivia. Reluctantly, Olivia took a sip. But after just a few mouthfuls, she pushed the bowl away, whining, "This soup tastes weird. Can I skip it?"

"Don't like it? Try another!"

"But I don't like any of these! Isabella, can't I just have some spicy chicken wings, duck legs, or maybe some—"

Before she could finish listing her cravings, Isabella flicked her forehead gently. "Ouch!"

Isabella handed her another spoonful of soup, with a calm yet firm expression. "Finish these soups, and I'll have the kitchen make whatever you want."

"You think I'm that easy to fool?" Olivia groaned. "If I finish all these soups, I'll be too full to eat anything else!"

"Well then, fill up first, and we'll see."

"No way, Isabella!" Olivia pouted, shaking Isabella's arm in a playful attempt to win her over.

Isabella set the bowl down, seemingly enjoying Olivia's antics. Encouraged, Olivia amped up her charm offensive, but when she finally stopped to catch her breath, Isabella simply picked up the spoon again. "The soup's just right now. Drink up!"

All those sweet words had been for nothing, huh? Olivia fumed as she reluctantly took another sip, murmuring her frustrations under her breath.

She glared at Isabella, who was now smirking. "Were you planning to let me off the hook at all?"

"Do you really think I'd go easy when it comes to Mr. Peterson's well-being?"

"You..."

Olivia's eyes widened. Was this Isabella's way of saying she needed to work on her figure? She glanced down at herself, feeling a tad insulted. She wasn't lacking, was she?

"You think that's worth bragging about? Come back when you've got a figure like your PR Manager."

PR Manager? It took Olivia a second to remember the gym manager, Miss E, who was indeed more eye-catching. Since Olivia had signed a new contract, she hadn't been to the gym much. But Isabella still remembered her?

The thought made Olivia bristle. She snatched the soup bowl from Isabella's hands, gulping it down despite the heat. Isabella's eyes twinkled with amusement as he watched her determination.

After finishing the soup, Olivia felt stuffed to the brim. She burped ungracefully, glancing at the left side of the table where Isabella's dishes were laid. A mischievous idea sparked in her mind.

Olivia turned to Lucas with a sweet smile. "Lucas, could you tell me what dishes you've prepared for Isabella?"

Lucas's eyelid twitched, sensing something amiss, but he stepped forward, listing the dishes: "This is flower and kidney stew, sparrow corn porridge, red bean carp stew, tendon soup, yam beef brisket, and chive kidney stir-fry..."

As Isabella listened, his expression darkened. Olivia, barely containing her laughter, teased, "Sounds like a lot of dishes to boost one's...vitality."

"Bang!" Isabella pounded the table, glaring icily at Lucas. "What are you trying to imply?"

"Uh, I just thought Mr. Peterson deserved a bit of nourishment after all his hard work!"

"Are you saying I need it?"

Seeing Isabella's anger, Olivia quickly intervened. "Hey, why get mad at Lucas? Come on, they say it's good for you. Eat up!"

Olivia cheerfully served Isabella bowl after bowl, hoping he'd get a taste of the same medicine. She hadn't considered any deeper implications.

Isabella's intense gaze pinned her in place. "Do you think I need it too?"

"Of course, of course, the more the merrier. Here, drink up!" Olivia grinned, waiting to see him squirm.

Isabella took the bowl, his dark eyes never leaving hers. "Are you full?"

"Yeah, yeah, I'm stuffed. Now it's your turn!"

Olivia patted her full belly for emphasis. Isabella set the bowl down with a thud, suddenly scooping her up.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

"Since you're full, it's my turn now."

"But—"

Olivia's face turned crimson as she realized what he meant. She struggled in his arms, "Isabella, you can't! You haven't eaten yet! It's not healthy to skip meals! This soup is for you!"

Isabella paused, a teasing smile on his face. "Since you're so concerned about my health, I'll drink it. But remember, this benefits you too."

"Don't drink it!" Olivia protested, but Isabella had already downed the bowl.

Oh no! Too late to take it back now. Olivia felt like crying without tears.

Watching Olivia's futile struggles as Isabella carried her upstairs, Lucas could only shake his head, offering her a sympathetic glance. Sorry, Olivia, I'm afraid you're on your own here!

Days passed in a dreamy haze for Olivia, who found herself caught in Isabella's relentless attention. Finally, he seemed to ease up a bit, allowing her a semblance of normalcy in her routine, though she still woke up late each day.

Whenever she descended the stairs, the household staff would avert their eyes with knowing smiles at the signs of affection marking her skin. Embarrassed, Olivia would turn on Isabella, "This is all your fault!"

At that moment, Isabella lounged lazily on the couch, looking every inch a satisfied panther. He chuckled, beckoning her with a teasing grin, "Come here, sweetheart, I don't mind if you want to get even."

"You..."

Forget it. Getting worked up over a shameless guy like him was beneath her.

As Olivia turned to leave, Isabella hooked her leg with his foot, pulling her into his lap. "Sit."

With a yelp, Olivia landed unceremoniously on Isabella, making him wince. She blushed, quickly shifting away.

"Isabella, this is the living room!"

"Are you suggesting we move upstairs?"

"I'm warning you, not today!"

Seeing Olivia's serious expression, Isabella smirked silently, his face a mask of calm. "You're overthinking it."

"I'm overthinking it? I've suffered enough in your hands these past days!"

The servants stifled giggles from the corners of the room, making Olivia flush with embarrassment. She'd forgotten they were there.

Just then, Lucas entered with a group of medical experts in tow, filling the living room. It was time for a routine check-up? Had she really overthought everything?

Relieved, Olivia snuggled into Isabella's embrace, waiting quietly. These check-ups were such a hassle. She planned to ask Isabella to stop inviting these experts over once her health report came through. It was not only troublesome but expensive too!

Isabella held Olivia close with one arm, the other resting casually on the sofa. As the medical team assembled, his gaze swept over them, icy and detached.

The experts were bewildered under his scrutiny. Professor Hu, leading the group, stepped forward cautiously, "Is there a problem with Olivia's health?"

"Jinx! She's perfectly fine!" Isabella retorted sharply, earning a tug on his sleeve from Olivia. Could he be any more tactless?

The experts exchanged indignant glances. Who among them wasn't a leader in their field? Yet Mr. Peterson had them drop their critical research to attend to his girlfriend's minor issues, now speaking rudely to their leader. It was beyond insulting!

An elderly psychologist could no longer hold his tongue, "If Mr. Peterson no longer requires our services, perhaps we should take our leave."
