Chapter One: The Drama of First Kisses

"Wow, seriously?" Olivia Stewart's thoughts were racing, and she couldn't believe the situation she found herself in. She took a step back, waving her hands frantically. "No, no, no, I... I wasn’t trying to be bold. Maybe you should take the lead!"

"Alright!" Tian Yi snapped his fingers with a playful smirk, tilting Olivia's chin up. "Little Olivia, this time you better play along. If you refuse again, I won’t be so gentle next time. If my first kiss with a girl ends up looking forced, you’ll have to take responsibility!"

Olivia's cheeks turned crimson as she twisted a finger into her shirt, preparing herself mentally. "Okay, let's try again. I'll... do my best!"

"Great!"

With another snap of his fingers, Director Wang shouted through his megaphone, "Attention everyone! Prepare for the leading man's first kiss scene—action!"

The music began, and Olivia and Tian Yi quickly immersed themselves in their roles, their eyes locking passionately as sparks flew in the air.

“Bai Yike...” Tian Yi, as Gu Qianyi, whispered, drawing closer to Olivia. His lips hovered near hers with a deliberate, almost cinematic slowness, creating a breathtakingly beautiful moment that left everyone around holding their breath.

For Olivia, however, this romantic scene felt like sheer torture. She kept her eyes shut, fearing that if she opened them and saw anyone other than her beloved Isabella Peterson, she’d flee the set.

Even though Tian Yi was undeniably handsome, Olivia braced herself, her eyes squeezed shut, her eyelashes trembling slightly. Her portrayal of Bai Yike’s shy inner world was so spot-on that even Director Wang, watching from the sidelines, couldn't help but silently applaud.

After what felt like an eternity, Gu Qianyi's lips finally brushed against Bai Yike’s. A few more moments of on-screen chemistry, and the scene would wrap beautifully.

Everyone on set, from the actors to the crew, even the janitor, watched in rapt attention. Not all could receive a kiss from the leading man, but witnessing it live was the next best thing.

But just as the anticipation reached its peak, Olivia turned her face away at the last second.

"Cut!" Director Wang's voice boomed, filling the set with frustration. He marched over, placing himself between Olivia and Tian Yi, pointing accusingly at Olivia. "Olivia, what’s going on? It’s just acting! Haven't you ever been kissed before? If you can’t perform, you should leave!"

Mid-rant, Director Wang suddenly felt a chill as if he’d been silenced. He turned slowly to see Tian Yi gripping the back of his collar, his expression stormy.

Oh no! How could he forget, you don’t mess with the leading man’s good buddy! And clearly, Tian Yi had a soft spot for Olivia.

Director Wang, ever the quick thinker, immediately softened his approach, offering a sheepish smile. "Olivia, I apologize. I was just anxious and spoke out of turn. Please don’t take it to heart!"

Tian Yi released his grip, and Director Wang quickly retreated, still trying to save face. "Take a break, everyone. Gather your emotions and let’s try again when you’re ready."

Despite his retreat, the whispers among the crew persisted, especially from actresses who had hoped for the lead role. Their looks of disdain were unmistakable.

Olivia, head down, fiddled with her shirt, feeling the weight of their judgment.

Tian Yi stepped closer, gently taking her hand. His touch was warm and reassuring. Olivia glanced at his fingers, suddenly struck by their familiarity. "Your hand..."

Tian Yi raised an eyebrow. "What about it?"

Olivia hesitated, pulling her hand away with a shy smile. "Nothing, it just seems familiar!"

Tian Yi felt a slight jolt of panic. Had he been too obvious? Thankfully, Olivia never seemed to suspect anything unusual. "Are you thinking of your man? Are his hands as nice as mine?"

"Uh..." Olivia blushed, laughing awkwardly. "His hands aren’t as fair as yours, but they feel similar. Maybe you sophisticated guys all have nice hands. I’m probably overthinking it!"

"Is that why you’re having trouble with the scene? Because of him?"

"Yes." Olivia nodded earnestly.

Tian Yi’s lips curved upwards in a charming smile, his previously tense expression melting into genuine happiness.

Olivia assumed he was teasing her and looked away, a little embarrassed. "You don’t understand. My guy is kind of possessive! When he gets mad, he’s scary!"

Tian Yi’s smile froze momentarily. So, that’s what she’s worried about!

"But honestly, I can’t get past it myself," Olivia continued. "He's my only one, and I can’t handle being that close to another guy, even for a role. So, sorry!"

This girl, why didn’t she just say that from the start? Tian Yi’s mood soared, and he couldn’t help but play with a strand of Olivia’s hair.

Sweet thing, don’t apologize. You’re perfect, just like this.

Everyone watching the scene unfold was stunned by Tian Yi’s unexpected fondness for Olivia. Although they couldn’t hear the conversation, his delighted expression was enough to tell them Olivia must have said something that really pleased him.

No one could have guessed Olivia’s blunder would earn her anything other than Tian Yi’s disapproval, let alone his tender gesture of tucking her hair behind her ear!

What was her secret?

As the onlooking actresses whispered enviously, Lisa seethed with jealousy but maintained a composed facade, peeling grapes nonchalantly. "What’s there to envy? It’s just for the plot. Olivia's a newbie and clueless, so of course Tian Yi has to be patient and guide her. If any of you had snagged the lead, that treatment would be yours!"

Lisa’s words instantly made Olivia the target of their resentment. The looks turned even more hostile.

Sophie Cook, standing behind Lisa, felt a spark of inspiration. She quickly grabbed a mango juice and made her way to the set, calling out sweetly, "Sister, are you thirsty? Would you like some juice?"

The private moment shattered, Tian Yi’s expression immediately turned cold, his eyes distant as if Sophie’s presence was beneath his notice.

Olivia noted his demeanor, feeling a pang of sympathy for Sophie. Despite her flawless appearance, sweet voice, and charming presence, which should be every man’s dream, Tian Yi remained unmoved.

With a sigh, Olivia took the juice from Sophie, "Thanks!"

"No need to thank me, we’re sisters after all," Sophie replied, giving Olivia a quick wink.

Remembering Sophie’s request to help her get closer to Tian Yi, Olivia nodded, reassuring her with a quick glance before taking a sip of the juice.

"Aren’t you worried about getting burned again?" Tian Yi’s teasing voice interrupted before she could take a sip.

"Uh..." Olivia set the straw down, coughing slightly to mask her embarrassment. She looked at Tian Yi, smiling sheepishly. "That was ages ago. It was just an accident. Sophie’s just a sometimes-spoiled kid!"

"Don’t defend me, sister. I was wrong back then!"

Sophie became teary-eyed, her voice trembling as she looked at Tian Yi, tears spilling from her eyes in an almost irresistible plea for sympathy.

But Tian Yi was the exception.

Realizing her tears had no effect, Sophie stubbornly wiped them away, her voice tinged with defiance. "I’ve made mistakes, but I’ve changed. If you don’t believe me, there’s nothing I can do. Apart from my sister, I don’t need anyone’s forgiveness. Believe what you want!"

Tian Yi's lips curved slightly, his gaze returning to Olivia with a playful glint. "Your sister is quite the actress!"

And so, amidst the drama both on and off-screen, Olivia navigated her way through a world where acting wasn’t just for the cameras.
