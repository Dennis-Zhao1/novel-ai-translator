Olivia Stewart was at it again—completely sloshed. Isabella Peterson's face turned as dark as a thunderstorm. Her sharp gaze swept over the room, catching the servants trying to hide their smirks. "Who let her drink so much? Everyone, out!"

"Hey, you crazy fool, have you gotten even more handsome?" Olivia giggled, throwing herself onto Isabella, her hands reaching up to touch his face. "Are you okay? Did that jerk Isabella Peterson give you a hard time?"

Even drunk, she was worried about that guy!

Isabella coldly peeled Olivia’s hands off, but she just slithered back like a snake, wrapping around him.

"Crazy, get me out of here! You have no idea how awful Isabella Peterson is! Oh, and," Olivia stumbled over her words, counting on her fingers, "I still owe him one hundred ninety-nine kisses! Haha, plus the one I borrowed, that's a whole two hundred!"

Isabella’s eyes darkened.

This little creature had her debts all figured out; she wasn’t as drunk as she seemed!

Olivia sprawled in Isabella’s arms, her rosy face rubbing against his shirt, mumbling to herself, "You don’t know, he’s always so mean to me. He even made me cry today..."

Isabella's chest tightened. So that’s why she cried today!

In an instant, the frustration that had been weighing him down all afternoon vanished. He wrapped his arm around Olivia’s waist, letting her rest comfortably against him. With a tender touch, he brushed his chin across her hair, his voice soft with unexpected affection, "Little thing, why drink so much when you can’t handle it?"

"I signed the papers. I sold myself. If I didn’t drink, how could I face you, Isabella Peterson..."

Isabella felt a sharp pang in his heart, like someone had yanked it hard, leaving him breathless. Olivia, is staying by my side really so unbearable for you?

Before he could dwell on it, Olivia wobbled out of his arms, spinning in circles and singing nonsense. "Just because I looked at you once in the crowd, I can’t forget your face..."

Soon, she clung to a pillar nearby, cursing, "Isabella Peterson, I despise you!"

"Isabella Peterson, I’ll destroy you for the universe!"

"Isabella Peterson, Isabella Peterson..."

Eventually, Olivia quieted down, snuggling drowsily into Isabella’s arms, only a soft, affectionate murmur left as she drifted off.

Isabella leaned down, planting a gentle kiss on her forehead. "Sweetheart, why numb yourself with alcohol? I would never force you. If you can remember who you are, I’ll let bygones be bygones."

The next morning.

"Ah—!"

Olivia’s scream shattered the morning calm.

"What the heck, Isabella Peterson, why are you in my bed?"

"Olivia, take a good look. Whose bed is this, really?"

Olivia glanced around, taking in the sleek, luxurious black and white decor—completely different from her pink princess-themed room. Her eyes widened in shock. "Isabella Peterson, how did I end up in your bed?"

Then she looked down at her pajamas.

"What are you looking at? I changed your clothes, and yeah, I gave you a bath too!"

"Get lost!"

Olivia hurled a pillow at Isabella, who caught it effortlessly. "If you’ve got the guts, throw yourself at me too. I promise I won’t hurt you!"

Olivia grabbed anything within reach to throw, cursing as she went, "Isabella Peterson, you arrogant jerk, you took advantage of me. You’re despicable, shameless. I curse you to never stand tall in front of any beautiful woman!"

"And what about you?" Isabella suddenly chimed in, his tone teasing. "If your curse works, you’ll regret it."

"You! Didn’t you say you wouldn’t force women?"

"I didn’t force you. You climbed into my bed yourself."

"I... Nonsense! Isabella Peterson, it’s not fair to blame me after everything!"

"Olivia, did you really drink yourself into oblivion last night? Who was causing a ruckus until midnight? Who wouldn’t let go of me? Who insisted I tell her the story of the big bad wolf and the little white rabbit?"

"I... You... You can tell stories?"

"I can act them out!"

Olivia deflated, hanging her head. After a long pause, she looked up, her eyes red.

"Isabella Peterson, I’ve fulfilled the contract. Can I leave now?"

Isabella froze, then yanked open the bedside drawer, tossing a contract at her. "Olivia, you’re so naive. Read it carefully. The agreement says a year, not a night!"

"I’ve told you a million times, I’m Olivia Stewart, not Olivia!"

Olivia pointed at the signature labeled "Olivia" on the contract. "What’s this got to do with me?"

"So what?" Isabella’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "You deliberately signed as Olivia yesterday just to mess with me, didn’t you?"

"All's fair in love and war. You tricked me too. It’s mutual!"

"Olivia, look closely at the contract and your signature."

Olivia’s small frame trembled. "Isabella, stop yelling at me! Why are you so mean?"

Oh, so her yelling wasn’t mean, but his was? Isabella’s dark eyes glared, but remembering how upset she was last night, he reined in his temper.

Olivia scrutinized the signature for a while. "I see nothing wrong, except that this contract shouldn’t exist."

"The signature’s yours, right?"

Olivia hesitated. "Yeah."

Isabella coolly pulled out another document from the drawer, tossing it in front of her.

This time, Olivia spotted the issue. The signatures on both contracts, the name "Olivia," were identical, yet one was dated five years ago. It was the one Isabella had thrown at her earlier, and she hadn’t even recognized it!

Olivia’s mouth hung open in shock, speechless.

Isabella crossed his arms, a smug look on his face, as if to say, "You’ve got no choice but to believe it."

"I’ve had a handwriting expert verify it. The writing is undeniably yours. Which means you, Olivia Stewart, are Olivia, my woman! I can have you whenever I want, however I want!"

"No, that’s impossible! I have no memory of this. How can it be..."

"You’ve got five minutes to process this." Isabella waved dismissively. "I won’t hold your past foolishness against you. Just remember to listen to me from now on. Don’t even think about running again, or I’ll break your legs!"

Olivia looked up suddenly. "Isabella, your forgery skills are impressive. You’ve even fooled the experts!"

Isabella’s face turned a deep shade of green.

He’d laid out the evidence, and she still didn’t believe him! Accusing him of forgery, no less!

"Olivia, have you read too many novels? Is your brain full of holes?"

"My brain isn’t full of holes, but yours must have a bump! Isabella, you’re a rich guy, right? You can have any woman you want. Why go to such lengths to make my life miserable? I just ruined your engagement ceremony, but I’ve apologized. I didn’t mean to! I was aiming for my ex’s wedding!"

"You’ve got an ex besides that effeminate guy? Tell me about it!"

Olivia’s eyes dimmed. "There’s nothing to say. He’s just a jerk. He cheated on me for a fancy city address and married my former best friend."

"Olivia, Olivia!" Isabella poked her forehead. "How could you have such poor taste? Don’t you think sticking with me is a safer bet? Smart move realizing that before it’s too late. I’m giving you a chance to redeem yourself!"

This egotistical maniac!

"Isabella," Olivia bit her lip, "I just want to know, can you let me go?"

"Hmm?"

Olivia gathered her courage. "Even if I really am this Olivia, whatever happened before, I don’t remember. I don’t love you anymore, so why force it?"

A vein throbbed at Isabella’s temple. "Say that again!"

Olivia took a deep breath, raising her voice, "Even if I’m Olivia, I don’t love you anymore. What’s the point of tying me down?"

"Bang!"

Isabella slammed Olivia onto the bed, her head hitting the bedpost with a thud.

His eyes flared with pain, but he held back from checking on her, instead reaching for her clothes with a sharp rip.

"If you can’t have me willingly, you’ll take me by force?" Olivia looked at Isabella, her eyes brimming with tears yet stubbornly refusing to fall. "Isabella, you’re no better than this! No wonder Olivia left you back then!"

Isabella’s eyes bulged like saucers, dark rage swirling in them. He raised his hand high.

Olivia closed her eyes, accepting her fate, turning her face away.

"Bang!"

Suddenly, Isabella punched the bedpost instead, quickly retreating from Olivia as if she were something infectious, his face twisted with disgust. "You’re not Olivia. I wouldn’t touch a heartless, filthy woman like you. Get out!"

Olivia scrambled up, clutching her shirt, and rushed out, flinging the door open.

Lucas Wright stood there, his usual smile replaced with a grave expression. "Olivia, your words were too harsh. How could you hurt the young master like that?"

"Does that mean I should just let myself be hurt? I’m only trying to protect myself!"

With that, Olivia clutched her chest and ran, colliding with a maid who was carrying clothes. The clothes scattered across the floor.

"I’m so sorry!" The maid apologized, bending to pick up the clothes. "Olivia, these got dirty. I’ll get you a new set right away."

"No need."

Olivia grabbed the clothes. She just wanted to change and leave, not staying a moment longer.

"These aren’t mine, are they?" Although the style was similar, the quality was much better.

"No, Olivia. Your clothes were beyond repair, so the young master had us make a new set."

Olivia blushed with embarrassment. What did "beyond repair" even mean? Probably shredded to pieces by Isabella, right?

Last night was quite the scene...
