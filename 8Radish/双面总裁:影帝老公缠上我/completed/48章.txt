Chapter 1: The Midnight Escape

"Let me hide here!"

"Ethan, you crazy..."

Ethan King clamped his hand over Olivia Stewart's mouth, his other hand pinning her wrists as he leaned in, pressing most of his weight against her. Don't be fooled by his usual flamboyant demeanor; when push came to shove, Ethan was surprisingly strong. Olivia couldn't move an inch.

This scene felt oddly familiar. Olivia's mind flashed back to an incident in the library with Isabella Peterson, where things almost got out of hand. Her cheeks flushed with heat. Seriously, Olivia? Now's not the time for that!

"Mmph, mmph!" Olivia's eyes shot daggers at Ethan, signaling her protest.

"Shh, Olivia, don't make a sound," Ethan whispered, his voice barely audible as he leaned close to her ear. "Someone's after me. I need to hide here for a bit."

A grown man sneaking into a woman's bed to escape pursuers in the dead of night—really? Olivia's mind was a flurry of question marks, but she stilled her movements. Her curiosity piqued.

What kind of trouble had Ethan gotten himself into? Who was chasing him in the middle of the night?

Sensing Olivia's compliance, Ethan slowly released her mouth, his hand naturally sliding to a less appropriate place.

"You crazy idiot!" Olivia muttered, swatting his hand away.

Ethan realized where his hand had landed and quickly retracted it. "Sorry, sorry!"

The room fell silent, filled only with the sound of their breathing. Ethan's breath grew heavier, his skin radiating heat.

"Are you okay, Ethan?" Olivia asked softly, inching away from him. "You're trembling."

It's not from fear... Ethan's muscles tensed, but he couldn't explain without risking being kicked out of bed.

"Who's after you? Someone you pissed off?"

"No, it's not like that—"

Before Ethan could explain, a loud knock on the door interrupted them, growing more insistent by the second.

Ethan leaned in, whispering urgently in Olivia's ear, "You handle it."

Olivia scratched her ear, tickled by Ethan's breath, and poked her head out from under the covers. "Who is it?" she called out shakily.

"Open up!" came a gruff voice from the other side.

Olivia mustered her courage, raising her voice. "Who are you, and how did you get into my place? It's the middle of the night, and I'm a single woman here. Why should I open the door for you?"

There was a pause, then the voice softened slightly. "Miss, we're sorry to disturb you. We're looking for someone. Please open the door so we can check."

"What are you checking for? There's no one here but me, not even a fly!"

"Ma'am, please cooperate, or we'll have to force our way in."

Olivia glanced at Ethan, who gestured silently for her to let him escape through the window. She nodded, watching him carefully climb onto the windowsill before making her way to the door.

They both overlooked one crucial detail: they were on the fifth floor.

Olivia cracked the door open, peeking out to see two burly men in black suits standing there, faces stern and expressionless.

"How did you get in?" she demanded.

"We picked the lock," one of them replied nonchalantly, as if breaking in was a commendable feat.

"This is trespassing! I'll call the cops!"

"Following orders, ma'am. Please let us do our job."

Olivia rolled her eyes, opening the door slightly wider. "Look, see? Just me."

One of the men glanced at Olivia, reaching to push the door further open.

Olivia blocked him with her body. "What do you think you're doing?"

"Sorry, we need to search the place."

"Search for what? With that creepy stare of yours?"

The man flushed with embarrassment. Olivia seized the moment, quickly shutting the door. "Wait outside while I change!"

Sitting on her bed, Olivia stalled, pretending to change clothes as the men grew impatient, knocking repeatedly. Each time, she assured them she was almost ready until ten minutes had passed without her opening the door.

The longer she delayed, the more suspicious the men became until they finally crashed through the door.

Startled, Olivia jumped up, clutching a pillow to her chest. It wasn't much of a weapon, but it gave her some comfort.

"What are you doing? Two grown men barging into a woman's room at this hour—shame on you!" she scolded, glaring at the intruders.

The two men exchanged embarrassed glances but remained focused on their task, turning on the room's lights and beginning a thorough search.

Olivia's room was small, and it was clear there was no one else inside. Yet the men were meticulous, checking every nook and cranny.

One of them lifted Olivia's blanket, then got on all fours, shining a flashlight under the bed. The other opened her closet, rummaging through her few clothes.

Olivia watched them with a mix of irritation and amusement. These two hulking figures looked utterly ridiculous.

In less than two minutes, they had searched every corner and found nothing. Disappointed, the men exchanged looks.

"Done searching? Then get out and let me sleep!" Olivia snapped.

The men conferred quietly. "We've checked every room. Could the intel be wrong?"

"The empty room was his; he must have heard us picking the lock. He couldn't have left through the door. He must be hiding somewhere."

One of the men scanned the room again, his gaze landing on the open window.

Olivia's heart skipped a beat, her expression briefly betraying her panic.

The shorter man noticed and rushed to the window, peering outside.

"Fifth floor—no one would jump out a window unless they're insane," the taller man scoffed.

Olivia felt a surge of dread. Ethan, please be okay. Please don't do anything reckless.

She rushed to the window, pushing past the man to look outside. The world was shrouded in darkness, the ground below obscured by tree shadows under the streetlights.

Did Ethan jump in desperation? Would he?

Olivia's face turned pale, her body trembling uncontrollably. She covered her mouth with her hand, stifling a sob that sounded more like an animal's wail.

The taller man grabbed her by the throat. "Did he jump? Did you see it?"

Olivia nodded, then shook her head, then nodded again, tears welling up.

"You crazy woman! How could you let him jump from the fifth floor?"

The man tightened his grip, pushing Olivia halfway out the window.

"Don't hurt her!"

A familiar voice called out from the wind.

"Ethan!" Olivia turned her head, straining to see.

The taller man released Olivia, pulling Ethan in from the window's ledge.

Ethan had been hiding on the air conditioning unit outside. Trust him to come up with something like that!

Once inside, Ethan steadied himself and slapped the taller man across the face with a loud smack.

"Sir..." the man said, holding his cheek, his demeanor respectful.

The shorter man stood at attention, "Good evening, sir!"

Olivia gaped at the three of them, her eyes darting between Ethan and the men. Weren't they here to capture him? Why were they calling him "sir"?

After a moment, the taller man spoke, "Sir, please come with us."

Ethan sighed heavily, casting Olivia an apologetic look. "Can I have a moment to speak with her alone?"

"Sorry, sir, but you'll have to speak now."

They weren't about to let Ethan out of their sight again. No way were they losing him a second time.

Ethan shrugged, turning to Olivia with a tenderness she hadn't seen before. Her heart raced in confusion. "Ethan, what is going on?"

Ethan gently ruffled her hair, smiling softly. "It's complicated to explain now. I'll tell you everything when I can. Olivia, I have to leave for a while. Take care of yourself. The title and keys to this apartment are in my nightstand. Keep them safe for me. I'll be back."

Title? Weren't they just roommates sharing rent? Ethan owned the place all along?

He was a "sir," the owner of the apartment, yet he'd been living like a regular guy, working odd jobs with her...

How much about Ethan King did she not know?
