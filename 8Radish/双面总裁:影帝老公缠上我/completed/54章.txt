Isabella Peterson didn't even think twice. She spun around and sprinted toward the commotion outside the restaurant.

Underneath the suspended flower terrace, a small crowd of house staff had gathered, craning their necks to look upward. One of them gasped, “It’s Olivia Stewart!”

Isabella dashed over, her heart leaping into her throat. There was Olivia, teetering on the edge of the rose-covered roof, inching her way further out like a tightrope walker without a net.

"Olivia Stewart, get down here!" Isabella shouted, her voice a mix of sternness and panic.

Olivia, looking down at her with a curious, almost childish gaze, replied, “I just got up here! Why should I come down?”

“What on earth are you doing up there?” Isabella demanded, exasperation creeping into her voice.

“I thought the flowers were super pretty, so I climbed up to take a closer look and maybe pick one. Come on, Isabella, I just wanted a flower! Why are you being so stingy?”

Isabella shot a glare at the servant who had shouted about a potential suicide, making them shrink back immediately.

"Olivia, it's dangerous up there. Please come down," Isabella tried again, her tone softening with genuine concern.

“No way!” Olivia declared, plopping down and dangling her legs over the edge, seemingly oblivious to the danger.

The staff below couldn’t help but stifle their giggles while Isabella’s face darkened with frustration. “Get down here this instant or I’ll tan your hide!” she threatened.

“You think I’m dumb?” Olivia replied, her eyes still a little unfocused from the wine she’d had earlier. “If I fall, I’ll be the one who ‘flowers’ all over the pavement!”

Isabella groaned inwardly. This girl!

“Just wait there!” Isabella said, beginning to climb up after her.

“Don’t!” Olivia shouted, suddenly panicked. In her haste to get up, she slipped, skidding dangerously close to the edge of the glass roof.

A collective gasp rose from the onlookers.

Olivia clung to the edge, half her body hanging over nothing but air. She looked down and felt sobriety crash over her like a cold wave. “Isabella, help!” she cried out, her voice breaking.

“Hold on tight, Olivia! I’m coming!” Isabella reassured her, quickly ascending the nearby spiral staircase that wound around the glass structure.

“Sir, don’t go up there!” one of the staff called, fear lacing their voice.

“Sir, we’re getting the safety gear. Just wait a little longer!”

“It’s too dangerous, sir. Let us handle it!”

But Isabella wasn’t listening. The glass roof, though beautiful, was a treacherous expanse with no railings and a slick surface that could send anyone tumbling.

“I said, quiet!” Isabella barked, stepping onto the glass without hesitation.

Olivia was small and not very strong, especially not after a few drinks. If they waited for safety gear, she’d likely have slipped by then.

“Olivia, don’t be scared!” Isabella called out, his voice carrying a strange calm that seemed to reach Olivia even from a distance.

She quieted, focusing solely on Isabella as he moved toward her with careful, measured steps. Her eyes, though still filled with tears, seemed to trust him implicitly.

Isabella reached her quickly, offering his hand just as Olivia’s grip began to falter.

With difficulty, Olivia freed one hand and grasped Isabella’s, feeling a surge of warmth and safety through the contact. For a moment, it felt like as long as he was there, nothing could go wrong.

“Olivia, hold onto my hand and slowly let go with the other.”

Following his instructions, Olivia did as told, relying entirely on Isabella to keep her from falling. It was a precarious position—one misstep, and they’d both be over the edge.

All eyes below watched in tense silence, afraid to even breathe.

“Now, shift your weight to your left foot, just like that,” Isabella coached, guiding her through each motion until she was safely away from the edge.

But then Olivia’s foot slipped again, sending her sliding toward the perilous drop. The sudden pull threw Isabella off balance, and they both tumbled toward the edge.

Isabella could have let go to save himself, but instead, he held on tighter.

In a matter of moments, they were both at the brink. Olivia dangled precariously, while Isabella clung to the glass, his arm straining to keep her aloft.

"Don't let go, sweetheart!" Isabella urged, his jaw clenched with effort.

“I won’t, Isabella! I promise!” Olivia replied, her voice shaky but resolved. She knew she had to help him help her.

With a Herculean effort, Isabella began pulling her back up, his muscles straining visibly under the effort. Sweat poured down his brow as he hoisted Olivia back to the safety of the glass.

Finally, when all seemed lost, Isabella managed to lift her back to the roof’s edge.

Exhausted, both of them were at their limits. Olivia, too shaken to move, relied entirely on Isabella’s strength.

In a bold move, Isabella leaned down, offering his leg as a step. “Step on my foot, Olivia.”

She did as she was told, finding stability enough to climb back to a safer position.

Neither gave up, despite the struggle. When they finally made eye contact, they couldn’t help but smile, relief washing over them like sunlight breaking through clouds.

On the ground, Lucas Wright was orchestrating the setup of a safety cushion, looking up to see them smiling at each other. “For crying out loud, can’t they save the flirting for later?” he muttered, exasperated.

“Isabella, we’re ready down here! Jump down when you’re ready!” Lucas shouted.

Isabella looked at Olivia, a teasing glint in his eyes. “You up for a jump?”

Olivia hesitated, then grinned. “Only if you jump with me.”

He gave her a devilish smirk, “How about we roll back instead?”

“Roll? Sounds like you’re insulting me!” Olivia retorted.

“Nope, just a roll,” Isabella clarified, winking.

With a sudden twist and a pull, he maneuvered her onto the glass roof, holding her tight as they rolled back inside the terrace to safety.

Olivia felt the world spin, but before she knew it, Isabella’s lips were on hers, locking her in an embrace she wasn’t eager to break.

“Mmm, mmm,” she mumbled, half-heartedly pushing against his chest before giving up and surrendering to the moment.

The two remained locked in their own world atop the glass rooftop, surrounded by the heady scent of blooming roses and the cool night air.

Below, the staff watched the scene unfold, stunned into silence.

Eventually, Olivia felt the need for air and Isabella finally released her, his gaze full of warmth.

“You okay, sweetheart?” he asked, his voice soft and husky.

Olivia pushed him away, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. Through the now-crimson roses, she saw the crowd below and nearly exploded with mortification.

“Isabella! Everyone’s watching us, and you didn’t even care?” she scolded, flustered.

“Heh," he chuckled, nudging her nose with his. "So, you’re saying it’s okay when no one’s looking?”

“I-I didn’t say that! We’re still up here, and you’re making a scene!”

Isabella stood, helping Olivia to her feet. It was then she realized they had rolled back into the safety of the terrace, right next to the staircase.

“Oh, we’re safe now? No wonder you had time for…that!”

“What do you mean by ‘that’?” Isabella teased.

Olivia’s face turned red again as she tugged him toward the stairs. “Come on, let’s get down. Haven’t you had enough excitement for one day?”

Isabella watched her grab his hand, his heart swelling with contentment.

They made their way down to the ground, greeted by Lucas and the relieved staff.

“Sorry for worrying everyone!” Olivia said with a bright smile, nodding at the gathered crowd.

“Smack!”

“Ow!” Olivia yelped, feeling a stinging slap on her behind. She spun around to face Isabella, who stood there looking entirely too pleased with himself.

“Isabella! What was that for?” she demanded, her face a fiery shade of red.

And thus, the night ended with a blend of relief, laughter, and just a hint of embarrassment.
