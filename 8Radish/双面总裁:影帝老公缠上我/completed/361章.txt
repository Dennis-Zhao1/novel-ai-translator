It was one of those days where everything seemed to be spiraling out of control. Isabella Peterson was in the middle of a crisis, but she was determined to keep things together. After carrying Olivia Stewart back to the lounge and making sure little Coco was alright, she gave Coco a reassuring pat. "You take care of your mom, okay?" she said. Coco nodded seriously, "You go catch the bad guy, I'll be here for mom!"

Isabella left the room with purpose but was interrupted by a nurse rushing towards her. The nurse, breathless and apologetic, stammered, "Ms. Peterson, I'm so sorry! We haven't found anything yet..."

Isabella waved her off, not wanting to hear any more bad news. "It's alright. Please inform the lab to expedite the paternity test for Olivia and Tommy's blood samples. I'll handle the blood issue myself."

With that, Isabella pulled out her phone, speaking in a hushed tone, "David, get Alexander here ASAP. And make it quick."

Alexander Peterson, who had been kept in a secret underground chamber he had once built, had no idea that his own fortress would become his prison. Overhearing Isabella and David's conversation, Alexander scoffed, "You think I'll help save his son? Not a chance!"

David, not in the mood for pleasantries, knocked Alexander out with a swift chop to the neck and carried him to the lab.

Isabella didn't waste any time. She grabbed a doctor and ordered, "Draw his blood for the kid!" The doctor hesitated, but the urgency in Isabella's voice left no room for questions. He quickly set about taking Alexander's blood.

Despite Isabella's insistence, the blood tests came back negative. Alexander's blood type didn't match Tommy's needs. Isabella's frustration turned to anger, and she punched Alexander hard enough to wake him from his stupor.

"Whose child is Tommy, really?" she demanded as Alexander slowly came to.

Alexander chuckled, his smile sinister and mocking, "He's not yours, that's for sure. Didn't you already know that?"

"But he's supposed to be yours! Why doesn't his blood type match yours?" Isabella shouted, landing another punch.

Alexander laughed bitterly, "You raised my son all these years. How does it feel?"

Frustrated and with time running out, Isabella stormed out. The hospital staff, who had been whispering and watching, scattered to avoid getting caught up in the chaos.

Meanwhile, a bold doctor couldn't resist sharing the unfolding drama on the hospital's website. Although he knew it might get him into trouble, he felt compelled to expose Alexander's cruelty. Within moments, the post went viral, and a call for blood donations for Tommy spread across the city.

Back in the hospital, the atmosphere was tense. They had received a call that the blood supply from out of town was delayed due to a traffic accident. With the blood bank depleted, all they could do was wait and hope.

Standing outside the emergency room, Isabella was at a loss. Despite everything she had done, her efforts seemed futile. The thought of losing Tommy, and what it would do to Olivia, weighed heavily on her.

Suddenly, the emergency room doors burst open. The nurse who had been coordinating the blood drive stumbled in, breathless and disheveled. "We found someoneâ€”a match!" she gasped.

Isabella's heart leaped. There was still hope.
