He Got Kissed by Surprise

Tian Yi’s eyes turned icy cold as he abruptly pulled away, pushing Olivia Stewart back with a force that made her stagger. He had a severe case of germaphobia, and the mere thought of Olivia throwing herself into Ethan King’s embrace earlier made his skin crawl!

He couldn’t believe this audacious little thing had the nerve to turn around and show disdain toward him! Was it because Ethan King was back that she’d lost all sense?

Olivia, regaining her balance from Tian Yi’s shove, opened her eyes to see his face, etched with disdain and contempt. Strangely, instead of feeling wronged, she felt an odd sense of relief. Maybe now the heartthrob wouldn’t insist on filming that kiss scene?

Her relieved expression didn’t escape Tian Yi’s notice. His eyes narrowed dangerously, a blue flame flickering in their depths, both cold and captivating. With a swift move, he stepped forward, grasped Olivia’s chin, and descended upon her lips in a fierce kiss.

There was no warning, no romantic buildup, no fancy technique—just a straightforward, intense kiss that left Olivia both stunned and swaying backward, unable to stop herself from retreating.

But in the next moment, an athletic, well-toned leg swept out to stop her from falling, while a strong hand steadied her waist, its warmth seeping through her thin clothing.

Olivia’s heart raced, her face flushed with burning heat. She wanted to resist, but her lips and tongue wouldn’t cooperate. She tried to speak, only to have every breath stolen by his overpowering kiss!

Her small fists pushed against Tian Yi’s chest as she reluctantly endured his fervent assault. Their poses, entwined and passionate, were as intimate as swans weaving their necks together in candlelight. The temperature around them seemed to rise, almost audibly crackling with the sparks flying between Olivia and Tian Yi.

The onlookers were utterly flabbergasted! The aloof and cool Tian Yi, rumored to have a preference for men, was passionately kissing Olivia Stewart off-screen! It was simply unbelievable!

Director Wang, eyes bulging like a goldfish, discreetly motioned to the cameraman: “Capture this! Quick, this is a once-in-a-lifetime scene!”

Ethan King stood on the sidelines, his fists clenched tightly, veins bulging on his hands. He had heard rumors of the chaos in the entertainment industry, and now he was seeing it firsthand! Olivia Stewart, is this the life you’ve chosen after leaving with Isabella Peterson? I should never have let you make such a reckless choice!

Lisa, a few steps away from Ethan King, watched him silently. Seeing the pain in his expression, she gripped the armrests of her wheelchair tightly, her perfectly made-up face showing a flicker of complicated emotions.

Since when did you start ignoring me, Ethan? Could it be that you’ve also fallen for Olivia? The thought twisted Lisa’s face momentarily, a flash of hatred in her eyes. But as an experienced actress, she was adept at changing her expression in an instant.

Lisa glanced nonchalantly at the passionate embrace between Tian Yi and Olivia, smiling slightly as if nothing was amiss, and remarked, “Wow, they’re really into it! Could it be that their on-screen romance has turned real?”

Ethan King turned his head, casting a cold glance at Lisa. She took the opportunity to wheel herself over to him, feigning innocence with a sweet smile, “Ethan, it’s been a while! How did you know I was filming with this crew? Did you come to visit me?”

Ethan looked down at Lisa in her wheelchair and was tempted to ask what had happened to her. Still, seeing her fake smile, he couldn’t muster any concern, only a deep-seated disgust.

“I came to visit, but not you,” he said coldly, turning to leave.

Lisa grabbed his hand, her face stripped of its false cheer, leaving only sadness and loneliness. She looked up at him, pleading softly, “Ethan, don’t do this to me, please? I know you’re still mad at me! But look at how injured I am now—don’t you feel any pity?”

“When I cared, you didn’t. Whatever you’ve become, you chose this path yourself!” Ethan replied, shaking off her hand and heading toward the set, only to be stopped by security.

On set, Tian Yi and Olivia were still wrapped up in each other. Olivia’s face was flushed, and she was on the verge of suffocation, limp against Tian Yi’s arm, utterly yielding. 

This little dummy still hadn’t learned to breathe correctly while kissing! Tian Yi continued to draw out Olivia’s breath, only to relent momentarily before diving back in.

Olivia felt like a suffocating goldfish, desperately drawing thin oxygen from Tian Yi’s mouth. The overwhelming sensation of suppression followed by a sudden release was dizzying, like fireworks exploding in her mind, vivid and dazzling!

For a brief moment, she was lost, enchanted. But as she finally caught a breath of fresh air, clarity returned to her mind.

Oh no! This is Tian Yi, not Isabella Peterson—how could I let myself get lost like this! A surge of guilt and betrayal washed over her, and Olivia began to push Tian Yi away with her fists once more.

This little thing dared to be distracted while he was kissing her! Tian Yi’s blue eyes narrowed, glinting with coldness as he bit down on Olivia’s lip.

“Ouch!” 

Olivia winced in pain, her bright eyes welling with tears. This jerk! She shoved Tian Yi away, glaring at him with an innocent, aggrieved look that unexpectedly tugged at his heartstrings.

Tian Yi’s gaze softened as it fell on Olivia’s face—her eyebrows furrowed, long lashes damp and trembling like butterfly wings kissed by morning dew. Her small nose and mouth scrunched up, her lips red and swollen, with a small cut at the corner oozing a crimson thread.

He had really gone too far this time! Yet, she looked irresistibly enticing. Tian Yi swallowed hard, a flash of regret and tenderness crossing his eyes.

Olivia Stewart, if I could do it over, I’d be gentle, so gentle.

He reached out, wanting to pat her head. But Olivia turned away, dodging his hand, quickly wiping her lips with the back of her hand before she turned and ran off without looking back.

Tian Yi watched her retreat, stunned for a moment before realizing—had he just been rejected?

Damn it!

Director Wang rushed over, camera in hand, grinning from ear to ear. “Tian Yi, this scene doesn’t need a retake. The passion and fireworks are much more captivating than the usual romantic stuff—want to review the footage?”

“Get lost!” Tian Yi snapped, leaving the bewildered director in his dust as he strode off.

Ah, the perks of being a superstar—having the luxury to be arrogant!

Director Wang turned his frustration on the rest of the crew. “What are you all staring at? Get back to work! This scene’s done. Let’s move on to the next, except for the leads!”

After Tian Yi left, he scanned the vast set but saw no sign of Olivia. Where did that little thing run off to? Could she have snuck off to meet that pretty boy?

The thought darkened Tian Yi’s handsome face like a thundercloud.

No way would the proud young master search the whole set personally, so he kicked his assistant, Amy Green, into action.

Amy immediately called Michael Wright, instructing him to keep an eye on things outside and ensure Ethan King didn’t whisk Olivia away. Meanwhile, she searched the set, praying silently: Olivia, please don’t get caught with that guy, or the boss will kill me!

Tian Yi lounged under a tree on his exclusive recliner, exuding an intimidating aura that screamed “stay away,” his face as sour as if someone owed him billions.

Ten minutes later, a sweaty Amy Green returned, breathless. “Boss, I-I couldn’t find Olivia!”

Tian Yi’s foot twitched.

Amy quickly dodged, hurriedly adding, “But she didn’t go to see that pretty boy either!”

Tian Yi’s leg gracefully arched through the air, landing on the ground as if he was casually stretching.

“You’re sure?”

“Absolutely sure! I’ve had Michael Wright watching closely—one hundred percent sure!”

Amy nodded vigorously, wiping a nervous sweat from her forehead.
