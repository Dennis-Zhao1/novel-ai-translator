The helicopter touched down gently in front of the grand castle, and Olivia Stewart quickly let go of Isabella Peterson's waist as soon as they landed. Isabella felt a pang of disappointment and instinctively tightened her grip around Olivia’s waist. Unprepared, Olivia stumbled into Isabella's chest with a thud.

"Oof!" Olivia yelped, rubbing her nose with tears welling up. "Isabella, is your chest made of iron or something?"

Isabella's eyes danced with mischief. "I’ve got other parts just as hard. Wanna try?"

Olivia simply rolled her eyes and walked off. Isabella stood there, baffled. Well, that was quick. Her mood changed faster than flipping a page.

Isabella considered running after her but decided against it. A grown man chasing after a woman? No way. He stood there, arms crossed, his handsome face clouded with brooding.

Olivia turned around suddenly. "Where’s Sophie Cook?"

Isabella’s expression darkened further. "You didn’t think after all her stunts, I’d bring her here, did you?"

Olivia spun on her heel to leave. Isabella grabbed her arm. "Where are you going?"

Olivia bit her lip. "I want to see her. Isabella, can I have half a day off?"

Just moments ago, they were so close. Now, suddenly, he's just Isabella to her again? What’s up with this woman?

Isabella’s brows knitted together, his frustration palpable. "Olivia, are you really mad at me over Sophie Cook? The whole world sees she set you up with those scandalous photos, and you’re the only one who doesn’t!"

"Yeah, I’m that naive! Isabella, I just want to check on her, then I’ll be right back to fulfill our agreement."

"You..."

Isabella turned away in exasperation. He thought flying the helicopter to the rescue, revealing Olivia’s true identity publicly, was apology enough. Clearly not.

Lucas Wright, who had been observing the whole scene, sighed and walked over. "Olivia, when Sophie Cook fell, she landed on a bunch of people. She's only got some minor injuries and is back at her apartment."

"Thank you, Lucas."

"Thank the boss. I just did what he asked."

So, she had misunderstood him?

Olivia looked at Isabella’s retreating back, biting her lip, saying nothing. During her darkest hour, she had wished Isabella would swoop in and save her, and he did. But once everything settled, she remembered how he had once been so adamant about pushing her away.

Flipping emotions so easily felt a bit dramatic, but everyone wants more, don’t they? If she threw herself into this again, only to be discarded when Isabella got bored, what then?

Falling for him felt like losing somehow.

Olivia sniffed, tears dampening her long lashes. She hadn't cried when the paparazzi tore her apart, but now she was. How pathetic!

Lucas sighed, "Olivia, the boss knows he wronged you. He’s just too proud to admit it..."

"Enough!"

Isabella's voice cut through the air like a knife. Lucas stopped, turning to find Isabella in casual clothes, looking thoroughly displeased.

Lucas quickly stepped aside. "Sir!"

Isabella walked past him, pausing beside Olivia. "Aren’t you going to see Sophie Cook?"

Olivia looked up, surprised. Was he offering to go with her?

Isabella strode off with his long legs, and Olivia scurried to catch up. Lucas decided it was best not to intervene, letting them sort it out themselves.

Isabella didn’t even bring his bodyguards, choosing to drive himself. Olivia sneaked a glance at his tense profile and decided to explain. "I just want to make sure she’s okay emotionally. Oh, and thanks for everything."

Isabella’s expression tightened even more, and he floored the gas, grumbling internally. Olivia, you fool. I want more than just your presence. I want your heart. Why are you being so polite with me?

When they reached Sophie Cook’s apartment, Olivia got out, and Isabella stayed in the car.

"I’ll be quick," Olivia said, bending down to peek at him.

"You’ve got five minutes!"

Once Olivia was inside, Isabella called his assistant, his face a picture of menace. "Get me all the dirt on Sophie Cook framing Olivia, and I want it in three days!"

Inside the apartment, Sophie Cook was tearing the place apart, venting her frustration. "I’ll destroy you! I’ll—"

"Sophie!" Olivia hurried over, grabbing Sophie from behind. "What are you doing?"

Sophie had a knife in hand, ready to slash at a doll, but froze at Olivia’s voice. As Olivia hugged her, Sophie’s lips curled into a sinister smile. She spun around, pretending to accidentally scrape the knife across Olivia’s arm, then cried out, "Sis—I’m sorry, I messed up again!"

Olivia bit back the pain, soothing Sophie. "It’s over now. Isabella announced those photos were fake. The paparazzi won’t dare to write nonsense anymore. Let it go, Sophie. You’re young. Leave the past behind and move forward."

Sophie clung to Olivia, her eyes filled with malice. Who cared about that? She was seething that Olivia wasn’t ruined and that Isabella turned out to be the legendary entertainment mogul. Olivia, how did you get so lucky?

Though furious inside, Sophie masked it well, nodding obediently under Olivia’s comforting words. "Okay."

Olivia relaxed a bit, unaware of Sophie’s true feelings. She thought of Sophie as naive, not realizing Sophie played the family bond perfectly, selling her act convincingly.

Sophie pulled away, noticing Olivia’s bleeding arm, crying out, "Sis!"

Olivia winced at her grip but stayed composed. "It’s nothing, just a scratch."

"Sis, I’m sorry, it’s all my fault! How could I be so stupid?"

Sophie held Olivia's arm, filled with remorse, tears streaming down.

"Alright, Sophie, stop crying. Go get the first aid kit."

"Oh!" Sophie snapped out of it, rushing to grab the kit.

Returning, Sophie volunteered to help. "Sis, let me bandage you!"

Olivia smiled. "Sure."

Watching Sophie’s clumsy but earnest efforts, Olivia felt a warmth spread through her. Despite the poking and prodding, each sting was sweet.

Growing up, her parents always favored Sophie, and taking care of her was Olivia’s duty, ingrained since childhood. Deep down, Olivia longed for a typical sisterly relationship—arguments and makeups, sharing toys and beds.

Now, it seemed Sophie had matured.

After bandaging, Olivia adjusted her sleeve, feeling apologetic. "Sophie, I have to go. Isabella still misunderstands you, so I can’t bring you to the castle yet. Take care, alright?"

Hmph! Misunderstands? More like you don’t want me near him, afraid I’d steal your man!

Sophie hid her resentment, smiling sweetly. "Okay, sis. I understand if he’s upset. I’ll prove myself to him!"

"Good!"

Olivia blushed at the term "brother-in-law," unaware of Sophie’s reluctance in using it.

Leaving Sophie’s, Olivia saw Isabella impatiently leaning against the car, checking his watch.

She approached, looking down. "Isabella!"

He turned, pulling her close against the car door. "I hate that name."

Olivia lowered her gaze, knowing it would annoy him but unable to resist.

He was always questioning her ties with Ethan King, always ready to dismiss her.

Isabella, seeing her disinterested, grew angrier, lifting her chin. "What do you call me?"

Unfazed, Olivia replied, "Second Young Master."

Isabella blinked, his expression shifting. It had been ages since anyone called him that outside the family estate. Second Young Master? How odd it sounded!
