Olivia Stewart never expected this kind of betrayal. Her sister Sophie Cook and her boyfriend, Isabella Peterson? Seriously? That's a whole new level of messed up.

Olivia had always been the kind of sister who put Sophie first, just like their parents had drilled into her since they were kids. But this? This was a different ball game altogether.

She should have seen it coming when Isabella, with her sharp tongue, once jokingly asked, "What if your sister takes a liking to your man?" At the time, Olivia had laughed it off. But now, as she stood there with clenched fists and a bitter smile, it was clear that the joke had turned into a harsh reality.

Olivia wanted to walk away, but her feet seemed to have a mind of their own, pulling her toward the scene of the crime. She was tired of feeling sorry for herself. She wanted to see their faces when she showed up.

As she approached, Isabella's voice, thick with intoxication, reached her ears. "Olivia Stewart..."

Even though his gaze was fixated on Sophie's blushing face, Isabella was calling out her name. Was he so drunk that he'd confused Sophie for her?

Olivia's heart twisted painfully at the thought, but she pushed forward, hoping against hope that he was just too drunk to realize what he was doing.

But then, Isabella leaned in, aiming to kiss Sophie, and Olivia's heart shattered into a thousand pieces.

No! Her mind screamed, but no sound came out. She was frozen, a silent witness to her own heartbreak.

Just as their lips were about to meet, Isabella suddenly pulled back, his voice hoarse as he muttered, "No, I can't do this."

Sophie opened her eyes, tears streaming down her face, and Isabella panicked, trying to wipe them away. "I'm sorry, Olivia Stewart. It's my fault. I forgot the doctor said you have issues. Olivia, I think about you every day, and it's driving me insane!"

Olivia felt like she'd been hit by a lightning bolt. Did he really just say he was losing his mind over her? Could it be that all this time, his hesitations weren't about rejection but about her own issues?

A sense of elation bubbled up inside her, but before she could process it, Sophie made her move. She wrapped her arms around Isabella's neck, boldly declaring, "It's okay, I want this! I've liked you for so long, Isabella!"

Isabella's eyes shone with hope. "Really, Olivia? You're okay with this?"

And that was it. Olivia snapped. "Isabella Peterson, you have no shame!"

She stormed forward, yanking Sophie away from Isabella, delivering a slap to each of their cheeks.

Sophie stood there, stunned, clutching her face, while Isabella's drunken stupor seemed to clear up a bit. He looked between the sisters, realization dawning on his face. "Shit! I've been duped!"

Pointing at Sophie, he turned to Olivia with a pleading look. "Olivia, let me explain..."

"Save it," Olivia shot back, her voice icy. "We'll deal with this later."

Isabella wisely backed off, leaving Olivia to face her sister.

Sophie tried to play the victim, tears welling in her eyes, but Olivia wasn't having it. "Stop with the tears, Sophie."

"But, Olivia, I just..."

"Enough!" Olivia cut her off, her voice a mix of pain and disappointment. "My whole life, I've given you everything you wanted, thinking it would make them love me too. But look at what you've done."

Sophie looked down, guilt written all over her face.

Olivia continued, her voice softening. "If you truly love Isabella, I would have let you have him, but only if he loved you back."

Sophie's face lit up, but Olivia wasn't done. "But he doesn't. He never did."

Before Sophie could say another word, Isabella stepped forward, his voice firm. "Olivia, I don't want her. I never did. I just got confused because of the damn drinks. I only want you."

Sophie sat on the floor, stunned and defeated, as Olivia turned to her, kneeling down. "Did you hear what he said, Sophie? It's time to let go."

Sophie looked up, her eyes filled with bitterness and anger, but Olivia didn't flinch. She finally knew where she stood, and she was ready to fight for herself.
