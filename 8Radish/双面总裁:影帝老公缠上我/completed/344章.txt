Title: The Family Dinner Drama

---

So, here's the deal. Olivia Stewart's got twins, and Tulip can't help but wonder why he got shipped off to that darn boarding school instead of chilling with them. Those buried feelings of anger and jealousy? Yeah, they're bubbling up like a shaken soda can.

During dinner, Olivia's not-so-happy vibes made Tulip feel like she was mad at him for not being the perfect older brother who knows when to give up his seat. So, he stands up, playing the good kid, and says, "Hey, if my sister wants this spot, it's all hers!"

Olivia looks between Tulip and the tearful Gogo, and decides to diffuse the situation by asking Tulip to move. Little did she know, her words only confirmed Tulip's suspicions about her favoritism.

After the switch, Tulip's silence is louder than a drum solo. Meanwhile, Gogo's still pouting because Olivia didn't give her the attention she wanted. Koko's sitting quietly next to Isabella Peterson, but let's be real, if his sister's upset, he's not exactly having a blast either.

What was supposed to be a fun family dinner turns into the most awkward meal ever. Afterward, Gogo drags Koko upstairs, still mad at her big brother and her mom. Her pout could hold a gallon of oil, clearly saying, "Apologize, or I'm not talking to you!"

Olivia sighs, "I've spoiled her rotten!" Isabella gently reassures her, "Kids are young, they'll learn."

Olivia apologizes to Tulip, "Sorry about Gogo's tantrum. Spend more time with her and she'll be stuck to you like glue."

Tulip's internal monologue? "Who wants that?" But outwardly, he's all smiles and understanding, "No worries, I'll always give way to her."

With that, Tulip excuses himself politely and heads upstairs, leaving Olivia with a cotton ball feeling in her chest, like she just can't get comfortable. She turns to Isabella, worried, "Maybe it's because I've been away from Tulip for so long that he's distant?"

Isabella rubs her head, "You've been gone for years. It's normal for him to feel a bit estranged."

Olivia frowns, "But it feels like he's holding some grudge."

Isabella soothingly orders, "Stop overthinking! Take a walk with me, it'll help."

Olivia chuckles, recalling when Isabella whisked her away to this very spot. Back then, she'd never have guessed they'd be walking hand-in-hand here someday. Isabella teases, "No faith in yourself?"

"I was trying to escape you every minute," Olivia retorts.

Isabella smirks, "But I knew you'd never get away."

Olivia playfully punches Isabella's arm, "You're such a bossy guy!"

As they stroll, the mood heats up until a phone rings, cutting through the tension like a cold shower.

Olivia's trying to signal Isabella to pick up. Finally, Isabella answers, "What?" with enough annoyance to fuel a bonfire.

It’s Ethan King. He hesitates, then says, "I sent over two important guests you forgot. One's a chef Olivia loves."

Chef, huh? Isabella hangs up, thinking, "If they make Olivia's favorite soup, that's fine."

Olivia hears Ethan's voice and asks, "What's up?"

Isabella explains, "Ethan mentioned sending two guests, one being a chef you like."

Olivia's heart skips. Could it be...? Nah, impossible. She quizzes Isabella, "You know what 'old Tai Shan' means, right?"

Isabella's clueless, so Olivia giggles, "It's your in-laws! Ethan meant to say your father-in-law and mother-in-law."

Isabella pats Olivia's head, "Of course I know that!" He worries, "Your parents?"

Olivia guesses, "I loved a chef's soup there, but never saw them. Could it be...?"

Isabella reassures her, "Don't stress. We'll find out soon."

Sure enough, the next day Olivia’s parents arrive. She thought they'd rush over, but it wasn't until evening they asked to see her.
