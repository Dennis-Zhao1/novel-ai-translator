“Show me the money!” Olivia Stewart declared, crossing her arms defiantly. Her eyes locked onto Isabella Peterson, who sat across from her with a smug grin spreading across his face.

Isabella, the ever-dashing heir with a reputation for both charm and arrogance, spooned another bite of food and held it towards Olivia. “Eat,” he commanded, his tone a mix of teasing and insistence.

Olivia turned her head away, sticking to her guns. “No way!” she shot back, her stubborn streak shining through.

“Seriously? Look at you! You’re all skin and bones. How’s that supposed to feel good in my arms?” Isabella smirked, clearly enjoying the banter.

“What the heck?” Olivia exclaimed, her mouth dropping open in disbelief.

Isabella continued, unfazed. “And you keep fainting all the time. It’s a total mood killer!”

Olivia’s pride stung at his words, but she wasn’t backing down. She glared at him, “Why don’t you just get a blow-up doll? A few puffs of air, and boom! No fainting, guaranteed.”

Isabella’s jaw clenched for a moment, his patience wearing thin. “Olivia Stewart!”

Seeing that he was genuinely upset, Olivia’s defiance wavered. She softened her tone, “Okay, fine. I’ll eat.”

She grabbed the bowl from Isabella’s hands and, in a few swift bites, finished off the remaining food. The last thing she needed was for him to storm off and find someone else to entertain him. Just the thought made her stomach churn.

Feeling a bit more energized after the meal, Olivia triumphantly flipped the empty bowl in front of Isabella. “See? All done!”

Isabella didn’t respond, simply picking up another plate of food for himself. He ate quickly, yet with a grace that made the whole act look like a dining scene out of a high-end film.

Watching him, Olivia couldn’t help but admire his elegance. It was something so innate, it seemed to seep from his very bones.

“Like what you see?” Isabella asked, catching her off guard.

“Huh?” Olivia blinked, realizing she’d been staring.

“If you want to look, just go ahead. No need to be sneaky about it,” Isabella teased, already unbuttoning his shirt with a playful smirk. “I’m not shy. Want a full view?”

“Stop, stop!” Olivia squealed, covering her eyes. “I’ve got something serious to talk about!”

Isabella paused, a teasing grin still lingering. “Go on, then.”

Recovering her composure, Olivia reached out her hand. “I need money.”

Isabella raised an eyebrow, amused. “Asking for money right after I’ve just ‘taken care’ of you? Isn’t that a bit suggestive?”

Olivia’s face turned crimson. “You’re impossible! It’s not like that. I need a lot of money to break my contract with Century Films. The penalty’s going to be huge.”

“Breaking your contract?” Isabella’s brows knitted together in confusion. “Why?”

Olivia looked him straight in the eye. “Because my man… got jealous.”

Isabella’s expression softened, a pleased smirk tugging at his lips. “So…”

“So, to keep you happy, I’ve decided to quit acting. To heck with that heartthrob actor title!”

Isabella’s face darkened, contemplating her words. After a moment, he simply stated, “No.”

“No?” Olivia echoed, baffled. “You’re okay with me acting all buddy-buddy with other guys on set?”

Isabella’s fist hit the table. “It’s just acting. Why should I care?”

“Meaning, if I have to get cozy with some actor for a scene, you won’t get mad?”

Isabella’s eyes flashed. “Which eye of yours saw me getting jealous?”

Olivia wisely chose not to challenge his blatant denial. Instead, she beamed, pulling his hand towards hers. “Great! Sign here, no take-backs!”

Isabella eyed her with mock disdain as she pressed their thumbs together in a makeshift contract. “Immature,” he muttered.

But Olivia was thrilled. She flopped onto the bed, rolling around gleefully. She couldn’t wait to dive back into the world of acting without worrying about Isabella’s jealousy. After all, he’d promised, right?

Of course, promises about jealousy were easier said than kept. As the day wore on, Isabella watched Olivia’s carefree antics with a knowing smile. He tackled her playfully, pulling her into his arms. “Feeling strong now, huh?”

“Hey, Isabella, no roughhousing after meals!” Olivia protested, trying to wriggle free. But it was too late—he had her right where he wanted.

The two of them spent the entire day cozied up in the room, their playful bickering and laughter echoing through the house. Meanwhile, the internet buzzed with rumors about Olivia’s on-screen chemistry with her co-star, overshadowing the release of their upcoming movie, “Send an Angel to Love You.”

Later that evening, while Isabella worked in his study, Olivia lounged on the couch, scrolling through gossip sites. She was curious to see if today’s filming had made the headlines.

When she saw the photos, her heart skipped a beat. The internet was flooded with images of her and her co-star, looking intimate and close. Fans were going wild, especially over one shot that looked like a near-kiss.

Panicking, Olivia quickly flipped her tablet down, sneaking a glance at Isabella. He was engrossed in his work, seemingly oblivious.

Relieved, Olivia sighed. Thank goodness Isabella wasn’t into gossip; otherwise, this could get awkward.

What she didn’t know was that Isabella was very much aware of those photos. In fact, he was the one managing what made it to the public. If he didn’t want her pictures circulating, they wouldn’t stand a chance.

Watching her from the corner of his eye, Isabella chuckled to himself. He knew he’d let her think she’d fooled him, just this once. But in truth, he was crafting a surprise, something special that only he could make for her.

As filming for “Send an Angel to Love You” kicked off in the charming town of Peach Blossom Village, Olivia was swept away by the beauty of the place. It was everything Isabella had promised and more—a testament to his incredible attention to detail.

But on her first day of filming, Olivia stumbled through her scenes, her inexperience showing. Yet, despite the chaos, she was determined to make this new venture a success, all while juggling the ever-complicated world of her relationship with Isabella.
