Encounter with the Mysterious Men

Isabella Peterson closed the study door behind her with a determined click, her voice firm and cold, "What's going on? Spill it."

The voice on the other end of the line was tense: "We've tracked down the whereabouts of the child who was sold years ago. The kid has a congenital heart condition and is currently at the Golden City Orphanage."

A wave of realization washed over Isabella. She, too, had struggled with a heart condition as a child. This had to be her son. Genetics, huh?

"But..." The voice hesitated.

Isabella felt her heart drop. Could it be...

"When we reached the orphanage, we found out the child had just been adopted. All the adopter's information was fake, and we can't trace them!"

Isabella's fingers clenched into a fist, her knuckles turning pale. How could this be such a coincidence? Had Alexander Peterson already caught wind of her every move?

Hanging up the phone, Isabella's dark eyes flickered with thought. Alexander Peterson had been laying the groundwork at Group Peterson for five years, and their father favored him deeply. This wasn't her turf; she couldn't make reckless moves without consequences. Returning home now would be a disgraceful retreat.

In the past, Isabella would have fought back fiercely. But now, with Olivia Stewart at her side, her top priority was Olivia's safety. Besides, if the child was indeed in Alexander's hands, she had to tread even more carefully.

Isabella drummed her long fingers on the desk, lost in thought. Outside, Olivia had been eavesdropping at the door, but she couldn't make sense of the muffled conversation. Her brows furrowed in frustration as she glared at the closed door. What was Isabella hiding? Did he have a secret child or something? The thought made her chuckle at her own wild imagination. She knew Isabella too well for that.

"Olivia!" The sudden voice behind her made Olivia jump. She turned to see Lucas Wright and sighed in relief, grumbling, "Lucas, don't sneak up on me like that!"

"Sorry, Olivia," Lucas said, glancing at the study door. It dawned on Olivia that she'd been caught eavesdropping. She awkwardly rubbed her hands together. "Uh, it was cold, so I brought Isabella a coat!"

But where was the coat? Lucas didn't call her bluff, instead handing her a large bag of medicines. "Here, Olivia. I got the meds you asked for. Is this enough?"

Olivia quickly took the bag, grateful for the distraction. "Yeah, that's plenty!"

Once Olivia was gone, Lucas knocked on the study door, his usually cheerful face now serious. Whatever had driven Isabella to handle this in the study, avoiding Olivia, was major.

Inside, Isabella wasted no time. "Tomorrow, I'll distract the old man and Alexander. You get Olivia out of here. Take her home and have David Wright ensure her safety."

Lucas looked at Isabella, noting the grim determination on his face. "Are you ready to face Alexander head-on?"

"Not yet," Isabella replied, ruffling her hair in frustration. "The kid was taken. I suspect Alexander's behind it."

Breakfast the next day was tense. Isabella told Olivia about the plan to send her away, but she surprised him by staying calm. "Are you sure?" she asked quietly.

Isabella had prepared a whole speech to convince her, but her calm demeanor threw him off. He simply nodded. "Yeah."

Olivia stuffed a piece of toast in her mouth, feigning nonchalance. "When do I leave?"

"ASAP," Isabella replied, hiding his worry.

"Okay," Olivia said, finishing her milk. "Let's get it over with. I can continue my research back home, and I'll keep you updated."

Isabella looked at her, a hint of displeasure in his eyes. She was too composed. "Don't you even want to know why?"

Olivia met his gaze with a trusting smile. "You've got your reasons. I don't understand your battle with Alexander and can't help much here. I'd just be in the way."

Her insight and understanding touched Isabella. He took her hand gently. "I'm sorry for this."

This once stoic and sharp-tongued man showed a rare tenderness. Olivia felt a warm, bittersweet sensation. She met his gaze earnestly. "No matter what, I'm here for you. Just promise me you'll stay safe."

Isabella pulled her into a hug, resting his chin on her head. "I will."

"And no flirting with other women!" she added, teasingly.

Isabella laughed, playfully tapping her nose. "Anything else?"

Olivia thought for a moment, shaking her head. "Nope, that's it for now. I'll call you if I think of more."

Isabella chuckled, holding her close. Their light-hearted banter eased the sadness of their impending separation.

Lucas had arranged everything outside, and Isabella held Olivia's hand as they walked down the tree-lined path. Their fingers intertwined, they walked in silence, letting the reality of their parting sink in.

"Take care of yourself," Isabella reminded her.

"I will."

"And think of me."

"I will."

"No letting other guys near you, not even David."

"I... okay."

"Call me every day. I need to check in on you."

Isabella's endless instructions made Olivia roll her eyes, his protectiveness both endearing and exasperating.

Despite their playful exchange, Isabella remained vigilant, scanning their surroundings. The old man had gone to great lengths to bring Olivia here, and Isabella feared a trap might be in store.

As they reached the edge of the estate, Isabella's senses went on high alert. He pulled Olivia close, shielding her as a group of black-clad men emerged from the woods, blocking their path.

The men bowed respectfully. "Second Young Master."

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile. "Still calling me that?"

His icy tone cut through the air like shards of glass. The leader of the group bowed again. "The eldest master requests that you and Olivia come back."

Isabella's gaze was deadly. "I'll count to three. If you're still in my way, you're my enemy."

The men hesitated, exchanging uneasy glances, but none moved.

Isabella tightened his grip on Olivia, his fist clenching in readiness. "Bring it on."

Olivia stayed nestled against him, determined not to be a burden. She whispered, "I'm ready, Isabella. Don't worry about me, just take them down."

Isabella kissed her ear, murmuring, "Good girl."

Olivia grinned mischievously. "Let's go all out. You hit them low, I'll go for their eyes!"

Her fierce spirit made Isabella laugh softly. She was a little spitfire, and he loved her for it.

With a nod, Isabella steeled himself, guiding Olivia forward. The tension crackled in the air as they approached the men, ready for whatever came next.
