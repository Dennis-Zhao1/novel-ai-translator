Title: Not Fit to Be His Mother

---

That night, he was utterly wasted, spilling out words like an overflowing fountain. It was then I realized — he was with me not out of love, but necessity. I looked like the woman he truly adored.

As Asha recounted this, she shot a glance at Olivia Stewart, causing Isabella Peterson's face to visibly darken. Olivia gently squeezed Isabella's hand, trying to dispel the storm brewing in her heart.

Asha, oblivious to their exchange, continued, "He confessed that the woman had betrayed him, and in his unrequited love, he turned to me. But to him, this child was nothing but a joke."

Asha bit her lip hard, tears welling in her eyes. After a long pause, she took a deep breath and went on, "After that night, he never returned to the club. My friends urged me to abort the child. In our line of work, getting emotionally involved is the last thing you want — it's only a burden."

Asha's laugh was bitter. "But I wasn't willing to give up. If I was going down, I wanted to know why. So, I contacted him, determined to keep the baby and prove a point. To my surprise, Master Chase just laughed, telling me to go ahead. He said I was just as disgusting as the woman who betrayed him."

Olivia squeezed Isabella's hand tighter. Isabella returned the gesture, the warmth of their palms sharing a silent reassurance. They exchanged a look, filled with trust and determination, and managed a small smile.

Asha noticed their interaction, whispering, "You two are truly blessed."

Olivia pressed her lips together, knowing that happiness was something they had fought for, side by side. She turned to Asha, "Please, continue. I need to know everything."

"Once I was pregnant, the club let me go. Master Chase refused to take responsibility, and I was stubborn enough not to abort the baby. So, I rented a small apartment, waiting for the child to be born and to prove something to him."

Asha's smile was one of resignation. "I was so naive back then. What could having his child prove to a man whose heart was never with me?"

"For over half a year, I had no job, no income. By the time I was in the hospital giving birth, I had spent every last cent of my savings. Life was incredibly hard during that time."

"I thought having the baby would change everything. I didn't expect luxury, just a place by his side. But fate had other plans. The baby was diagnosed with a severe congenital heart defect. Without immediate treatment, he wouldn't survive long."

"Master Chase was all about appearances. How could I present such a child to him? He'd never acknowledged the baby, and showing up with him would only result in humiliation and neglect."

"So, one night, when no one was around, I left the baby at the doorstep of Angel's Haven Orphanage. I hid in the shadows until I saw the director pick him up, then I walked away..."

Asha covered her face with her hands, tears slipping through her fingers. "I didn’t want to abandon him! I really had no other choice."

Her voice was filled with agony and regret. Olivia silently handed her a tissue, gently patting her back. "As a mother myself, I understand. No mother would willingly abandon her child unless she had no other choice."

Asha sniffed, taking a while to calm down. "I moved to another city to start over, thinking that was the end of my ill-fated connection with Master Chase. But years later, I returned to Golden City and couldn't resist checking on the child at the orphanage. That's when I ran into him. He told me he would send the child to the Peterson Group, but only if I left and never revealed the child’s true parentage."

"For the child’s better future, I agreed and left Golden City that day. To cut off any attachment, I never followed any news related to the Peterson Group. Until I saw that plea for a blood donation, I had no idea what life had been like for Tom."

"I failed Tom. I'm not fit to be his mother. I..."

Asha wiped away her remorseful tears, her sobs breaking her voice. Olivia felt a pang of sympathy watching Asha's sorrowful state. The child she'd raised with so much love and care for all those years turned out to have no biological connection to her.

But then, what happened to her own child?

Isabella squeezed Olivia's hand, their eyes meeting, both pondering the same question.

"Olivia, you should rest. Leave the rest to me," Isabella said hoarsely.

"No!" Olivia shook her head defiantly. "He's my child, my past. I have the right to know everything! Isabella, I don’t want to be hidden behind you, protected from the truth. I want to face everything with you."

Seeing the determination in Olivia's eyes, Isabella relented, whispering, "Alright."

As they turned to leave, Asha quickly wiped her tears, timidly asking, "Can I... can I see him? I promise I won't say anything. Just let me be near him, even as a servant."

Looking at Asha's humble plea, Olivia sighed. "You have every right to love your child. Tom is special, and you need to rest. Once you're better, you can visit him anytime. We'll go see him now and keep you updated."

"Thank you, Olivia," Asha said, her face relaxing into a resigned smile as she leaned back weakly. Her body, frail to begin with, was exhausted from sharing so much.

Olivia and Isabella left the room, heading straight for the intensive care unit where Tom was. Through the large glass window, Olivia saw the tiny, pale figure curled up under the blankets, resembling a stray pup with no home.

Olivia reached out, her hand touching the glass as if to caress Tom's small face. "You've got another mommy who loves you. Are you happy?"

Tom's doctor emerged from the ICU, greeting them. "Isabella, Olivia, here to see the patient?"

"Yes," Olivia replied, turning to face him.

"How is he doing?" she asked anxiously.

The doctor adjusted his glasses, "Better than expected! I hadn't wanted to worry you, but with the severe blood loss and prolonged lack of oxygen to his brain, there was a risk of brain death, potentially leaving him in a vegetative state. But it seems young Tom is strong. He’s pulled through! His condition is stable, and there are no signs of organ failure or dysfunction. If he makes it through tonight, he’ll be able to move to a regular ward tomorrow."

"That's fantastic news!" Olivia finally broke into a joyous smile, grabbing Isabella's hand, her eyes crinkling with happiness like a child.

Isabella affectionately ruffled Olivia's hair, gazing at her with a look of love and warmth. "Now that everything's okay, maybe it's time for you to get some rest?"

"No!" Olivia's smile faded. "I need to find Alexander Peterson!"

A complicated look crossed Isabella's eyes, but she said nothing, wrapping an arm around Olivia and leading her out.

In the cold, damp basement, Alexander Peterson sat slumped in a corner, his clothes tattered, revealing cuts beneath. His once fair and delicate face was now bruised and swollen, the elegant features distorted beyond recognition.

Clearly, life had not been kind to Alexander Peterson since his capture.

"Watch your step! It's slippery!" Isabella's voice came, deep and tender.

Alexander looked up, squinting into the dim light from the basement doorway to see Isabella and, behind her, Olivia Stewart.

He buried his face in his knees. He had dreamed of seeing her, but not like this — as Isabella's prisoner, in such a pitiful state.

Isabella carefully guided Olivia down the steps, leading her to where Alexander sat.

David Wright brought a bright lamp, illuminating Alexander's huddled form.

"Alexander Peterson!" Olivia called out.

Alexander looked up, surprise flickering in his eyes, quickly squinting against the harsh light. The shock in his gaze was unmistakable.

He had never expected Olivia would still want anything to do with him.

"Alexander, no matter what you've done to me before, I thought I could forgive. But this time, I've never hated anyone as much as I hate you!" Olivia's voice trembled with anger as she spoke each word.

Alexander lifted his head, his bruised face starkly visible in the light, the marks like a reflection of the filth in his soul, ugly and inescapable.

Olivia looked down at him, no trace of sympathy in her eyes. "How could you do it, Alexander? He's just a child!"

Olivia's voice shook with emotion, her lips quivering with rage.

Alexander nonchalantly replied, "If he couldn't handle a little challenge, he deserved a small punishment."

"A small punishment?" Olivia's fists clenched tightly. "You nearly killed him, and you call it a small punishment? What do you see human life as? Even if you're naturally cold-blooded, Tom is your own son!"
