In a grand dining room that seemed more like a setting from a fairytale than reality, Olivia Stewart found herself in a bizarre and awkward standoff with Isabella Peterson. The room, filled with the aroma of a lavish breakfast, felt colder than it should, given the tension hanging in the air.

Olivia had accidentally stumbled into Isabella's life—or perhaps it was Isabella who had stumbled into hers. Either way, the man was convinced she was someone else—a woman named Bai Yike. And despite her repeated denials, Isabella wouldn't take no for an answer.

“Listen, Isabella,” Olivia started, trying to keep her tone calm and reasonable, “we really need to talk about this whole situation.”

Isabella, standing with a rare mix of arrogance and hope in his eyes, replied, “Talk about what? If it’s not love, I’m not interested.”

Olivia rolled her eyes internally, trying not to show her frustration. “Isabella, I’m not Bai Yike.”

Isabella's expression hardened, the fires in his eyes burning brighter with indignation. “You owe me an explanation, whether you’re Bai Yike or Olivia Stewart. You ruined my engagement and now you owe me a wife and child. You choose which one to repay first.”

With that, he turned on his heel and left, leaving Olivia standing there, feeling a mix of disbelief and exasperation. She watched him go, the echo of his footsteps fading into the silence of the grand room. Her stomach growled, reminding her of the breakfast she hadn’t touched.

Sitting back down, Olivia sighed and poked at the untouched food, her appetite gone. She’d once dreamed of this kind of luxury, but now that it was here, it felt like a gilded cage rather than a fairy tale.

Just then, the kindly butler, Lucas Wright, walked in, interrupting her thoughts. His presence was like a warm breeze in the midst of a storm. “Morning, Olivia,” he greeted with a smile that crinkled his eyes. “Or should I still call you Bai Yike?”

Olivia forced a smile, grateful for his kindness. “Morning, Lucas. Please, just call me Olivia.”

Lucas chuckled, but his eyes were full of understanding. “You must understand, it’s the young master’s orders. He truly believes you’re Bai Yike.”

Olivia shook her head, feeling trapped in a surreal dream. “But I’m not. And I don’t know how to make him see that.”

Lucas placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. “He’s held onto hope for so long. Maybe give him a chance to explain his side?”

Before Olivia could respond, Isabella’s voice boomed from the staircase. “Olivia, are you chatting with Lucas again? You’ve got a thing for older men, huh?”

Olivia groaned inwardly as Isabella descended the stairs with the grace of a panther, every movement calculated yet casual. “He’s just being nice, Isabella. Not that you’d understand.”

Isabella smirked, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Nice? I’ll toss him in the lake if you keep ‘nice’ up.”

“You’re impossible!” Olivia huffed, crossing her arms defiantly.

Isabella reached her, his demeanor shifting from playful to intense. He gently but firmly caught her chin, leaning down to whisper, “Want to see a more humane side of me?”

Olivia’s heart skipped a beat, unsure whether to be afraid or intrigued. She felt a rush of emotions, both thrilling and terrifying. The man was infuriating, yet there was something undeniably magnetic about him.

Before she could formulate a reply, Isabella’s lips were on hers. It was sudden, unexpected, and overwhelmingly passionate. She pushed against him, her mind screaming resistance even as her body hesitated.

Finally breaking free, Olivia panted, glaring at Isabella with mixed emotions. “Stop it!”

Isabella propped himself up beside her, watching her with dark, unreadable eyes. “I’ll wait for you to remember, Bai Yike—or whoever you choose to be.”

Olivia turned away, tears threatening to spill over. This was a mess, a beautiful, convoluted mess, and she wasn’t sure how to navigate it. All she knew was that she couldn’t keep pretending to be someone she wasn’t. Yet, as she glanced back at Isabella, she wondered if maybe, just maybe, he’d be worth the trouble of finding out who she could be.
