Olivia Stewart was about to be in for the surprise of her life, and not necessarily the good kind. If it turned out that Lisa was behind all the drama, Isabella Peterson could think of a hundred ways to make her regret it. But if Sophie Cook was the mastermind, Olivia wouldn’t have the heart to retaliate, mostly because her brother Miguo cherished her as his only sister, and any harm to her would hurt him deeply too. 

Sophie Cook, the troublemaker!

Isabella slammed her fist on the table, frustration clouding her eyes. She delegated the remaining cleanup work to her team and headed back to her sanctuary, the Lakeside Retreat. 

Miguo was still in the dark about the whole ordeal, but in today’s digital age, secrets had a short shelf life. Isabella had to minimize the fallout before Miguo got wind of it and rush back to her side.

On the film set, despite Director Wang's strict orders against discussing the online scandal surrounding Miguo, whispers floated around like pollen in spring. The envious actresses, usually green with jealousy over Miguo's success, now wore smug, satisfied grins. Everyone except Sophie Cook.

Sophie wore a mask of worry, concealing her inner delight. Since last night, she had rehearsed her sympathetic act countless times, ready to play the concerned sister when Olivia Stewart hit rock bottom.

She couldn’t wait to put on the performance of a lifetime, pretending to comfort Olivia, all while savoring her downfall. With Isabella Peterson likely to drop Olivia, and her boyfriend, Tianyi, bound to abandon her, Olivia would fall from her high pedestal into obscurity. 

Mwahahaha!

Sophie could barely contain her glee and had to resist the urge to laugh out loud in solitude. She had meticulously planned this sabotage, investing all her savings from making indie films to buy a high-end message sender. She switched SIM cards and locations after each message, ensuring Olivia Stewart's reputation was thoroughly tarnished before she vanished all traces of her actions. She even destroyed the new phone she bought just for the occasion, leaving no witnesses.

Sophie was aware that Isabella Peterson was a formidable force, and no software was foolproof. Given time, they’d surely track her down. Hence, she had to clean up her tracks before they caught on, hoping that without concrete evidence, Miguo wouldn’t believe she was behind it.

Her plan was almost flawless, except that Olivia Stewart hadn’t shown up at the set. Clearly, Olivia was hiding or perhaps being shielded by Isabella, oblivious to the scandal.

Olivia, you must accept the gift I painstakingly prepared for you!

Sophie’s eyes were filled with resentment and malice. Her face twisted with anger, revealing scars that even makeup couldn’t hide. 

No, she had to stay calm. Maybe the enemy was waiting for her to slip up.

Sophie took deep breaths, trying to calm her nerves and act casual. To avoid suspicion, she didn’t dare call Olivia directly or inquire about her whereabouts.

As the morning dragged on with no sign of Olivia, the online insults rapidly disappeared like snacks at a party. Who else could orchestrate such a massive cleanup if not Isabella Peterson?

Sophie’s jealousy grew stronger. She needed to lure Miguo out!

The set was filled with gossipers who disliked her. If Olivia came, she’d quickly learn how the world now saw her.

Sophie clenched her fists, determination in her eyes, and headed to the bathroom. 

Outside the bathroom, she quickly checked her surroundings, ensuring no one was watching, and swallowed two strong pills dry, grimacing at the effort.

A cup of water appeared in front of her.

Startled, Sophie dropped the paper packet, and the pill she had just swallowed lodged in her throat. Tears sprung to her eyes.

Grabbing the cup, she gulped water down, forcing the pill down. As she caught her breath, she looked up in surprise. “Lisa?”

Lisa rolled her wheelchair to face Sophie, a knowing smile on her lips. “I’ve been keeping an eye on you.”

Caught in the act, Sophie felt a strange calm. “What do you want?”

Lisa continued to smile, her voice silky as she flicked her hair. “Just wondering if you need any help?”

Sophie’s face tightened. She clutched her stomach, dismissing Lisa, “No, go away!”

Lisa laughed, a light, mocking sound. “You think your little tricks can fool me? Though, they’re perfect for deceiving your stupid sister!”

Sophie’s face contorted in pain, glaring at Lisa.

Lisa elegantly wheeled around Sophie, her voice teasing, “Feeling the heat now? Sophie, did you really think your secret messages went unnoticed? I was your lookout, remember? Consider it my contribution.”

“You…” Sophie began, but a sharp pain cut her off, sending her rushing back to the bathroom.

She had taken two potent laxatives, intending to fake an illness to draw Olivia to the set. If anyone from the crew called Olivia, her plan would work. Yet she never expected Lisa to be lurking.

And Lisa, like a serpent, had seen right through her!

Minutes later, Sophie staggered out of the bathroom, pale and unsteady. She dared not stray far from the bathroom, leaning weakly against its door.

Lisa wheeled in, wrinkling her nose in distaste but still smiling. “According to plan, isn’t it time someone called her?”

Sophie remained silent, wary of Lisa.

“What, you don’t trust me?” Lisa sneered. “If I wanted to betray you, you wouldn’t be standing here now. Don’t worry, I hate Olivia as much as you do. I’d love to help you crush her.”

Lisa dialed Olivia’s number, her voice rising theatrically, “Oh no, Sophie! Sophie, are you okay? Hang in there!”

“No! Don’t tell my sister! She’s already stressed. I don’t want to burden her!” Sophie weakly shouted.

Lisa gave her an encouraging thumbs-up.

Both seasoned actresses, their act was seamless. But Sophie’s weakness wasn’t just for show. The laxative's effect was strong, and she had to crawl back to the bathroom.

Lisa watched Sophie’s plight, amused.

Fight, ladies, fight till you drop!

With her rivals out of the way, no one would stand between Lisa and her ambitions.

Lisa’s phone continued to echo Olivia’s worried calls, “Sophie! Sophie, what’s happening?”

Lisa smirked, responding with feigned urgency, “Olivia? Sophie’s collapsed with stomach pain. It looks like appendicitis. I’ll go check on her!”

Hanging up, Lisa smiled wickedly.

Olivia Stewart, Sophie is your Achilles’ heel. You’ll take the bait for sure!

Everyone knew Miguo’s weak spot. How could she resist?

Olivia dropped her phone and dashed out, nearly colliding with Lucas Wright. “I’m heading to the set!” she shouted, sprinting out the door.

Lucas, alarmed, relayed the situation to Isabella.

Isabella, halfway back to the Lakeside Retreat, immediately turned her car towards the set.

Olivia arrived at the set in a rush. Sophie lay in the break room, an IV in her arm.

Olivia hurried in, grasping Sophie’s hand. “Are you okay?”

Sophie opened her eyes weakly, tears spilling over. “I’m fine, sis. Sorry for worrying you.”

Olivia turned to the set doctor. “Dr. Wang, she looks terrible. Could it be appendicitis? Should we go to the hospital?”
