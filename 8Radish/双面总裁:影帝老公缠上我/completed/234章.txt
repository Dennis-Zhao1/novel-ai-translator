Olivia Stewart was having one of those days where everything seemed to be spiraling out of control. She was caught in a tense situation with Isabella Peterson, who had a knack for being both charming and infuriating. As she struggled to catch her breath, she finally managed to speak up, "Isabella, are you trying to suffocate me?"

Isabella, with a swift blush on his face, looked genuinely concerned. He released her a bit and, in a voice that brooked no argument, said, "Come home with me!"

Olivia blinked, trying to process what was happening. "I..."

"No refusing!" Isabella interrupted. "Next time, I'll use a gun on myself, not a lighter!"

Olivia, doing her best to keep her cool, shot him a look. "Isabella, seriously? Do you have no self-respect? You can't keep threatening your life. Man up!"

Isabella, with his dangerous smirk, replied softly, "You don't know?"

"Uh..." Olivia was caught off guard by Isabella's intense gaze. "Fine, I'll go with you!"

Isabella's lips curled into a mischievous smile as he planted a quick kiss on her cheek. "Good girl!"

Olivia rolled her eyes, her mind racing. Isabella might be overbearing, but she couldn't deny the thrill he brought to her life. Moving past the awkwardness, they soon found themselves driving out of town, the tension between them slowly giving way to an unspoken understanding.

As they approached the lakeside bridge, a fiery figure stood in their path. It was none other than White Miao, dressed in attention-grabbing red.

Olivia, still wrapped in Isabella's oversized jacket, muttered, "Your fianc√©e is here."

Hearing the jealousy in her voice, Isabella couldn't help but chuckle. "Are you jealous?"

"Hmph!" Olivia turned her head, pretending to ignore him.

"She's just someone my father set me up with," Isabella explained as they neared White Miao.

"Yet you got engaged to her!" Olivia countered, struggling with her emotions.

"Back then, it didn't matter who I married. But now, it's just an engagement, not a marriage," Isabella clarified, his words leaving Olivia speechless. Despite her protests, she couldn't help but feel a pang of satisfaction.

A tense silence settled in as Isabella's car sped towards the bridge. White Miao, frozen with fear, stood her ground in the car's path. Olivia, realizing the impending danger, shouted, "Isabella, are you crazy?"

But Isabella maintained his speed, the car racing towards White Miao. Just when it seemed inevitable, Olivia shielded her eyes, bracing for the worst.

To her surprise, the car came to a screeching halt. Olivia peeked through her fingers, relieved to find no blood or chaos. "Isabella, you scared me to death!"

Isabella reassured her, "Remember, White Miao is the outsider here. She's the one who needs to leave."

His words, filled with conviction, left Olivia's heart pounding. "I don't want to hurt her," she admitted, conflicted.

Isabella's gaze softened. "Stay by my side, and you won't have to worry about anything."

Olivia, still concerned, watched as White Miao picked herself up and fled. Isabella had only intended to scare her, but Olivia couldn't shake the feeling that they'd gone too far.

"Do you think we overdid it?" Olivia asked, her voice tinged with guilt.

Isabella's hand gently rested on her head. "Would you rather watch her ruin your relationship with me?"

Olivia managed a small smile, warmth spreading through her. Despite everything, she felt cherished, and Isabella's apology only deepened her affection for him.

"I'll sort things out with White Miao," Isabella promised, his voice sincere. "But these things take time."

Olivia nodded, trusting him despite the complications ahead.

Meanwhile, White Miao returned to her hotel in tears, calling her mother, Grace Martin, for support. Outraged at her daughter's treatment, Grace vowed to come to White Miao's aid and confront Isabella's family.

The following day, Olivia, trying to escape the drama, headed to a music studio to work on a new theme song. However, as she left the safe haven of their lakeside retreat, danger loomed. Two massive trucks appeared, intent on ramming her car off the road.

Trapped with no escape route, Olivia's bodyguard prepared for the worst, urging her to jump at his signal. Panic surged through Olivia, but she steeled herself, ready to take a leap into the unknown.
