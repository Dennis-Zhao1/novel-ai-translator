Alexander Peterson paced the dimly lit room, frustration etched on his face. "You're no real Peterson, that's for sure," he grumbled, tossing a piece of stale bread onto the floor as if it were a royal offering.

Young Tommy looked down at the bread. It was a far cry from the gourmet meals he was used to at the Watercloud Mansion; even the servants there ate better than this. But hunger gnawed at his insides, and with no other option, he hesitated before picking up the bread to nibble on.

Tears welled up as he thought of the warmth and comfort he had left behind. Auntie Grace was always kind, never quite as affectionate as with the twins, but she always smiled at him, made sure he ate enough during meals, and asked if he was satisfied. Uncle Charles, though less warm, never hurt him, unlike this Alexander with his threatening demeanor and sharp, menacing knife.

With such a caring family, why did he ever leave? Why try to escape?

His tears fell faster, making it hard to swallow even the meager bread, though his stomach begged for sustenance.

"Stop crying! If you won't eat, then don't!" Alexander snapped, kicking the bread aside. "Now, tell me more about Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson!"

Tommy shivered, "No… Uncle, please let me go!"

Alexander took out a small gold knife, tapping it lightly against Tommy’s cheek. "Be a good boy and talk. Do it well, and maybe I’ll get you some candy. Otherwise..."

Terrified, Tommy quickly blurted out, "I'll talk! Just don’t cut me! It hurts so bad! If I bleed out, I'll die, waah..."

Alexander grabbed him roughly. "Cut the tears! You're pathetic!"

"I'll talk, I’ll talk. The day I came back..." Tommy’s voice was a mix of sniffles and whispers, afraid to raise his voice. His pitiful state didn’t move Alexander, who was entirely focused on squeezing every detail out of him, hoping to find some hint of a possible split between Olivia and Isabella.

When Tommy recounted how Isabella and Olivia had a falling-out but then reconciled, Alexander erupted like a volcano, his eyes blazing with anger. "Isabella, so petty and obsessed with cleanliness, knowing you're not his child... how can he bear it? How?"

"It's all your fault! Useless little brat! Sending you to them served no purpose!" Furious, Alexander raised the gold knife again...

Back at the Watercloud Mansion, Olivia Stewart woke up with a scream, the nightmare of Tommy being sliced by Alexander haunting her even under sedation. She knew Alexander had mental issues; he had spared her once, but Tommy might not be so lucky.

Worried sick, she was like a cat on hot bricks, but seeing Isabella’s bloodshot eyes, she couldn’t bring herself to rush him.

It had been two long days and nights with no word on Tommy’s whereabouts. Isabella had combed through the city’s transport network but found no clues. Remembering her own kidnapping, Isabella suspected Alexander was hiding in some secluded suburb, sending out teams to investigate. But it was a time-consuming task, and results weren’t immediate.

Olivia stumbled out of her room, spotting Lucas Wright heading to the study with a coffee tray. She quickly called out, "Lucas!"

Lucas bowed slightly, "Yes, Miss Stewart?"

She glanced at the coffee. "Change it to milk, please."

"Uh..." Lucas hesitated, torn. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to comply, but Isabella relied on coffee to stay alert, and he might not drink milk.

Olivia gave him a reassuring look. "Please, just do it. I’ll take it to him."

Lucas’ eyes brightened. "Sure, Miss Stewart, I’ll be right back!"

He returned shortly with a tray holding a steaming cup of milk and a small plate of delicate pastries. Handing it to Olivia, he expressed concern, "Master hasn’t slept or eaten much these past days. If he drinks the milk, please encourage him to have some pastries too. Even a strong man can’t take this much strain!"

Olivia felt a pang of guilt, recalling her harsh words accusing Isabella of not trying hard enough because Tommy wasn’t his child. She had been out of her mind to say such hurtful things.

She bit her lip, "Don’t worry, I’ll take care of him. With me here, you can focus on the twins."

Lucas bowed deeply. "It’s my duty to care for Master and the young ones."

Olivia entered the study, knocking softly on the door that wasn’t locked. Inside, only the rapid clatter of keyboard keys responded.

She quietly approached Isabella, setting the milk beside him. Absorbed in his work, his hand reached for the usual coffee spot, bringing the cup to his lips. The unusual taste made him frown slightly, glancing down to see milk instead of coffee.

His irritation was clear. "I asked for coffee, not milk! Are you trying to keep me awake or put me to sleep?"

Olivia’s voice was gentle, "I just don’t want you to wear yourself out."

The softness of her words startled Isabella, thinking he had imagined them. But when he looked up, Olivia stood there, her eyes filled with warmth.

Instantly, his annoyance vanished. He pulled her close, noticing her pale face, "You’re awake? Why not rest a bit longer?"

"I’m fine, but you shouldn’t overwork yourself. Proper rest and nutrition are important."

She took the milk, bringing it to his lips. Isabella’s eyes sparkled like stars. He drank it all in one go, looking satisfied. Olivia then offered him a pastry, coaxing him softly, "I heard you haven’t eaten much lately. Please, eat something."

He took a bite, nibbling her fingertips lightly. "Who told you that? Don’t listen to their nonsense."

"Isabella..." Olivia leaned against his chest, her voice thick with emotion. "I’m sorry for what I said before. I was just so worried about Tommy."

Isabella squeezed her hand but remained silent, fearing the worst for Tommy. If anything happened to him, how could he face Olivia?

Yet, he kept his composure. After a comforting pat on her back, he gently pushed her away, "Alright, I need to work. You should rest more or check on the twins."

Olivia looked at him earnestly. "I’ve asked Lucas to watch the twins. I want to help find Tommy, even if it’s just to keep you company and take care of you."

A wave of tenderness washed over Isabella, his eyes misting. This was the first time Olivia hadn’t put the children first, showing genuine concern for him.

Maybe it was silly for a grown man to be jealous of kids, but everyone needs love, right? Kids express it openly, while adults are more reserved.

He held Olivia’s hand tightly, and even when it hurt, she didn’t complain. She realized then that this seemingly invincible man was just a big kid at heart, needing love and support.

After a moment, Isabella released her, diving back into his search. He was mapping out possible hiding spots in the city, marking locations where Alexander might be.

Watching the dizzying array of maps, Olivia quickly realized how exhausting this was for him. She moved behind Isabella, gently massaging his temples.

"Am I disturbing you?"

Isabella closed his eyes briefly, savoring the touch, then focused again, "No, you’re not."

Relieved, she continued, "Good. If your eyes get tired, take a break, or look outside at the sky or trees."

Isabella patted her hand, returning his gaze to the screen. Olivia continued the massage, then paused, an idea forming. "I have a suggestion."

Isabella turned slightly, intrigued, "What suggestion?"
