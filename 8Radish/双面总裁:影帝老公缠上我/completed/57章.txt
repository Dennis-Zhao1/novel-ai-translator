Title: The Misadventures of Olivia and Isabella

"Wait a minute, I need to check the closet!" Olivia Stewart exclaimed, her voice tinged with urgency.

"What's the rush?" Isabella Peterson said, holding her back. "If those clothes are the problem, you'll only make the rash worse by going near them. That woman isn't going anywhere. Let's finish applying the ointment first."

"Alright, alright...hey, Isabella, where are you touching? Just apply the ointment properly, no need for the massage!" Olivia protested.

"You think I enjoy tending to a patient covered in red bumps?" Isabella retorted sarcastically. "The doctor said the massage helps the ointment work better."

"Fine, but I'll handle the back myself!" Olivia replied, a bit flustered.

"Are you sure your hands have the right temperature? Do you know the exact pressure to use? If you mess it up and leave a scar, I'm not responsible!" Isabella continued, her tone teasing yet firm.

Olivia was momentarily taken aback. Wasn't applying ointment supposed to be straightforward? Since when did it come with so many instructions?

With a detailed precision akin to a seasoned doctor, Isabella applied the ointment across Olivia's skin. Despite the meticulous care, there was a hint of something deeper in Isabella's dark eyes that was hard to ignore.

Once done, Isabella helped Olivia into a new, loose-fitting cotton nightgown.

Olivia stretched her limbs, letting out a sigh of relief. "Wow, this feels so much better!"

"Stay put," Isabella instructed as she tidied up the ointment supplies and headed to the restroom to wash her hands. Returning, she scooped Olivia up into her arms.

Flustered, Olivia protested, "Isabella, you don't have to do this. I can walk!"

Isabella's eyes narrowed as she carried Olivia out, declaring, "I want to."

Olivia settled into Isabella's arms, bewildered by her assertiveness. When did Isabella become so domineering?

Outside the door, Lucas Wright and his team were already waiting. As Isabella carried Olivia out, gloved staff entered to search for the allergen.

"Focus on the closet!" Isabella instructed coolly.

Olivia playfully poked Isabella's chest. "Shouldn't we wait here for the results?"

Isabella's brow furrowed. "They'll report back when they find something. Keep poking, and don't blame me for not treating you like a patient!"

Olivia immediately stopped, remembering Isabella's earlier warning. Though she was slowly succumbing to Isabella's charm, her mind wasn't entirely ready to accept being someone else's second choice.

Isabella carried Olivia downstairs to the living room, placing her gently on the couch next to him. Almost immediately, Olivia noticed Alyssa standing there, her eyes red and swollen, shoulders trembling as she cried quietly.

Olivia fixed her gaze on Alyssa, asking seriously, "Alyssa, did you do this to me?"

Alyssa remained silent, so one of the bodyguards spoke up, "Alyssa tried to escape and was acting suspiciously, so we brought her back."

Disappointment flickered in Olivia's eyes as she sat quietly on the couch, waiting. She knew Alyssa wouldn't confess until irrefutable evidence was in front of her, and that moment was fast approaching.

A few minutes later, Lucas and the staff returned, carrying all of Olivia's nightgowns from the closet. Lucas held a small amount of fine powder in his gloved palm.

"Sir!" he called out.

Isabella nodded towards the doctor, who approached to examine the clothes. With insulated gloves, he carefully picked up a garment and inspected it under the light, sniffing it gently.

Isabella's eyes darkened with suspicion as the doctor handled Olivia's nightgown.

The doctor soon returned to Lucas, took a small pinch of the powder, and after analyzing it, approached Isabella with a respectful bow. "Sir, we found the allergen! The clothes were treated with a problematic fragrance containing allergenic nettle components."

Alyssa's face turned pale as she collapsed to her knees in front of Isabella and Olivia, sobbing, "Please, sir, have mercy!"

Isabella shot a cold, piercing glare at Alyssa, silencing her pleas.

Olivia frowned, turning to the doctor. "But I've been wearing these clothes for days. Why did I only start feeling uncomfortable today?"

"The earlier nettle was mixed in with the floral fragrance, in very small amounts, unlikely to be noticed unless someone is extremely sensitive. Most people would only start feeling uncomfortable after a few days. However, the powder found today contained a large amount of nettle pollen, causing immediate and severe allergic reactions," the doctor explained.

"No wonder I felt itchier after changing into a new nightgown. I caught Alyssa in the act, spreading the powder!" Olivia realized, frustration evident in her voice.

Standing up, Olivia glared down at Alyssa, demanding, "Alyssa, we've never had any issues before. Why hurt me?"

"I'm sorry, Olivia, I'm so sorry..." Alyssa repeated, her head bowed in remorse.

Isabella kicked Alyssa aside, his tone icy. "My woman asked you a question. Answer!"

Alyssa glanced up at Isabella with tear-filled eyes, her sobs intensifying.

Olivia stepped closer, eyeing Alyssa intently. "Is it because of Isabella?"

Alyssa trembled, her face betraying her answer.

Understanding dawned on Olivia as she returned to Isabella's side, casually settling into his lap. "Alyssa, you're jealous, aren't you?"

Caught, Alyssa was speechless, her face ghostly pale.

"It seems I played the part of the Good Samaritan, only to save a snake. Alyssa, I don't believe I've wronged you. When you were punished for lending me your phone, I pleaded on your behalf to bring you back from the outer grounds. Why would you harm me?"

Alyssa lifted her head, her eyes filled with resentment. "Yes, Olivia, I was wrong. I repaid your kindness with harm. But before, the master was unattainable, yet everyone hoped. Now, he's yours alone! We're both young and pretty, so why should you enjoy his affection while I serve you?"

"You think you can compare to my woman?" Isabella retorted coldly, kicking Alyssa again. "Don't test my limits! I have no qualms about hitting women!"

"Enough!" Olivia chided, patting Isabella's leg. "Don't be so ungentlemanly."

"Ungentlemanly? Olivia, I'm standing up for you, and you call me ungentlemanly? Have you no gratitude?"

"Alright, Isabella, since this mess involves me, let me handle it, okay?"

"Playing the Good Samaritan again?"

Olivia gave Isabella a reassuring look. Alyssa, sensing an opportunity, crawled toward Olivia, pleading, "Olivia, I was wrong, I'll never do it again. Please, forgive me!"

Olivia watched Alyssa with a gentle smile. "Alyssa, you really want me to forgive you, don't you?"

"Olivia, I truly regret it!"

"Too bad, I'm not as forgiving as you hoped. I won't give you another chance to hurt me!"

"Alyssa, I'm not a fool. I can tell right from wrong, and your act doesn't fool me. Your eyes gave you away long ago," Olivia said, her voice firm.

Alyssa's face went as white as a sheet, her cries forgotten. "So you won't let me go?"

"Bingo!" Olivia snapped her fingers. "But I'll make sure you accept your loss."

"Alyssa, you think we're both young and pretty, but Isabella chose me, not you. That's not my fault. Either his taste is questionable, or I'm just more attractive and charming."

Isabella quickly added, "Of course, you're more attractive and charming!"

Olivia shot him a look before continuing, "You like Isabella. You could have tried to win him over, done everything to get his attention. But you shouldn't have hurt me! If you can't win the man you want, don't take it out on other women. Women like that are despicable!"

Shaking her head, Olivia's tone was one of disappointment. "You started this, so don't blame me for finishing it!"
