Some things get deep under your skin.

The little munchkin wasn't too pleased with the butler's silent treatment. Her lips puckered into an adorable pout, "I'm asking you a question!"

The butler was so tickled by her cute expression that he couldn't help but laugh. "Alright, alright, I'll teach you! Right away!"

Watching from the side, Birch Pines felt his eyes getting misty. His granddaughter was truly a little angel! If only he could reveal their relationship now; he'd scoop her up and smother her with kisses!

The butler walked over, grabbing the lawn mower to demonstrate the finer points of operating it to Birch Pines. With little Guoguo watching him closely, his demeanor softened, and he explained things carefully. After all, although Guoguo wasn't the master's biological daughter, she was cherished a hundred times over. If he slipped up and she mentioned anything to the master, he'd be in big trouble!

Feeling like she'd done something great, Guoguo ran back to Olivia Stewart, tugging on her hand as if asking for praise. "Mommy, did I do well?"

Olivia Stewart's lips curved into a gentle smile.

Guoguo jumped with joy. "Then tell me I'm awesome, okay?"

Olivia Stewart looked into her bright, twinkling eyes, her lips moving but no sound coming out.

Guoguo's little mouth drooped in disappointment.

"You did great!" Coco suddenly chimed in, his cool little face showing no expression.

Guoguo's eyes lit up again, her smile wide and bright, pulling Olivia Stewart's hand. "Mommy, let's go back!"

Birch Pines' attention was entirely on Olivia Stewart and the twins, so he wasn't focusing on the lawnmower, making it sputter and stall frequently.

Once Olivia Stewart and the kids were out of sight, the butler's expression changed instantly. "If you can't do this job, you should just leave!"

Birch Pines quickly refocused, apologizing while earnestly trying to get the lawnmower to work smoothly. This time, he did much better; although his movements still seemed clumsy, at least he was faster and steadier with the machine.

The butler glanced at the patchy lawn Birch Pines had mowed, looking as if it had been chewed by a dog, and felt the urge to send him packing. But remembering how Guoguo had spoken up for him, he shook his head, sighed, and walked away.

And so, Birch Pines and Grace Martin remained at Ethan King's ranch. Birch Pines became a regular ranch hand, while Grace Martin was assigned to help in the kitchen.

Ethan King had been busy all day. When he returned home and heard that Guoguo had taken Olivia Stewart to the hiring spot to watch some chaos, he hurried over. Under the serene night sky, in front of the ranch's cozy cabin, Olivia Stewart was strumming a bass guitar, singing the sweet and joyful song "Secretly Fallen for You."

This was the theme song of the movie "Send an Angel to Love You," in which Olivia Stewart co-starred with Isabella Peterson. It was a global hit, and the film's game adaptation was also wildly popular worldwide. Yet, no one expected that the beautiful girl from the romantic fairy tale would become so melancholic.

Ethan King stood silently in the corner, listening to the song, gazing at Olivia Stewart's gentle, slightly downcast face. At that moment, his heart felt like it was being squeezed, filled with a mixture of pain and bitterness.

Olivia Stewart's skill in playing and singing was masterful. Even though she didn't interact with others much these days, some things were so ingrained they were part of her very being. Even in her own world, she couldn't forget them for a moment.

At that moment, Ethan King understood that he might never truly enter Olivia Stewart's heart. So he'd just be her guy best friend for life, a special presence in her heart.

Ethan King thought with a touch of bitterness.

He stood there for a long time, until Olivia Stewart and the kids went back to the cabin, before turning to leave. Initially, he just wanted to make sure Olivia Stewart wasn't upset by external changes. Seeing her current state, it seemed she was doing well.

Ethan King felt both relieved and a little sad. He hoped Olivia Stewart would heal, but her recovery might mean he wouldn't even have the chance to be this close to her.

Wandering along the edge of the ranch, lost in thought, Ethan King didn't head straight back to his residence. The houses on the ranch were mostly standalone cottages, unlike the grand, sprawling estates elsewhere, yet they had a certain poetic charm.

As he walked, he heard a commotion carried by the wind.

Frowning, Ethan King didn't like dealing with these trivial matters, but his father insisted he stay at the ranch to learn management, threatening otherwise to force him into marriage and children! For Olivia Stewart's peace, Ethan King reluctantly agreed. He'd been inspecting ranches for days, nearly exhausting himself.

Now, in this tranquil ranch setting, someone was arguing, ruining the mood!

With mild annoyance, Ethan King headed toward the kitchen, recognizing the loud voice as belonging to Mrs. Lee, the cook. Mrs. Lee was a plump, straightforward woman with a booming voice. Despite being in Australia, the King family brought most of their staff from home for a touch of familiarity.

Just as Ethan King reached the door, he heard Mrs. Lee exclaiming loudly, "Look at this mess! You can't even tell scallions from chives! You're supposed to keep the leaves, but you tossed them all out, leaving just bare stems. What are people supposed to eat?"

"Have you ever done any work at all? You look like a pampered lady from a wealthy family!"

"The butler must have lost his mind hiring you. I need to talk to him before we all get kicked out because of you!"

"Please, don't!" A soft, pleading voice responded. "Mrs. Lee, please give me another chance. I promise I'll do better!"

Mrs. Lee sighed heavily. "It's not easy making a living away from home, and I don't mean to give you a hard time! But you clearly aren't cut out for this work!"

"Let me cook instead," the woman pleaded. "I can make all kinds of dishes, especially nourishing soups. They're really good!"

"Ha!" Mrs. Lee scoffed, her anger flaring up again. "You can't even prep the veggies, and you want to cook? If something goes wrong and the master's served bad food, who's taking the blame? If you want to mess things up, don't drag me into it!"

"Mrs. Lee, I'm serious! Please…"

Ethan King couldn't listen any longer. He pushed open the door.

Both women turned to face him, looking shocked.

"Young Master!" Mrs. Lee greeted quickly.

Grace Martin snapped out of it and followed suit, bowing her head. "Hello, Young Master!"

Ethan King's gaze settled on Grace Martin. Though she appeared simple, her movements had an elegance suggesting she wasn't used to manual labor. Given what Mrs. Lee said about her not knowing onions from chives, her purpose at the ranch warranted further investigation.

"Are you the new hire today?" Ethan King asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Grace Martin answered honestly, "Yes, my husband works here, and I'm helping out in the kitchen since I'm not good at other tasks."

"You can't even handle kitchen work!" Mrs. Lee interjected bluntly, pointing out Grace Martin's shortcomings in front of Ethan King.

Grace Martin quickly apologized and sincerely pleaded, "Please, Young Master, believe me, I will do better! Just don't send me away. I may not be good at prep work, but I can cook well, especially make soups. I don't even need to be paid, just let me stay!"

"Oh?" Ethan King feigned interest to confirm his suspicions. "What's your story? Tell me."

Grace Martin hesitated, looking a bit embarrassed, then said, "To be honest, Young Master, I've never done this kind of kitchen work before."

"You…" Mrs. Lee exclaimed, pointing at Grace Martin in shock and anger, feeling utterly vexed by her ignorance.

Ethan King gave Mrs. Lee a cool glance, signaling her to let Grace Martin continue.

Grace Martin gave a self-deprecating smile, then went on, "I was raised as a pampered daughter, never doing such tasks."

Ethan King's eyes showed understanding. Her innate elegance was something ingrained from a young age, unchangeable.

"After I married my husband, he… he got involved with another woman," Grace Martin's voice dropped as she continued. "I heard that to win a man's heart, you must first win his stomach. So, I learned to cook from our family chef. Of course, the prep work was always done by servants. That's why I can cook but can't prep!"

"I spent years learning, enduring hardship, finally mastering various dishes and soups. But my husband never once looked back at me…"
