Olivia Stewart was lost in thought on her ride back to the Watercloud Mansion, staring silently out the window. Her usually calm face was now tinged with sadness.

When the car pulled up next to the garden outside the grand estate, Michael Wright, her driver, got out and opened the door for her. "We're here, Olivia," he said politely.

Snapping out of her daze, Olivia stepped out of the car and noticed she was still clutching a contract tightly in her hand. Her delicate brow furrowed as she considered how to explain the whole lead actress situation to Isabella Peterson. Isabella was known for being domineering and not exactly the sharing type. Would he even agree to let the role go to Sophie Cook?

Feeling like she had just stumbled upon a ray of light in a maze, Olivia felt a bit more hopeful. She knew what Sophie, her sister, needed most. Even if it hurt her, Olivia was willing to give Sophie the best opportunities. It was a lesson drilled into her by her parents: "The elder sister always lets the younger one have her way."

With renewed resolve, Olivia clutched the contract and picked up her pace. Suddenly, she collided with something—or rather, someone—hard enough to make her step back and wince.

"Olivia! Do you walk with your eyes closed?" Isabella Peterson grumbled, though he reached out to steady her, lightly rubbing her forehead.

Feeling a surge of irritation, Olivia pushed him away. "Hey! It's your fault for being built like a brick wall! I wasn’t paying attention, sure, but you didn’t have to be right in my path. Now my nose is all bruised and you're rubbing my forehead—what good does that do?"

Isabella smirked, finding her complaints amusing. "I did it on purpose," he teased, his tone both playful and commanding. With a teasing glint in his eye, he asked, "Were you thinking about me just now? If not, I might have to remind you who’s in charge."

Olivia rolled her eyes dramatically. "Oh please, I was just wondering who's more handsome, you or that movie star everyone’s swooning over."

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "And your conclusion?"

"Well, I suppose both of you have your charms," Olivia replied with a mischievous smile. "But he seems a bit more...gentle."

"Are you implying I'm rough?" Isabella growled, his eyes widening in mock outrage.

Olivia quickly backtracked, "No, no, I meant you're more...assertive. My favorite assertive guy!"

Isabella huffed, clearly enjoying the banter. "And which do you prefer?"

"You guess!" Olivia replied cheekily.

Isabella tightened his grip slightly, a hint of insecurity in his voice. "You better not like him, or else..."

Olivia laughed softly. "I like assertive and gentle."

Isabella was left speechless. He had spent all this time being jealous of himself! Had he inadvertently created a competitor for his own affection?

Seeing Isabella's furrowed brows, Olivia felt a twinge of anxiety. Maybe he already knew about her signing the contract and was upset. Would it be easier to ask for a favor if she presented her case now?

Gathering her thoughts, Olivia put on her most earnest expression. "Isabella, I did something today without asking you first. You might not be pleased."

"Did you meet another guy behind my back?" Isabella's eyes glimmered with a dangerous edge.

"Ugh, no! Get your mind out of the gutter," Olivia retorted, thrusting the contract into his face. "Look!"

Isabella glanced at the papers, raising an eyebrow. "Signed up for a movie? As the lead? My Olivia has got guts!"

He wasn’t mad?

Olivia was taken aback, watching Isabella's reaction carefully. She added cautiously, "And I’m acting opposite that movie star heartthrob, playing love interests!"

Isabella's eyes glinted with mischief as he suddenly pulled her close and kissed her deeply, leaving Olivia breathless and her contract papers scattered on the ground.

Just as things started heating up, Isabella scooped Olivia into his arms, heading upstairs. But when he inadvertently kicked the discarded papers, Olivia snapped out of her daze.

"My contract!" she exclaimed, wriggling free from his grasp to fetch the papers.

Isabella's face darkened. "Those papers more important than me?"

Olivia, busy collecting the contract, replied without looking up, "Of course the contract is more important!"

Feeling slighted, Isabella kicked one of the pages away. "Want me to tear it up?"

Olivia paused, eyeing him curiously. "Are you jealous, Isabella?"

"Jealous? Me? Ha!" he scoffed, trying to mask his true feelings.

"If you don't want me to act, I won't," Olivia offered seriously, standing to face him.

Isabella's eyebrows shot up. "You should do it! Why not?"

"Why are you suddenly so supportive? Aren't you worried I might fall for that star?" Olivia teased.

Isabella laughed coolly. "I trust my own charm."

Olivia chuckled. "You’re so full of yourself!"

"If you really fall for him, I'll just have to remind you who you belong to," Isabella replied, a playful threat lingering in his words.

Olivia sighed, realizing her attempt to provoke his jealousy had failed. Instead, she decided to come clean. "I don’t want to do it."

"You don't want to?" Isabella's voice boomed, eyebrows arching in surprise.

This ungrateful little... He had gone to such lengths to create this opportunity for her, and now she was backing out?

Olivia shrank back slightly, caught off guard by his reaction. "Wouldn't you prefer I not go around getting cozy with some other guy?"

Isabella was at a loss for words. Revealing his true intentions would spoil the fun.

"Why sign the contract if you didn’t want to?" he asked, trying to maintain his composure.

"That's what I wanted to talk to you about," Olivia admitted, holding up the contract. "I was kind of pressured into signing it. Could you maybe pull some strings and let Sophie have the role instead?"

"Olivia, have you lost your mind? You know what this role means! A chance like this doesn't come around often. You're seriously considering giving it up to your sister after everything she’s done?" Isabella was exasperated.

Olivia looked down, mumbling, "I never really wanted to be an actress..."

Isabella looked at her, a mix of frustration and disbelief on his face. "Are you serious?"

"Yeah," Olivia nodded.

"Fine, I'll get you out of it, but not for your sister," Isabella said, a plan forming in his mind.

"No, it has to be Sophie," Olivia insisted.

Isabella snorted. "Olivia, you give your sister everything. What if she wanted your man too? Would you give him up?"

Olivia hesitated, unsure of how to respond.

Isabella released her, a smirk on his lips as he turned and walked away, leaving Olivia standing there, pondering his words. "What if your sister wanted your man... would you let her have him?"
