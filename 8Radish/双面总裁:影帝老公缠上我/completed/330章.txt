Isabella Peterson had no idea Olivia Stewart was carrying such a heavy burden. While Isabella was caught up in the turmoil of dealing with the child's situation, Olivia was grappling with her own guilt. Maybe if Isabella hadn't been so petty and focused on Olivia's past, Olivia might have felt less guilty. But there's no use in dwelling on "what ifs"—there's no magic cure for regret.

With her eyes tightly shut, Isabella whispered to herself, "Is there really no way out of this?" She looked less like her usual commanding self and more like a brooding, melancholic young man.

The therapist, noticing Isabella's distress, handed her a glass of water. "Olivia has her own agency," the therapist reassured. "Once she overcomes that mental hurdle, she'll pull through. From my analysis, her happiest times were spent with that eccentric guy, Ethan King. That's why I suggested his involvement."

Isabella clenched her fists. "Got it. I'll make sure you get your fee, plus a million-dollar bonus." The therapist was taken aback, despite his reputation, he didn't earn that kind of money often. Who would turn down more cash?

"Thank you, Isabella. If you ever need anything else, just let me know," the therapist said with a deep bow.

Isabella turned and left, her luxury car waiting downstairs. Once inside, she dialed Ethan King without hesitation. "Get here now, Ethan, drop everything and come to Golden City," she ordered before hanging up abruptly, hurling her phone aside in frustration.

The phone hit the floor, splitting into pieces. Isabella punched the steering wheel, the dull thud echoing her simmering anger.

Olivia Stewart's happiest memories were with Ethan King, someone she had ruthlessly pushed away. If only Isabella hadn't intervened, Olivia might have enjoyed a carefree life with someone who understood her, instead of facing jealousy, intrigues, and relentless drama.

Isabella covered her heart, feeling an ache at the thought of handing Olivia over to Ethan. The idea that Olivia might develop feelings for Ethan with time gnawed at her, but she knew she had to do it to help Olivia heal.

Back at her estate, Isabella trudged inside, ignoring the greetings from the household staff. She couldn't shake the thought of delivering Olivia into Ethan's hands, feeling as if she was tearing a piece of her soul away.

Olivia was sitting on a swing in the garden, basking in the sun. The scene was serene, with Olivia looking ethereal against the backdrop of a mermaid fountain. Isabella couldn't resist capturing the moment on her phone. For the first time, she understood why people loved sharing their joy on social media.

Yet, as she considered posting it, she hesitated. This precious moment was too personal to share with the world. Isabella put her phone away and approached Olivia.

"Olivia," she called softly, crouching to meet her gaze. Her eyes were filled with tenderness, a stark contrast to her usual authoritative demeanor.

Olivia's eyes met Isabella's, clear and devoid of emotion, like a newborn's gaze—pure and innocent.

"Remember Ethan, your dear friend? He's coming to see you," Isabella said, watching Olivia closely for any sign of recognition or reaction. Olivia seemed to listen intently, her eyes briefly flickering with a hint of light.

Isabella sighed. It seemed Olivia still held a connection to Ethan, who had always accepted her without judgment or jealousy.

"Once Ethan arrives, you should go with him to his ranch. A change of scenery might do you good," Isabella suggested, hoping nature's tranquility would help Olivia relax away from the bustling city.

Ethan arrived the next evening. Isabella told him everything, sparing no details, even the ones that might tarnish her own pride. The therapist had emphasized the importance of providing Olivia with a sense of security and positive reinforcement, and Ethan needed to understand her situation fully to help.

As soon as Isabella finished, Ethan punched her, sending her staggering back. Isabella could have dodged it, but she didn't.

Wiping the blood from her lip, Isabella looked at Ethan. "Hit me again if you want."

Ethan sneered, "You think hitting you will ease your guilt? If Olivia doesn't get better, you'll live with that guilt forever."

Isabella met his gaze, unfazed. "You have three years. If you can't help Olivia by then, I'll bring her back and be with her for the rest of her days."

"And if she chooses me within those three years?" Ethan challenged, knowing full well the risk of asking such a bold question.

To his surprise, Isabella didn't retaliate. Instead, she promised, "If she chooses you of her own free will, I will step aside."

"Deal," Ethan agreed, a newfound determination in his eyes.

That very day, Ethan took Olivia with him. As the plane took off, Olivia showed no signs of longing or regret. She seemed indifferent to where Ethan was taking her or for how long, perhaps subconsciously yearning to escape her current surroundings. Her trust in Ethan was unwavering, knowing he'd never doubted her.

Watching the plane disappear into the sky, Isabella whispered, "Olivia, I wish you happiness."

A gust of wind rustled the nearby grass as Isabella stood alone on the tarmac, then slowly walked away.

"Did you really send her away?" a voice called out from the steps. It was Alex, standing there with a defiant look.

Isabella glared at him for a moment before growling, "Get lost!"

It was all because of this little troublemaker, causing rifts and misunderstandings between him and Olivia, leading to her depression and withdrawal.

But Alex didn't back down. Despite trembling, he insisted, "She's my mom. I have the right to know where she went!"

The word "mom" struck a nerve with Isabella. He grabbed Alex by the collar and lifted him off the ground, anger flaring in his eyes.

Alex paled but refused to relent...
