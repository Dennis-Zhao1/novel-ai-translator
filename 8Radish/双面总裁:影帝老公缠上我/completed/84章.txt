要不要报警

Sophie Cook found herself in the backseat of a taxi, the driver giving her a concerned glance. "You okay back there?" he asked, his voice tinged with worry.

Sophie shook her head vigorously, retreating further into her seat and wrapping her arms around herself in a protective gesture. "No, nothing's wrong," she insisted, though her voice betrayed her.

The driver, a man who had seen enough of life to understand more than he let on, sighed sympathetically. "Do you need to go to the police?"

"No! Mind your own business!" Sophie snapped, her voice edged with panic. "If you call the cops, I'll... I'll..."

The threat hung in the air, but it was empty. What good would it do to call the police now? She had suffered enough humiliation last night, and if Henry Adams got arrested, her scandal would be all over the tabloids. Her bright future—gone.

The driver wisely kept silent, not wanting to provoke her further. "All right, all right, no police. Just rest, and I'll get you home," he said, starting the car and driving away from the rundown area.

Sophie finally let her guard down a bit, exhaustion taking over as she drifted into a restless sleep.

When she woke up, the familiar city skyline greeted her through the window, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic alleyway where her nightmare had unfolded. She noticed the car was parked, and she tensed up immediately.

The driver had returned to the car, sitting in the front seat with a friendly smile. "Morning. We're back in Gold City now. You looked so peaceful, I didn't want to wake you."

Sophie Cook's stomach growled embarrassingly, and the driver handed her a small bag with a warm drink and some food. "Figured you might be hungry."

She accepted the breakfast hesitantly, the warmth of the cup soothing her shaky hands. Tears welled up in her eyes and spilled over, unstoppable.

The driver handed her tissues silently, letting her cry it out. Eventually, her sobs subsided into quiet sniffles.

"Listen," he ventured cautiously, "I know it's none of my business, but you shouldn't let this slide. You should really con—"

"No!" Sophie interrupted, her voice rising in panic.

"Hey, it's okay. How about I go with you?" he offered, pointing across the street to the police station.

Sophie recoiled, her anger flaring. "Why did you bring me here? Who do you think you are?"

"I'm just trying to help," the driver said, his hands up in surrender.

"I don't need your help!" she shouted, throwing the breakfast he had given her back at him before bolting from the car.

Sophie ran until she found another taxi, directing it back to her college—the prestigious Gold City Film Academy, where she was determined to maintain her image as the bright, promising star everyone knew.

At the academy, she avoided the usual bustling paths, keeping her head down and moving quickly to her dorm, hoping to avoid any prying eyes or gossipy students.

As she reached her door, she could hear her roommates talking animatedly inside. "Olivia Stewart's the lead in 'Send an Angel to Love You.' Can you believe it? She's stunning even without makeup!"

"Yeah, but does she have connections or what? She's so lucky!"

Sophie hesitated outside, her heart sinking at the mention of her sister Olivia's name.

"Olivia Stewart... Sophie Cook's sister, right? No wonder she got a role too."

Sophie clenched her fists, anger boiling within her. She pushed the door open, silencing the room instantly.

"Oh, look who’s back! The next big star!" one of her roommates said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Sophie ignored their half-hearted claps and forced smiles, her own expression cold and unyielding.

Her eyes fell on a letter from a major film company, offering her a minor role in the same production her sister starred in. A maid role—far from the leading lady she had aspired to be.

Sophie crumpled the letter in frustration. All her bravado about not taking anything less than a lead was now a bitter pill to swallow.

“Guess having a famous sister pays off, huh?” a voice snickered from the corner.

Sophie turned, chin high, eyes fierce. "Maybe you should ask your parents why they didn’t give you a sister like mine."

Her words were a sharp retort, masking her own conflicted feelings. She despised Olivia yet had to leverage her sister's name to maintain her standing. Life had a cruel sense of irony.

And so, Sophie Cook, with all her inner turmoil, continued to walk the path she had chosen, determined to rewrite her own story, even if it meant playing second fiddle for now.
