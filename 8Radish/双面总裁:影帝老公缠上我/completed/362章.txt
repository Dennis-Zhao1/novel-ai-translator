As soon as the nurse finished her frantic plea, everyone snapped to attention. Olivia Stewart shot up from her chair, nearly knocking it over in her haste. "Where is he? Hurry, hurry!"

The nurse took a deep breath, steadying herself. "They've already taken him to the lab for a blood test!"

Dr. Mitchell, who was overseeing young Tommy's care, was standing by, his fingers against Tommy's cooling skin. The child's pulse was barely there, just a faint signal on the monitor.

Suddenly, the heart monitor shrieked, the once gentle wave flattening out entirely. "Start CPR, now!" Even Dr. Mitchell, who had seen countless emergencies, couldn't keep the urgency out of his voice.

Isabella Peterson clenched her fists, eyes narrowing at the nurse who was still standing by the door. "Get that donor here immediately!" Isabella knew the blood test results would take too long.

Olivia caught Isabella's determined look and nodded. In this critical moment, she agreed with Isabella's drastic decision.

Soon, a young woman in her twenties was brought in. Her eyes filled with tears as she saw Tommy, pale as a sheet. She nearly collapsed at the sight. No one had time to question her reaction.

Isabella stepped forward, helping the woman stand, her gaze piercing. "Are you RH-negative?"

The woman nodded, biting her lip.

"If you can save that child, name your price. But if you lied about your blood type and something goes wrong, you won't see tomorrow's sunrise," Isabella warned, her voice low and threatening.

"I understand," the woman replied quickly, rolling up her sleeve. "Take as much as you need. Just save him."

After performing a round of CPR, Tommy's heart showed a faint rhythm again. Dr. Mitchell wiped the sweat off his brow, glancing at Isabella. "Are you sure about a direct transfusion? What if—"

Isabella cut him off with a cold stare. "Can you guarantee he'll make it to the test results? Can he wait that long?"

Dr. Mitchell hesitated, frowning. "But—"

Usually, in such dire moments, they would take such a risk. But this was Isabella's son they were talking about!

Isabella's icy gaze pinned Dr. Mitchell in place. "Stop hesitating! Start the transfusion! I'll take responsibility if anything happens."

With that assurance, Dr. Mitchell moved quickly, prepping the woman for the transfusion. The deep red blood flowed through the thin plastic tube, a lifeline into the tangle of machines, and finally into Tommy's tiny body.

Four hundred milliliters went by quickly, absorbed like raindrops on a parched field, seemingly making no difference. Dr. Mitchell looked at the woman again.

Her expression was serene, and she nodded slightly. "Keep going," she murmured. "Just keep taking it."

Eight hundred milliliters later, the woman's blood filled Tommy's veins, and the heart monitor showed more activity. "He's stabilizing! Tommy's pulling through!" Dr. Mitchell announced, an edge of relief in his voice.

But concern flickered as he looked at the woman. Most people could only safely donate four hundred milliliters at a time. This frail-looking woman had already given eight hundred—could she handle more?

The woman heard the doctor’s relieved exclamation and managed a faint smile, her eyes finding Tommy’s bed. Through blurred tears, love softened her gaze.

"Keep going," she whispered, her voice small. "If it saves him, don't stop."

Minutes ticked by, and Tommy's face, once ghostly, regained a hint of color. Twelve hundred milliliters—that was the limit for any donor. Beyond that, it risked serious harm.

Before Dr. Mitchell could say anything, the woman crumpled to the floor. Olivia rushed to support her head, firmly instructing the doctor, "No more! I want to save my child, but not at the cost of another life!"

Her voice cracked with pain.

"I...I'm...fine," the woman mumbled, barely conscious, struggling to form words. "Save...him...please..."

The doctor looked between Olivia and the woman, torn. No one wanted to lose a child, but could they let another life slip away?

Olivia glanced at Tommy's recovering face, then at the woman's pale, unconscious form, and decided, "Stop the transfusion!"

Dr. Mitchell quickly removed the needle from the woman and had her moved to a bed for recovery, administering a special blood-restoring serum.

Sitting beside Tommy, Olivia stroked his cold cheek. "Tommy, you’re going to pull through, right?"

Almost as if in response, the heart monitor's beeps began to slow, the line threatening to flatten again. "What’s happening?" Olivia asked, panic rising.

Dr. Mitchell frowned. "His organs were damaged from blood loss. We've temporarily restored heart function, but the sudden stop in blood supply...and if his brain lacks blood for too long, there could be permanent damage or worse."

Olivia sank to the floor, whispering in disbelief, "How can this be?"

Isabella's eyes locked onto Dr. Mitchell. "If we keep drawing from the woman, what happens?"

"She might not survive," he replied gravely.

Both Olivia and Isabella fell silent. The woman had volunteered to save their child, but how could they ignore her life for Tommy's?

Without more blood, Tommy might die. But if they kept drawing from the woman, she might never wake up.

Olivia stared at the weakening monitor, forcing back tears. "Is there a blood serum for Tommy?"

"We’ve given it, but he’s too young to recover quickly after such loss," the doctor explained.

Isabella abruptly ordered, "Bring her back. Resume the transfusion."

Olivia grabbed Isabella's arm. "Do you realize what you're saying?"

Isabella looked at Olivia's weary face, a softness in her eyes. "I know you want Tommy to wake up. I know you can't bear to harm another life. So let me be the villain."

"No! You fool!" Olivia slapped Isabella. "If she dies, you'll go to jail! What about me? What about our twins?"

"I don't want to lose any of you," she cried, finally breaking down.

"Bam!"

The emergency room door swung open again, and the breathless nurse returned, this time stepping aside to let in a group of doctors in white coats carrying sterile boxes.

Dr. Mitchell lit up with hope. "The blood bank came through! The blood's here!"

Olivia collapsed into Isabella's arms. "Did you hear? The blood's here. Tommy’s going to be okay!"

"Yes," Isabella murmured, holding Olivia tight. Heaven had indeed smiled down on them.

"Let's wait outside and leave this to the doctors," Isabella gently suggested, guiding Olivia out.

Coco, their youngest, trailed behind, his little face serious and lips pressed tight.

Once in the hallway, Isabella sat Olivia down, and only then did Olivia realize her younger son had witnessed everything.

She reached for him, her voice tinged with guilt. "Coco..."

Coco approached but didn't go for a hug. Instead, he looked up at her, saying seriously, "Mom, you need to rest. Don’t worry about me. You did the right thing. If that lady died because of Tommy, he wouldn’t be happy."

Her young son’s words left Olivia both chagrined and proud.

Coco leaned against her knees, patting her hand reassuringly. "Tommy will be okay!"

Despite his age, Coco rarely showed such affection. His earnest comfort made Olivia feel both grateful and embarrassed.

She realized she had to be stronger, inspired by her son’s resilience. The Peterson genes seemed to be quite remarkable indeed!
