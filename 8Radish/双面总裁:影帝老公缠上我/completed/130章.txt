Title: The Unspoken Rift

For five long years, Olivia Stewart and Sophie Cook had been sisters, leaning on each other through thick and thin. But this time, their argument had hit Olivia right in her soft spot, leaving her defenses shattered. After everything that had happened, they ended up hugging it out in the bathroom, their tears washing away the tension, restoring their bond.

Once they left the bathroom, Olivia was back to her usual warm, big-sister self. She wiped away Sophie's tears, saying, "Come on, stop crying. You don’t want puffy eyes, do you? Go take a break and come back when you're feeling better."

Olivia accompanied Sophie to ask for a leave from the director, Mr. Wang. Once Sophie was out of sight, Olivia's gentle smile vanished, replaced by a stern expression. Her usual warm aura was now as chilly as an arctic breeze.

Amy Green, who was passing by, stopped dead in her tracks at the sight of Olivia's icy demeanor. Her usual cheeky grin froze. "Whoa, Olivia! Who borrowed money from you and didn’t pay it back?"

Without missing a beat, Olivia replied, "Tell Mr. Wang I've got an emergency and need to head home."

And with that, she was off.

Amy's first instinct was not to find Mr. Wang but to rush into the luxury RV of their mutual friend, Tyler. "Boss, we’ve got a problem! Olivia just stormed off, looking like she’s ready to explode. Did you sneak out last night without telling her?"

Tyler, engrossed in his computer screen, shot Amy a look that could freeze fire and kicked her to the corner. "You said Olivia what?"

Amy, nursing her sore side, reported honestly, "She left in a huff. I’m not sure what happened, but based on past experience, you should probably go make it right!"

Tyler didn’t need to be told twice. "Drive!"

Amy scrambled to the driver’s seat, and the RV roared to life, speeding away from the set.

Meanwhile, on set, Mr. Wang was barking orders through a megaphone, but his leading stars were nowhere to be found. His assistant rushed over, saying, "Mr. Wang, Olivia and Tyler just left without a word."

What? Both of them? Without saying anything?

These two are going to be the death of me, Mr. Wang thought, hurling the megaphone to the ground in frustration. "That's it for today, folks. Take the day off!"

Olivia was in a frenzy by the time she reached their mansion, bursting into the grand hall. "Isabella Peterson! Get out here!"

Lucas Wright, their elderly but spry caretaker, darted out. A tuft of white hair bobbed comically on his head like a feather. His wrinkled face lit up with a smile. "Olivia! You’re home early. Hungry? I can fix you something to eat."

"No, thanks," Olivia waved him off. "Where’s Isabella?"

"The young master is out on business. If it's urgent, I can call him."

Olivia hesitated. "No, it’s fine."

Isabella had been busy lately, always leaving with her in the morning. His tech startup had him swamped, no doubt. If he was in a meeting, she didn’t want to bother him.

Realizing how impulsive she'd been, Olivia sighed. But still, the thought of Isabella going behind her back was infuriating.

"Never mind, Lucas. I’ll just rest upstairs."

"Of course, Olivia," Lucas replied warmly. "I'll let you know as soon as Isabella gets back."

"Thanks."

As Olivia climbed the stairs, Lucas immediately picked up the phone. "Sir, Olivia's home and looking for you. You'd better hurry back."

Ten minutes later, Isabella rushed in, his presence announced by the lingering scent of cologne. Amy had managed to stop him just in time to remove his disguise, but the scent clung to him.

Lucas appeared again, whispering, "Sir, your bath and a change of clothes are ready in the guest room. Best to wash up before Olivia notices."

Isabella frowned. Why did sneaking around in his own home feel like a covert mission?

"Alright," he muttered, making his way towards the guest room.

Just then, Olivia appeared at the top of the stairs, her eyes like daggers. "Isabella, did you have someone mess with Sophie Cook?"

The question was a punch, and Isabella’s temper flared. "Mess with? She needed a lesson."

"So it was you!" Olivia’s voice rose. "I told you I'd handle it. She's my sister!"

"Your sister?" Isabella scoffed, his eyes darkening. "Does a sister sabotage you at every turn?"

Olivia’s defenses crumbled. She knew everything Isabella said was true.

A tear slipped down her cheek. "Please, just don’t hurt Sophie anymore."

"Hurt her?" Isabella laughed, though his eyes held no humor. "Why do you defend someone who’d betray you?"

Olivia grabbed his arm. "I know you mean well, but Sophie’s sorry. Just… let it go."

With an exasperated sigh, Isabella shook her off and marched upstairs, leaving behind a trail of that all-too-familiar cologne.

The scent hit Olivia, and her blood ran cold. Isabella using cologne meant one thing: he'd been meeting someone important. The last time had ended in a fight over a missed meeting with a female client.

Was he meeting her again?

The thought gnawed at Olivia, her heart sinking. Was she losing him?

That night, they remained cold and distant, not speaking a word.

By morning, Isabella was gone, leaving Olivia staring at the empty staircase, tears threatening to spill.

Maybe she should have seen this coming. But she didn’t expect it to be so soon.

Regardless, Olivia vowed silently, even if he grew tired of her, she wouldn’t leave until their story was over. Not until the final scene of their movie played out.
