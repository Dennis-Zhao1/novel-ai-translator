Title: The Mystery of Little Tom

Olivia Stewart burst out laughing, tears shimmering on her cheeks. "Isabella Peterson, since you know about the child, you've definitely looked into where he is, right?" she asked hopefully, her tear-washed eyes shining brightly as she gazed up at Isabella.

Isabella couldn't help but be charmed by Olivia's hopeful look. She gently patted Olivia's head and whispered, "Yeah."

"Then tell me, where is he? Is he doing well?" Olivia jumped up eagerly, accidentally bumping into Isabella's chin. She winced, tears welling up again.

"Easy there, little one," Isabella chided gently, soothing Olivia's forehead with care.

Olivia pouted, "He's our child! How can I not be anxious?"

Isabella couldn't help but smile at Olivia's earnestness. She leaned down and gave her a quick peck on the lips. "He's doing just fine, don't worry!"

"Can we bring him back?" Olivia asked, her hopeful eyes dimming quickly. She whispered, "Or maybe not. Just take me to see him from afar."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Hmm?"

Olivia sniffled. "After all, I was the one who abandoned him back then."

"My adoptive father came to me before," Olivia continued, "He said the child was alive and demanded half a million for his whereabouts. I gave him the money, but..."

Isabella frowned, displeased. "Why didn't you tell me?"

"I wanted to ask for your help but was afraid..." Olivia choked up, unable to continue.

Isabella pulled her closer. "Silly girl."

"I really am silly!" Olivia wiped her eyes. "My adoptive father said he gave the child away because I was pregnant before marriage. Only today did I find out he sold him! How could he do that?"

Isabella's eyes darkened momentarily. It seemed James Cook needed a change in his retirement plans.

He quickly regained his composure, gently patting Olivia. "Let's not dwell on the past. As long as the child is okay, that's what matters, right?"

"Yeah," Olivia nodded, her voice thoughtful. "If he's happy with his adoptive parents, we should just watch from a distance and not disturb their happiness. But if he's not, I want to bring him back and find a way to earn his forgiveness."

Seeing Olivia's humble resolve, Isabella felt a pang in his heart. "Olivia, the day I proposed to you and rushed off wasn't because of the fifty percent share. I got news about the child. I kept it from you to avoid affecting your emotions." Isabella finally confessed, his voice full of regret.

Olivia smiled softly. "The child is, of course, the most important."

When Isabella had mentioned leaving because of business, Olivia understood but couldn't help feeling a bit down. Now, she felt completely at ease.

"Is the child cute? Do you have a photo?" Olivia's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Isabella replied softly, "You've seen him before. He's at the Children's Home in Goldtown."

"He's at the home?" Olivia gasped. "Who is he?"

Seeing Isabella's bittersweet smile, Olivia's eyes widened. "Could it be...Tom?"

"You two really are connected. Spot on!" Isabella chuckled.

"So Tom is my child!" Olivia's face lit up with a sweet smile, which quickly froze. "But he has a congenital heart condition!"

"Yes, but don't worry. It's under control," Isabella reassured, squeezing Olivia's hand gently.

Olivia's expression grew serious. "If I'm not mistaken, Tom also shows signs of being withdrawn."

Isabella sighed. "You see through everything! I wanted to wait before telling you to avoid worrying you."

"Tom has had a thorough check-up. His heart condition is operable with an over eighty percent success rate. As for his personality, the psychologist suggests that being in a familiar environment with familiar people might help. So, I've temporarily placed him back at the children's home."

Olivia beamed, "He's still there? Let's go see him!"

Isabella playfully tapped her nose. "You're always in such a rush! Don't worry, the headmistress is taking good care of him. Once you're rested and ready, I'll take you."

"I know, I won't rush to have him call me 'Mom' until he's ready!" Olivia giggled, then paused. "He used to call me 'Sister,' though!"

Realizing she'd been downgraded in status, Olivia covered her face in embarrassment.

"Next time, just have him call you 'Auntie,'" Isabella suggested with a chuckle.

Olivia nodded, "Makes sense."

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief, glad to finally resolve the awkward naming situation.

The next day, under Olivia's relentless persuasion, Isabella took her to the children's home.

"Tom!" Olivia called, her arms wide open and a brilliant smile on her face.

Tom glanced at Olivia shyly and hid behind the headmistress.

Olivia's heart ached, but her smile softened, "Tom, it's me, your sister Fruit! Remember? I used to bring you candy and toys. Look, I've got something for you!"

She pulled out a toy car, waving it in front of Tom.

"Sister Fruit!" Tom called out sweetly, toddling over to Olivia, not to take the toy but to hug her lightly.

"I remember now, you're Sister Fruit!" he said.

Olivia hugged him tightly, tears glistening in her eyes.

"You shouldn't carry him. Let me," Isabella's voice interrupted, extending his arms.

Tom's bright eyes dimmed, and he turned away, full of resistance.

Olivia shot Isabella a look, signaling him to be patient.

Isabella softened his tone, "You're a big boy now, right? Your Auntie Fruit is expecting a baby, and carrying you might tire her and harm the baby, okay?"

Tom quickly scrambled down. "Sister Fruit, I don't want you to carry me. I don't want anyone to!"

With that, he darted off.

"Tom!" Olivia called, chasing after him.

"Olivia, watch your step!" Isabella shouted after her.

Suddenly, his phone rang. Isabella checked it, his brow furrowing before he stepped outside to answer, "What's up?"

"Sir!" Lucas Wright's elderly voice came through. "The paternity test results show that young master Tom is... related to you."

Related? That means he's... Alexander Peterson's child?

Isabella's phone slipped from his hand.

He clenched his fist, pressing it against his forehead, closing his eyes in pain.

After a long moment, he opened his eyes, picked up the phone, and asked, "Are you sure there's no mistake?"

"They conducted the test three times, with me overseeing it!" Lucas's voice was solemn.

Isabella's voice was hoarse. "Who knows about this?"

"Only me, since it was an anonymous test!"

"Good. Take this secret to your grave."

After hanging up, Isabella slammed his fist on the steering wheel.

Tom being Alexander Peterson's child? Impossible!

Even Alexander likely had no idea. Otherwise, he'd never use his own son as bait.

But now, with Tom in his care, Isabella had leverage.

No, that wasn't right. Olivia had been innocent in her relationship with Alexander. How did this child come to be?

The more Isabella thought, the more frustrated he became. He shook his head, trying to clear his mind.

No matter how Tom came to be, he was the child Olivia had for him.

After Olivia played with Tom and watched him nap, she reluctantly left the children's home.

On the way, she asked, "Where's Isabella?"

A staff member replied, "He's in the car!"

Outside, Olivia found Isabella in the car, looking troubled.

She climbed in, concerned. "Isabella, what's wrong?"

"Nothing. Just had some urgent business to handle. It's resolved now, so nothing to worry about."

Sensing his reluctance to talk, Olivia didn't press further.

Her most important task was to take care of herself and their three children, providing Isabella with a secure home front.

Buckling her seatbelt, Olivia smiled sweetly at Isabella. "Let's go!"
