Olivia Stewart stood in front of the display case, her eyes fixed on the stunning wedding dress inside. She remembered clearly—it was the dress Isabella Peterson had picked out for her after proposing. But on the day she was supposed to try it on, a family emergency had come up, leaving Isabella waiting for hours. That was then...

Lost in thought, Olivia barely noticed when Isabella Peterson appeared beside her, wrapping his arms around her gently from behind. The warmth of his embrace stirred something in her heart as she interlocked her fingers with his.

They had been through so much together. This relationship had taught them both to cherish what they had. Olivia turned her head slightly and said to Isabella, "I'll go with this one."

"Perfect!" Isabella's breath tickled her neck as he whispered, "We really are on the same wavelength! I had my eye on this one too."

"Who said we're married already?" Olivia playfully swatted his hand, though the sweetness of the moment was undeniable.

"Do you not understand what it means to be a couple?" Isabella teased, leaning even closer. "Maybe I should give you a lesson?"

"Get out of here!" Olivia said with a laugh, trying to push him away. But his arms only tightened around her, his warmth spreading through her thin shirt and into her heart.

Realizing she couldn't escape, Olivia closed her eyes, letting Isabella's lips claim hers in a passionate kiss.

With the dress chosen, wedding plans moved into full swing. They decided on May 20th for their big day. The whole house buzzed with excitement, staff bustling about in preparation.

Olivia and Isabella were well-known in their city, and any announcement would certainly cause a media frenzy. But Olivia wanted their wedding to be about them, not a spectacle for the public. Isabella, concerned about her well-being, agreed to keep things under wraps until the wedding day, when the news would be shared on their company’s website.

Despite being a mom, Olivia felt like any bride-to-be—happy, nervous, and full of anticipation. Isabella handled most of the preparations, wanting her to relax. All she had to do was pick her favorites from the samples brought to her.

During this busy time, Isabella was around less, as he wanted to finish up work before their honeymoon. This left Olivia with some unexpected free time.

Grace Martin, a family friend, would bring soup every day, leaving it at the door and taking back the empty container from the day before. Olivia never drank the soup, yet Grace continued her routine, as if it were her life’s purpose.

The weather turned unpredictable as the rainy season approached. One morning, dark clouds rolled in, and a torrential downpour followed, complete with thunder. The rain continued for hours, showing no sign of stopping.

Olivia, teaching her kids to draw, felt a strange unease as she watched the storm outside. Unable to shake it off, she left the playroom for her study, hoping music would calm her nerves. She absentmindedly opened the surveillance feed, checking for Grace Martin’s arrival.

The cameras showed only the empty yard and the leftover soup container. As the minutes passed, Olivia convinced herself Grace wouldn’t come in such weather, though she kept checking back.

After lunch, she played board games with the twins but lost repeatedly, distracted by her thoughts. Even the kids noticed her distraction, teasing her for being “mommy-brained.”

Finally, giving up, she let the kids play with their older sibling, Kael, who had come to join them. Relieved, Olivia returned to her study, drawn once again to the computer screen.

The rain poured on, and Olivia couldn’t help but feel disappointed when Grace didn’t show. Was she hoping to see her struggle through the rain? She scolded herself for such thoughts, trying to shake off the strange mix of emotions swirling inside her.

As evening approached, the rain eased a little. Olivia was about to shut down her computer when, on the screen, a figure appeared, holding an umbrella...
