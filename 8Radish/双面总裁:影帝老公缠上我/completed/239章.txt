Olivia Stewart had vanished.

"You wouldn't understand the feeling of being betrayed by family!"

"Thank you, Skyler, but I also hate you!"

"Why did you have to tear away the facade and see me so raw and bleeding?"

Skyler gazed deeply into Olivia Stewart's eyes.

"Because I can't just stand by and watch you be tortured to death by so-called family!"

"You need to go through the pain to be reborn!"

Olivia Stewart shoved Skyler away and bolted out of the room. Skyler gave a quick nod to the security guard to follow her. Then, he hurried into the makeup room, where Amy Green helped him remove his disguise. Revealing his true identity to Olivia Stewart now would only make her feel deceived. She couldn't handle another blow.

By the time Skyler reappeared at the entrance of the billion-dollar film studio, he had transformed back into Isabella Peterson.

Unfamiliar with the building, Olivia Stewart, overwhelmed with emotion, forgot elevators even existed. She ran wildly through the stairwells, searching for a release for her chaotic feelings. The security guard kept a safe distance, updating Isabella Peterson on her location.

As Olivia Stewart reached the ground floor, she spotted Isabella Peterson standing there, cool and collected, smiling warmly and opening his arms. Without a second thought, she launched herself at him.

The force of her impact made Isabella's chest ache, but it was real and warm. "Isabella Peterson, from now on, you're all I have left," she sobbed. It was then that Olivia Stewart allowed herself to be truly vulnerable.

Like many women, she could only cry freely in front of the person she loved most. Her tears flowed like a faucet, soaking Isabella's designer shirt, but his heart felt full. Isabella gently stroked Olivia's hair, a tender smile on his lips.

"You have me, and that's enough. I'm your whole world, and I'll bring the world to you."

His words, haughty yet reassuring, were music to Olivia's ears, wrapping her heart in sweetness like sugar dissolving in warm water.

Eventually, Olivia calmed down, lifting her head from Isabella's chest. Upon seeing the mess she'd made, she crinkled her nose apologetically. Isabella didn't mind. He tapped her nose playfully.

"Had enough of crying?"

Olivia dipped her head, sneaking a glance at Isabella's expression from the corner of her eye. Seeing he wasn't upset, she bit her lip gently. This was the same guy who once fussed about a single touch, demanding a towel to clean up. Now, it seemed, spending time with her had lowered his standards.

Isabella chuckled at her mischievous look, wiping her tear-streaked face with a tissue. "My little raccoon."

Olivia giggled and pointed at his chest. "Old dirty tiger!"

Isabella's zodiac sign was the tiger, and Olivia was teasing him back. But she hit several nerves at once. "You dare call me old? And dirty?"

Who made him dirty? Who?

Realizing she'd poked the tiger, Olivia turned to flee. Isabella, with a swift motion, encircled her waist and hoisted her up like she weighed nothing, striding away.

In public!

"Isabella Peterson, put me down!" Olivia shouted in embarrassed anger.

Ignoring her protests, Isabella tossed Olivia into his car, rolling up the windows. Inside, a playful spat ensued...

Back at their castle home, Olivia was carried in, wrapped in Isabella's coat, fast asleep. The staff greeted them with bows and smiles, used to these displays of affection but still unable to suppress their own grins.

Olivia, exhausted, had no idea how she got back to her room. Isabella tucked her in carefully before heading to his study to make a call.

"Have you found Sophie Cook?"

"Great! Make sure she ends up in the middle of the ocean!"

Hanging up, a shadow passed over Isabella's eyes. Olivia was too kind, sparing Sophie Cook's life. But Sophie wouldn't be grateful. She'd seize any chance to harm Olivia again. Olivia might forgive, but Isabella had no such mercy. He wouldn't let anyone who hurt Olivia remain a threat.

With Sophie Cook out of the picture, life settled into a calmer rhythm. The old man, Nathan Peterson, hadn't made any moves yet, but Isabella remained vigilant. He continued to personally escort Olivia to the set, then transformed into Skyler in his trailer, keeping a watchful eye over everything.

Despite the precautions, a few days later, something went wrong.

One morning, Isabella returned from changing to find Olivia missing. Alarmed, he interrogated a nearby guard, "Where's Olivia Stewart?"

"She went to the restroom a while ago."

"How long?"

"About half an hour."

Isabella's brow furrowed, "And she hasn't come out?"

The guard stammered, "I-I didn't notice!"

Panic gripped Isabella. He rushed to the restroom, finding it empty. In the mere thirty minutes he'd been gone, Olivia had vanished. And in such a public place! Who knew his routine so well? Who meant harm to Olivia?

Isabella reviewed the surveillance footage, watching as Olivia entered the restroom. Minutes later, a masked cleaner wheeled out a large black trash bag. His fist smashed the screen, sending shards scattering to the floor. His hand was bloody, but he didn't care.

Why hadn't he thought of posting a female guard by the restroom? Isabella's eyes blazed. "Who let that woman in?"

A guard hesitantly stepped forward, "She was a regular cleaner with clearance."

"Find her, now!"

The guards returned empty-handed, trembling. "I'm sorry, sir. The cleaner's already been silenced."

"Useless!" Isabella kicked the nearest guard in frustration.

"Deploy everyone! Find Olivia Stewart or prepare to face me!"

Isabella stormed into his trailer, hacking into the city's traffic cameras, his eyes scanning desperately for any sign of Olivia. Who could have orchestrated such a seamless abduction?

Just then, his phone rang.

"Speak!"

"Sir, we were ambushed while transporting Sophie Cook. She was taken by an unknown group!"

Not Olivia's whereabouts, but troubling news nonetheless. Isabella's brow furrowed. It was as if an unseen net had been cast, tightening around him.

The old man had made his move.

Isabella's bloodshot eyes left the screen as he called his father, Nathan Peterson. The old man's butler answered.

"Hello, Master Peterson."

"Get the old man on the line!"

"He insists you come home if you have something to say."

"Tell him if he harms Olivia, I'll ensure the Peterson legacy ends with me!"

"That ungrateful brat!"

Isabella heard his father's angry curses faintly over the line. Moments later, the old man's voice boomed through the receiver:

"Marry Bianca White or watch that woman die! You can't threaten me. I have Alexander!"

So it was the old man. Cold-blooded to the core. Isabella's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint in them.

"You know Alexander's no match for me."

"Would you really destroy your own brother?"

Isabella hung up.

He'd found the old man's weak spot. Though indifferent to his own son, Nathan Peterson cherished his adopted heir, Alexander, like a prized possession. Just one threat had shaken him.

Hopefully, this would make Nathan hesitate to hurt Olivia.

Isabella immediately arranged for a private flight back to the Peterson estate.

When Olivia Stewart awoke, her mind felt foggy, like it was filled with glue. She vaguely remembered smiling at a cleaning lady as she left the restroom, only to have something damp pressed over her face, and then... darkness.

Kidnapped!

A jolt of fear snapped Olivia awake. She opened her eyes to find a bright blue sky outside, clouds fluffy as cotton candy, closer than she'd ever seen.

The scene was familiar!

Struggling to move her head, she realized she was on a plane!
