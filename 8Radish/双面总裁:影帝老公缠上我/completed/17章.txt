The Troublemaker

"Uh..." Olivia Stewart hesitated. "I have to thank you to get my own stuff back?"

"Can't think of a way? Come back when you do," Isabella Peterson said, tossing the phone back into her drawer.

"Wait!" Olivia blurted out. "Uh… How about I make you coffee?"

"…"

"Cook for you?"

"…"

"Clean your place?" Olivia offered desperately.

Isabella's face darkened. "Olivia, I don't need a maid."

"Then... what do you want?" Olivia asked, genuinely puzzled.

"You," Isabella replied with a mischievous smile.

Olivia's face flushed crimson. "Isabella, I'm serious!" she insisted.

"So am I," Isabella countered smoothly.

Taking advantage of the situation, Olivia thought with exasperation. "How about I give you a kiss, and you let me make a quick call to let everyone know I'm okay?"

Isabella's eyes sparkled with mischief. "So generous? Who do you need to reassure?"

Olivia's gaze shifted nervously. "Uh… I was just saying."

Isabella's dark eyes turned thoughtful. "I'll consider it."

Taking a deep breath, Olivia steeled herself and quickly pecked Isabella on the cheek—a quick, barely-there gesture.

"That was half-hearted," Isabella commented.

Gritting her teeth, Olivia leaned in again, this time planting a more decisive kiss.

Isabella pointed to his lips.

Oh, come on!

Olivia clutched the hem of her dress tightly, her teeth gnawing at her lower lip as she glared at Isabella, both frustrated and resigned. She thought to herself, "He's kissed me countless times before, so what's one more?"

Yet she couldn't deny there was a big difference between being kissed and initiating it herself. Olivia glanced at the phone, then at Isabella's teasingly inviting lips, hesitating. Where had she found the courage when she first borrowed a kiss from him?

"Maybe you kiss me instead, and then give me the phone?" Olivia suggested hopefully.

Isabella gave her a mischievous look as if ready to toss the phone back in the drawer.

"No!" Olivia exclaimed.

Screw it!

Olivia took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and pressed her lips to Isabella's in a quick, fleeting kiss. But Isabella was ready for her evasion. As soon as her lips brushed against his, Isabella seized the opportunity, holding her in place and turning the tables.

Oh my gosh, I can't breathe!

This troublemaker! How could he bully her like this? So infuriating!

Outside, Lucas Wright quietly closed the study door, giving them some privacy.

Half an hour later, Olivia was panting for breath, her face flushed as she finally managed to speak, "Isabella, can I have my phone now?"

This little thing was truly stingy, not willing to give an inch. Isabella reached out, gently grazing Olivia's rosy cheek with his fingers, his voice low and mesmerizing. "Admit it, you enjoyed it too, didn't you?"

Boom—Olivia's face turned a deep shade of red.

Shameless!

She could say that it was just his technique that had her reacting normally, right?

Gathering her strength, Olivia pushed Isabella away, extending her hand impatiently. "I want my phone!"

Isabella smirked, producing her jelly-cased phone from his palm as if by magic.

Olivia's eyes lit up with joy as she reached for it, only for Isabella to close his fingers around it, leaving her grasping at air.

"What's the idea, Isabella? You said you'd give it back!"

"Did I?" Isabella teased with a smug grin.

"You said you'd consider it!" Olivia protested.

"I did, and I think it's safer with me," Isabella replied, his smile wicked.

Ugh, fooled again!

Jerk!

Stomping her foot, Olivia lunged, trying to snatch it back. Isabella's long arm held the phone high above her reach, leaving her flailing below.

"Isabella, you shameless jerk!"

Olivia's fighting spirit flared as she stretched on tiptoe, reaching for Isabella's arm, determined to retrieve what was hers.

For once, this little thing was coming to him willingly!

Isabella watched her determinedly climbing frame with amusement, his dark eyes flickering with interest. He leaned back slightly, lowering his arm just enough for Olivia to almost reach it.

Just a little bit more!

Olivia saw hope and redoubled her efforts, pressing herself against Isabella, oblivious to her proximity as she stretched higher.

"Isabella, give it to me!"

"If you don't, I'll bite you!"

Outside, Lucas Wright, eavesdropping with the door slightly ajar, wiped his brow. Who would've thought Olivia, normally so gentle, could be this fierce? Hang in there, master!

Inside the room, the phone suddenly rang with a cheerful tune, interrupting their tussle.

Both of them paused, glancing at the screen where the caller ID read "Madman."

That flamboyant guy? He dared to call!

Isabella's expression darkened, his eyes glinting like shards of ice.

Seeing it was Ethan King calling, Olivia became more desperate, lunging for the phone with all her might.

Isabella, momentarily caught off guard, found himself tackled to the carpet, Olivia sprawled on top of him, still reaching for the phone. "Give it to me! Now! Or else!"

"So, you were planning to reassure him?" Isabella asked, his voice dangerously calm.

Olivia, ever honest, replied, "Ethan King must be worried sick looking for me. I have to let him know I'm okay!"

Isabella's lips curled into a sly smile. "I'll handle it for you."

Olivia panicked. "Isabella, don't do anything reckless!"

But Isabella easily flipped the situation, pinning Olivia beneath him on the carpet, rendering her helpless.

Propping himself up, he silenced her protests with a hand over her mouth, swiping the screen to answer the call.

In a desperate attempt, Olivia lunged forward—only to watch helplessly as her phone flew from her grasp.

Olivia was heartbroken.

Isabella, meanwhile, was captivated by the sight before him, feeling a dry heat in his throat.

"Grunt—"

He distinctly heard himself swallow.

The sudden movement startled Olivia, who looked down, let out a shriek, and quickly covered Isabella's eyes.

"Oh my gosh! You can't look!"

Dang it, in her wild lunge, her neckline had snagged on his shirt's metal emblem, leaving a gaping tear.

This was unacceptable!

Such a breach of modesty, and in front of this scoundrel!

Isabella, though blindfolded, caught a whiff of a subtle, pure scent that filled him with an inexplicable joy.

A tender feeling, like a swiftly growing vine, spread through his body, reaching every corner of his being.

The air around them seemed to heat up, as if ready to ignite at any moment.

"Ah—"

Olivia suddenly sensed something amiss, like a jolt of electricity, and quickly pulled back, pushing Isabella away.

"Get off... get off me..."

As she struggled to free herself, Isabella effortlessly pulled her back, pinning her hands above her head with a mischievous grin, leaning in closer.

"Trying to run after starting a fire, hm?"

With his face so dangerously close, Olivia was thoroughly flustered.

"Isabella, please, don't..."

"I heard women mean the opposite of what they say," he teased.

"No, no, that's not..."

Olivia turned her face away, her body trembling slightly. She couldn't bring herself to meet Isabella's deep, mischievous gaze.

As much as she wanted to give in, she had to hold her ground.

"Heh, such a coy little thing!"

Isabella lowered his head, capturing her lips with his.

"Ah, Isabella, you jerk! You rogue! Stop it!"

Isabella raised an eyebrow, releasing her slightly, relishing this wolf-and-lamb game.

Olivia took the opportunity to struggle, clawing at Isabella's face without hesitation.

"Ow—naughty kitty, misbehaving will get you punished!"

Isabella dodged deftly, capturing her hand with ease, his voice low and husky, intoxicatingly charming.

Olivia froze, caught in his deep, dark eyes like a whirlpool.

Those black eyes, like a vast vortex, drawing her in.

Olivia found herself staring at Isabella's handsome face, inching closer—the chiseled features, the deep-set eyes, the strong nose, the slightly curled lips—so striking, so handsome.

She forgot to struggle, forgot to resist.

All she could hear was her own pounding heartbeat.

Isabella gently brushed her nose with his, planting a soft kiss on her lips like a dragonfly skimming the water.

This guy, like a poppy.

Addictive, yet irresistibly alluring!

"No, Isabella..."

Olivia's cheeks were flushed, though a small part of her mind remained clear, she couldn't help but savor the moment.

"You little thing! You can't escape my grasp!" Isabella declared triumphantly.
