Chapter 1: Turning the Page

"That's better!" Isabella Peterson's tone softened a bit. "Remember what you said. Starting tomorrow, behave yourself and stop clinging to Olivia Stewart, or I'll send you away! Also, act like you're getting along well with me, so Olivia Stewart won't worry!"

Tongtong nodded vigorously.

Isabella waved her hand dismissively. "Alright, off to bed with you!"

Tongtong cast a lingering glance at Olivia, then a cautious one at Isabella, before quietly whispering, "Goodnight, Uncle!" as he reached the door.

The next day, when Olivia Stewart opened her eyes, it was already afternoon.

"You're awake?" Isabella's handsome face loomed large before her, his voice unexpectedly gentle.

How long had it been since she'd seen this tender side of Isabella Peterson?

Olivia felt like she was dreaming, her big, bewildered eyes blinking repeatedly.

Isabella was taken aback by her doe-like gaze, and he couldn't help but lean down, his lips brushing against her soft, jelly-like ones.

It was a fleeting touch.

Isabella restrained his intense desire, not wanting to overwhelm Olivia for too long. After all, the little one was still hungry, which he hadn't forgotten.

Olivia was left bewildered by Isabella's actions, feeling like everything had changed after just a nap.

No, no, no, everything had reverted to how it used to be!

Wasn't that too surreal?

Olivia looked uncertainly at Isabella and whispered, "Isabella..."

"Are you hungry? Let's eat first!"

Not letting Olivia finish, Isabella scooped her up with one swift motion, propping her against the headboard, a tray already prepared on the nightstand. He unveiled the lid with a flourish. "Look, all your favorites!"

Olivia's stomach had been growling, and the aroma of food made her mouth water. She couldn't resist digging in with the spoon Isabella offered, savoring every bite.

Watching Olivia eat so contentedly, Isabella's eyes softened.

It seemed he had made the right decision.

Why hold onto past grievances?

Olivia's happiness was what truly mattered!

Isabella chided himself silently, reflecting on his recent actions. What had he been doing all this time? Foolishness!

"Take it slow, don't choke," Isabella advised gently.

After finishing the generous bowl of food, Olivia let out a contented sigh and set the spoon down, glancing sheepishly at Isabella.

Isabella chuckled, patting her back. "Feeling better?"

Olivia nodded, her cheeks flushed, but another hiccup escaped her lips. "Hic—"

The sound was so prolonged that Olivia wished she could bury herself in embarrassment.

"Hehehe..."

Isabella's deep laughter resonated above Olivia's head, each chuckle vibrating in her ears.

How long had it been since she heard him laugh like this?

Was he trying to leave her with some fond memories before the inevitable break?

A hint of sadness flickered in Olivia's eyes as she looked away, her long lashes concealing her emotions.

"Here, have some more soup."

Isabella offered a bowl of fragrant vegetable soup to Olivia's lips.

Olivia sipped it gingerly, finding it just the right temperature and flavor—light, fresh, not too salty or greasy, exactly to her liking.

She obediently drank the soup, savoring each mouthful.

"Good girl!" Isabella praised as if she were a child, even tenderly wiping away a drop of soup from Olivia's lips with a napkin.

Olivia quietly relished this last moment of gentleness.

The more Isabella showered her with affection, the colder and more bitter her heart felt.

It was as if someone was slicing her heart with a knife and sprinkling salt into the wound.

Isabella summoned a servant to clear the dishes, then gently tousled Olivia's hair, his voice still tender and indulgent. "Do you want to nap a bit more?"

Olivia shook her head slightly, though her mind screamed: Isabella, if you want to break up or send me and Tongtong away, just give it to me straight! This slow torture is unbearable; I can't take it anymore!

"Rest a bit more. You've been so tired lately; look, you've lost weight!" Isabella pinched her cheek playfully. "Don't worry about the kids; they're all doing well."

The mention of the kids finally drew Olivia's attention.

However, Isabella offered no further explanation.

After waiting a moment and seeing Isabella had no intention of continuing, Olivia bit her lip and asked, "What do you plan to do about Tongtong?"

"Tongtong's recovering well now. I'm thinking of either enrolling him in a regular preschool in Gold City or hiring a special tutor to teach him at home. It's up to you to decide! I heard he used to be quite clingy, but your illness scared him straight. Now he's behaving himself, doing everything on his own!"

Isabella rambled on as if all his previous indifference and dislike had never existed.

He seemed every bit the perfect father now!

Yet, Olivia had only fainted, not lost her memory. The words Isabella had spoken just before she lost consciousness were still fresh in her mind.

He had said: Tongtong is Alexander Peterson's child!

Back then, she'd had a memory lapse, and if Isabella had said it so confidently, he surely must have verified it. Faced with such a harsh reality, she had no choice but to accept it!

But why, after waking up, did Isabella act like he had amnesia and never mention it again?

Was he trying to sweep it under the rug?

Given his fastidious nature, how could he possibly do that?

If he could, why had they argued repeatedly, engaged in countless cold wars, and why had he fled abroad under the guise of business trips for weeks on end?

Olivia let out a self-deprecating laugh.

Even she couldn't come to terms with the realization that her child belonged to another man, let alone Isabella Peterson.

Olivia pondered for a moment, then looked at Isabella with a serious and earnest gaze.

"Isabella, since we can't change certain facts, I hope you can be honest and upfront about your stance. Even if we have to part ways, it should be clear and straightforward!"

This woman!

If he didn't compromise, she would choose to sever ties with him!

Bitterness welled up in Isabella's heart.

His handsome face darkened, and he spoke with a hint of displeasure, "Olivia, I come back, and you immediately talk about breaking up. Are you planning to abandon me and the twins?"

Olivia's eyes quickly reddened as she turned her face away. "I can't bear to leave the twins either! But if it comes to that, I have no choice. At least they have you, Butler Joy, and many others to care for them. But Tongtong is different. His childhood has been unfortunate; he's a sensitive and insecure child. Besides me, he has no one else. So, I must fulfill my duties as a mother!"

"Who's stopping you from fulfilling your duties?" Isabella raised his voice. "Didn't I just bring him back after the treatment ended?"

"Isabella! Aren't you tired of dodging the issue?"

Seeing Isabella avoiding the topic, Olivia decided to be direct. "I finally understand why you dislike Tongtong so much! But I don't blame you. Whatever decision you make, I'll respect it. You don't need to force yourself!"

"Who said I don't like Tongtong? He's my first child, so I've been a bit strict, wanting him to succeed too eagerly. I've realized my mistake, okay? My decision is to marry you as soon as possible! You stood me up yesterday at the bridal shop, so you owe me. From now on, your nights belong to me. No more sleeping with the kids!"

Isabella's tone was as domineering as ever.

Seeing his serious demeanor, Olivia almost believed their previous arguments had been just a dream.

But Isabella's bloodshot eyes clearly told her that everything was real and present!

"Isabella, I don't know what prompted you to make this decision, but as I've figured things out, I won't let you suffer like this! I can't abandon Tongtong. Do you really want to raise Alexander Peterson's child for life?"

Isabella's brows furrowed in annoyance. "Who said Tongtong is Alexander Peterson's child?"

Olivia was too stunned to speak.

Was he really contradicting himself?

She looked into Isabella's eyes and saw a flash of pain.

Was he forcing himself to this extent because she refused to give up Tongtong?

Olivia felt a lump in her throat as she whispered, "Isabella..."

"Alright, alright!" Isabella pulled Olivia into his embrace. "I promise, as long as you don't exhaust yourself, I'll let you spoil the kids however you like. I won't get jealous! But your nights are mine!"

Isabella's domineering voice carried a hint of reluctant acceptance.

Olivia's heart ached deeply.

She knew his obsessive cleanliness well, and that made her realize how difficult it was for Isabella to make such a concession!

But why did she have Alexander Peterson's child? If she remembered correctly, her relationship with Alexander had been purely platonic back then. So why was Tongtong his child?

Olivia suddenly broke free from Isabella's embrace, her eyes piercing. "Isabella, did you have a paternity test done for Tongtong?"
