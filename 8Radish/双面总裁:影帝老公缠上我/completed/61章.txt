Olivia Stewart was lounging lazily on the couch, hugging a panda plushie with her chin resting on its head. Her big, bright eyes stared blankly ahead, a picture of pure boredom and lack of energy.

Suddenly, Isabella Peterson barged in, her usually stern face showing no signs of softening. "Didn't you just say you had a stomachache?" she inquired, raising an eyebrow.

"Yeah, a little," Olivia replied, her delicate eyebrows knitting together. Did Isabella not believe her? Or was she just being relentless even now?

"Then why aren't you lying down?" Isabella asked, a hint of impatience in her voice.

"Oh, it's not that bad," Olivia reassured her, trying to downplay it. She preferred just resting against the cushions.

Isabella disappeared for a moment, only to return with a bowl of something dark and syrupy, a heavy sweet smell wafting from it. Olivia wrinkled her nose. "What on earth is that? It smells awful!"

Isabella set the bowl down in front of her and sat backward on a chair, crossing her long legs. "You've never had this before?" she asked, a bit incredulous.

"Nope!"

"Damn it, those women lied to me!" Isabella muttered, picking up the bowl to leave. But Olivia caught her arm.

"What’s going on?" Olivia asked, genuinely curious.

"I asked the maids, and they said if you have cramps, drinking some sweet syrup would help. I asked them to make it extra strong... I didn't know..." Isabella admitted, trailing off.

Olivia couldn't help but laugh, "Isabella, I can't believe you went to ask the maids about this. You're just too cute!"

"Olivia! I lost face because of you, and you're laughing?" Isabella fumed, clearly embarrassed.

Olivia quickly covered her mouth to stifle her laughter. "Okay, okay, I won't laugh. But don't scold them. I've heard sweet syrup can help with cramps too. I just thought you were giving me some awful medicine!"

"Then why did you say you've never tried it?" Isabella pressed, still puzzled.

"Well, I never had the chance before. Sometimes I was still at work when it happened, and I just pushed through it," Olivia explained, her voice growing softer.

"From now on, no pushing through!" Isabella commanded with a tone of authority.

"Okay." Olivia nodded obediently.

"Anytime you feel wronged, you tell me, and I'll stand up for you!"

"What if you're the one making me feel wronged?" Olivia teased.

"Tell me anyway!" Isabella replied firmly, a glint in her eye.

Olivia's lips curled into a smile, revealing bright white teeth that made Isabella's heart skip a beat. It was that smile that had once pulled him back from the brink of despair.

Isabella stirred the syrup with a spoon, the sweet aroma intensifying. "Can you stand this smell?" Olivia asked, trying to hold her breath.

"Not really."

"Then why are you..."

"Here, let me feed you," Isabella said, bringing a spoonful to Olivia's lips.

Olivia hesitated, but seeing Isabella's determined eyes, she relented and took the spoonful. The overly sweet taste spread through her mouth. This was more like syrup pudding than just syrup water!

"Isabella, can I not drink this?" Olivia asked tentatively.

"No way!" Isabella insisted.

"But it's so sweet, my teeth might fall out!" Olivia protested.

"You acting like this is you being spoiled?" Isabella teased. "It's just syrup!"

"You made it too thick, it's like candy!" Olivia complained, crossing her arms and turning away.

"I'm not trying it! I'm not the one with cramps!" Isabella retorted.

Olivia rolled her eyes, exasperated.

Isabella brought another spoonful to Olivia's lips. "Come on, be good, finish it up!"

Reluctantly, Olivia swallowed spoonful after spoonful until the bowl was empty, finally feeling like she'd been granted a pardon.

Isabella rewarded her with a kiss on the forehead and patted her head as if she were a pet. "Good girl, now rest up."

Olivia felt so full of sweetness she thought she might burst. "I want to go for a walk."

"No way. I heard you need to rest more and exercise less during these days. Just stay in and take it easy," Isabella insisted.

"Isabella, it's just a walk. Exercise is good; it helps with recovery. You really need to catch up on your knowledge here. Lying around all day is boring, and I'm not on maternity leave!"

Isabella's eyes locked onto Olivia's. "Do you want to go on maternity leave?"

Olivia playfully punched Isabella's chest. "Can you focus on the main point when listening?"

With that, Isabella opened her arms, offering to carry Olivia downstairs.

Olivia tensed up. "What are you doing?"

"You wanted a walk, right? I'll carry you down," Isabella replied, his eyes twinkling.

"Oh," Olivia relaxed, finally understanding.

Isabella gave her a playful poke on the forehead. "Olivia, what crazy things are you thinking? Can your thoughts be a bit healthier?"

Olivia huffed, rolling her eyes. Who was it that was always thinking about... well, you know what?

Due to her cramps, Olivia became a protected species under Isabella’s care. He stayed by her side almost 24/7, making sure she had her syrup and nutritious meals. After a few days, Olivia felt like her face had rounded out.

"Isabella, you don't have to do all this. Every girl goes through it every month; it's normal. No need to be so tense!"

"Am I tense? I'm just worried about missing out on my perks," Isabella said with a mischievous grin, looking Olivia up and down with a gaze that was both teasing and intense.

That look sent a shiver down Olivia's spine. Now, she wished her cramps would last a little longer to delay what was sure to come afterward.

In an attempt to extend her reprieve, Olivia started eating more salads, but it wasn't very effective. One evening, while Isabella was busy in his study, Olivia sneaked downstairs to grab some ice cream. Just as she was about to take a bite, Isabella's voice boomed behind her. "What are you doing?"

Startled, Olivia dropped the ice cream, and Isabella’s stern gaze bore into her. "Do you dislike my touch so much that you'd harm your own body?"

Olivia bit her lip, wringing her hands. "I was just craving something sweet."

Isabella turned and left, a loud door slam echoing from upstairs.

Olivia cleaned up the mess and slowly went up, finding Isabella’s room empty. A wave of sadness washed over her. She didn't know why she felt so conflicted; she didn't want to resist but still felt nervous and scared.

Lying face down on her pillow, Olivia murmured, "Isabella, it's not that I don't want to. I just... I don't know how to tell you."

The next day, Olivia woke up late, sporting huge dark circles under her eyes. Lucas Wright, the butler, greeted her at the door. "Good morning, Olivia. Would you like a continental or American breakfast?"

Olivia glanced at Isabella’s closed door. "Lucas, where's Isabella?"

"He left early for a business trip."

A business trip? More like he was upset and left.

"Did he say how long he'd be gone?" Olivia asked, her voice tinged with worry.

"He didn't specify. But he did mention that while he's away, you are in charge of the castle."

"Me?" Olivia pointed to herself, surprised. "No way, I can barely manage myself! Lucas, you're the butler; you should handle things. I'm going shopping!"

Lucas chuckled. "I'll have the car prepared. But first, breakfast."

After eating, Olivia changed and instinctively picked up her phone, thinking about calling Isabella to check on him. But her finger hovered over his contact, and she hesitated. Maybe he was busy, or maybe... he was seeking comfort elsewhere.

The thought made her heart ache, like being pricked by tiny needles.

"Whatever, if it’s meant to be, it will be. If not, let it go," Olivia told herself, grabbing her bag and phone before heading out.
