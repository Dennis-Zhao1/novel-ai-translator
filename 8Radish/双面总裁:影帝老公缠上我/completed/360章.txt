“桐桐病危” (Critical Condition) is a heart-wrenching story about Olivia Stewart, a mother facing the unimaginable as her son, Tommy, is in critical condition following a kidnapping. The novel explores themes of family, resilience, and sacrifice, all wrapped in a dramatic narrative that keeps readers on the edge of their seats.

Olivia is barely holding herself together, supported by Lucas Wright, her family friend and confidant. With Tommy missing and the situation dire, Lucas tries to reassure Olivia, reminding her that she is the pillar for her children, including her twins, even as they face this crisis. Lucas promises that they will find Tommy, no matter what.

Meanwhile, Olivia’s son, Cody, returns from accompanying their father in the search for Tommy. Understandably, Olivia is concerned about Cody’s emotional state, but Lucas reassures her that Cody is fine; he just hasn’t been told the full extent of the situation to protect him from panic.

Throughout the excruciating wait, Olivia battles her fears, worried about both Tommy’s safety and Isabella Peterson, who is out there actively searching for her son. This isn't a typical kidnapping, and the stakes are terrifyingly high. When Olivia feels a tiny, warm hand on her icy one, she looks up to see Cody, his little face serious and determined. He assures her that their dad and brother will be fine, showing a maturity beyond his years.

Eventually, Lucas brings grave news—Tommy has been found, but he’s in bad shape with a severed carotid artery and severe blood loss, leaving him in a deep coma. The weight of this news nearly crushes Olivia, a former medical student who fully understands the gravity of her son's condition.

Olivia rushes to the emergency room, desperate to see Tommy, while Cody insists on coming along, prepared to donate blood if needed. The hospital’s blood supply is running low, and Olivia and her family are ready to do whatever it takes to save Tommy.

In the midst of chaos, Isabella arrives, providing a steadying presence for Olivia. She promises that Tommy will pull through and vows to tell him the truth about their relationship once he wakes up. Isabella’s words offer comfort, but Olivia’s mind races with the need for action.

The tension escalates when the family’s blood types don't match Tommy’s, a revelation that raises questions and fears about his true parentage. Despite this setback, Isabella assures Olivia that they will find a solution, even if it means confronting painful truths.

Isabella reveals that Alexander Peterson, Tommy’s biological father, is behind the kidnapping. This shocking twist leaves Olivia speechless, grappling with betrayal and anger. As Isabella vows to bring Alexander to justice, Olivia is left to confront the harsh reality that the man she once trusted could do such harm to their son.

In this gripping tale, the resilience of a mother and the strength of family love shine through the darkest of times. Olivia’s journey is one of courage and determination, as she fights to bring her son back from the brink and rebuild their shattered lives.
