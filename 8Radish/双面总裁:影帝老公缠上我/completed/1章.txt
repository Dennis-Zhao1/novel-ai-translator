Chapter 1: The Wrong Wedding, the Right Disaster
The grand ballroom of the Golden City Hotel was the epitome of luxury. Underneath a massive chandelier that sparkled like a thousand tiny suns, the polished marble floors gleamed with reflections of golden lights. Every detail of the room screamed perfection: cascading floral arrangements in shades of white and blush, gold-rimmed champagne glasses, and an orchestra playing a flawless rendition of the "Wedding March." Rose petals drifted gracefully from the domed ceiling, carried by an unseen breeze, as though the entire event was touched by magic.

Guests, dressed in their finest evening gowns and tailored suits, stood in reverent silence, their faces alight with anticipation. At the center of it all, the bride and groom walked hand in hand down the red carpet. Her ivory dress shimmered with every step, while his crisp black tuxedo and perfectly combed hair made him look like he’d stepped out of a magazine. Together, they were a picture of romance, a modern-day fairy tale.

Then the doors slammed open.

"Stop the wedding!"

The shout rang out, cutting through the delicate strains of the orchestra and echoing off the vaulted ceilings. The music stopped with a discordant screech, and all eyes whipped toward the entrance.

Standing there, bathed in the warm glow of the ballroom's lights, was a woman no one could ignore. Olivia Stewart.

She was tall, striking, and utterly unapologetic. Her makeup was bold—too bold for an event this elegant—and her crimson dress clung to her figure, accentuating a prominent baby bump. She had one hand perched on her hip, the other cradling her belly, as though daring anyone to challenge her. Her lips curled into a triumphant smile as she took in the sea of shocked faces. This was the moment she had planned for.

The plan was simple: cause a scene, humiliate Daniel Johnson, and expose his betrayal. She had rehearsed her lines, envisioned the gasps, the stares, and the fallout. But as her eyes scanned the room, a sinking feeling began to creep into her chest.

The bride wasn’t Emily Young.

Emily was average-looking, with a sweet, unassuming smile. This bride, however, was breathtaking—practically glowing. Her flawless features and confident posture were miles apart from Emily’s shy demeanor. Even with makeup and a designer gown, Emily could never look like this.

And the groom—oh, the groom.

Olivia’s breath hitched. He wasn’t Daniel Johnson.

This man was tall, broad-shouldered, and devastatingly handsome. His jet-black hair was neatly styled, and his sharp jawline gave him an almost regal air. His presence was magnetic, commanding the room without a word. As their eyes met, Olivia felt her heart stumble in its rhythm. There was no mistaking it. She had crashed the wrong wedding.

Panic began to bubble in her chest. How did this happen? She replayed the instructions in her mind—the address, the time, the name of the venue. Had she really gotten it wrong? She glanced up, and her stomach dropped.

Holographic fireworks exploded across the ceiling, forming glittering letters: “Engagement Ceremony of Isabella Peterson and Mia White.”

The wrong venue. The wrong couple. The wrong everything.

Her first instinct was to run, but her feet felt rooted to the spot. Hundreds of eyes bore into her, their whispers growing louder with each passing second. Before she could retreat, the groom stepped forward, his polished shoes clicking softly against the marble floor. His eyes—cold and calculating—locked onto hers.

"Are you carrying my child?"

The question dropped like a bomb. Gasps rippled through the crowd, and Olivia’s knees nearly buckled.

What?

She opened her mouth to deny it, to explain the mix-up, but the words tangled in her throat. The groom’s voice was calm, almost lazy, but there was a dangerous edge to it that made her skin prickle.

"I asked," he repeated, his gaze unwavering, "if that child is mine."

Olivia’s instincts screamed at her to flee, but there was nowhere to go. The doors behind her were already blocked by security guards in sharp black suits, their expressions unreadable. The crowd’s eyes darted between her and the groom, their curiosity electric.

Somewhere in the back, someone whispered, "Scandalous."

Olivia swallowed hard. Her plan was in shambles, but she couldn’t let herself crumble. If she admitted her mistake now, the humiliation would be unbearable. So, against every rational thought in her head, she nodded.

“Yes,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The collective gasp was deafening.

Mia White, the bride, let out a strangled cry of outrage. "You lying—" She cut herself off, her manicured hands curling into fists. "How dare you come in here and ruin my engagement!"

Her voice rose to a shriek, and she surged forward as though ready to claw at Olivia’s face. Olivia instinctively stepped back, her hands flying to her belly in a protective gesture. "Don’t touch me! I’m pregnant!"

Chaos erupted. Guests began murmuring loudly, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of disbelief and excitement. Camera flashes sparked from all directions as reporters who had been invited to cover the glamorous event turned their lenses on Olivia.

"Enough!"

The command came from a woman descending the grand staircase. Her presence silenced the room. She was tall, with an air of authority that made everyone—even the enraged bride—pause. Her diamond earrings sparkled as she surveyed the scene with icy composure.

"My son will not abandon his responsibility," she declared, her gaze landing on the groom.

Mia’s face turned an alarming shade of red. "Mrs. Peterson, you can’t possibly believe this woman!"

Mrs. Peterson ignored her, focusing instead on Olivia. "What’s your name, dear?"

"Olivia," she stammered.

"Olivia," Mrs. Peterson repeated, her tone softening slightly. "If you’re carrying my grandchild, you’ll be treated with the respect you deserve. Security, let her through."

Mia exploded. "You can’t do this! She’s lying!"

But Mrs. Peterson raised a hand, silencing her. "We’ll handle this privately." She turned to Olivia with a small, approving nod. "Come with us."

Olivia’s stomach churned. This wasn’t what she’d wanted. She’d expected a quick, dramatic scene—yelling, maybe some tears, and then a hasty exit. Instead, she was being whisked into a vortex of misunderstandings and power plays. As the groom—Isabella Peterson—extended a hand to guide her forward, his lips quirked into the faintest of smirks.

"Welcome to the family," he murmured.

Olivia’s mind reeled. What had she gotten herself into?
