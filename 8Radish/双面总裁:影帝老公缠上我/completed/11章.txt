Ethan King watched as Isabella Peterson walked away with Olivia Stewart still in his arms, feeling a strange mix of relief and panic. He couldn’t help but feel like throwing a small celebration now that Isabella was leaving, but his joy was short-lived. Olivia was still trapped in Isabella’s grasp!

"Hey! Put Olivia down!" Ethan yelled, sprinting toward them, though he knew he was no match for Isabella.

Isabella turned, giving him a look that was half-amused, half-dismissive, as if Ethan were a clown performing a silly routine. Ethan felt his bravado shrink. "Uh... I mean, why don't you take her back to her room to rest?"

He mentally kicked himself for losing his nerve. Isabella was his kryptonite, and he knew it. With a smirk, Isabella declared, "From now on, she's mine."

"What? No, you can't do that! Give her back!" Ethan protested, reaching out to grab Olivia, even though he knew he wouldn’t get far.

True to form, Isabella deftly sidestepped, swiftly kicking Ethan away with a move he didn’t even see coming. Ethan slammed into the wall with a thud, clutching his stomach in pain. Thankfully, he managed to dodge just enough to avoid serious injury. He struggled to his feet, wincing, and called out weakly, "Olivia..."

"If you wake her, I'll make sure you never speak again," Isabella threatened, his voice chillingly calm and devoid of emotion.

Ethan knew he couldn’t just stand by and let Isabella have his way with her. Olivia, blissfully unaware, was a heavy sleeper, especially when drunk—she wouldn't wake easily unless there was an earthquake. But Ethan had to try something. He gathered his strength, stood up straighter, and yelled with all his might, "Olivia Stewart!"

Olivia stirred, mumbling sleepily, "Ugh, so noisy... can't a girl get some sleep?"

Isabella quickly turned away, gently patting her back and soothing her, "It's nothing, go back to sleep."

Olivia, still half-asleep, reached out, clutching Isabella's shirt, and nestled comfortably against him. Isabella's stern expression softened into a fond smile as he gently rocked her back to sleep. "There, there, no one will bother you now."

Ethan watched, dumbfounded. Who was this Isabella that Olivia had gotten mixed up with? He seemed like a split personality! Had they known each other before, and Olivia just never mentioned it? Or had Isabella fallen for her at first sight?

While Ethan pondered, he felt a chill run down his spine as Isabella shot him a cold, icy glare. Remembering Isabella’s earlier threat, Ethan covered his mouth with his hand, sweat dripping from his forehead.

"You wouldn't dare cut my tongue out! Olivia would hate you for it!" Ethan blurted out in desperation.

Isabella glanced down at Olivia, his eyes softening again as he pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead before carrying her out the door. Ethan, determined not to give up, clutched his aching stomach and followed as quickly as he could, but he missed the elevator. By the time he caught the next one down, Isabella’s cars were just pulling away. Ethan jumped into his own car and raced after them.

Meanwhile, in a nearby garden, a man named Daniel Johnson lay in a bush, looking worse for wear. His clothes were torn, his face bruised, and a broken camera lay beside him—a clear sign of a paparazzo having a very bad day. Today was supposed to be Daniel’s big day, his wedding day, and yet here he was, in the bushes.

His phone buzzed somewhere in the grass. Daniel groaned, crawling to find it, relieved to see it wasn’t broken. "Hello?" he answered weakly.

"Daniel Johnson! Where are you?" Emily Young’s voice blared through the phone, making him wince.

"I told you, I'm out getting a story."

"You're always chasing stories, Daniel! Following those B-list actors around and getting nothing but pictures of them picking their noses. It’s your wedding night, and you're not even here! If you don't come back in half an hour, don’t bother coming back at all!"

"Calm down, honey. I’ve got a big scoop tonight!" Daniel replied, smiling despite the pain from a cut on his lip.

"Live with your big scoop, then! If you don’t make me happy, forget about getting that posh city address!" Emily snapped before hanging up.

"Damn," Daniel muttered at the disconnected call, tossing his phone aside. He slowly pulled out a tiny memory card from his pocket, grinning through the pain.

Tomorrow, everyone would see his headline story, and money would come pouring in. Today, he’d been tailing a washed-up actress rumored to be the other woman in some scandalous affair, but instead, he stumbled upon a whole fleet of luxury cars. He recognized the silhouette of a major celebrity known for never having any rumored romances. And there she was, in his arms!

Daniel had snapped away with his camera, but the flash gave him away, leading to a swift and brutal beatdown from the celebrity’s security. But Daniel was a pro and had pocketed the memory card before the camera was destroyed.

He dreamt of fame, fortune, and maybe even Olivia coming back to him, as he limped away into the night.

Back on the highway, Ethan was in a desperate chase, tailing Isabella’s convoy. His car was no match for theirs, but he was determined not to lose them. He floored the accelerator, pushing his car to its limits.

As minutes turned into an hour, the chase continued. It felt like the bodyguard’s car was toying with him, keeping just out of reach. But Ethan refused to back down. "I won’t let them hurt you, Olivia," he vowed, gritting his teeth.

Then, his dashboard flashed a fuel warning. "Not now!" Ethan cursed, deciding to risk it all. He pushed his car to get closer, daring the bodyguard vehicle. Just as he maneuvered to force it to stop, his car sputtered to a halt, out of gas.

The bodyguard car did stop—but not because of him. Ethan got out, panting, and tapped on their window. "Hey!" he called.

The window rolled down, and a young guy inside gave him a thumbs-up. "Man, you’re crazy!"

Ethan, exhausted, leaned against the car. "Get out," he ordered, trying to sound tough.

"Sure thing!" The guy opened the door, knocking Ethan off his feet, then quickly closed it again. He pulled out a small gun and shot spikes into Ethan’s tires, deflating them instantly.

Ethan, back on his feet, gaped in disbelief. "You can’t do that!"

The guy just laughed, driving circles around Ethan before speeding off. "See ya!"

Ethan threw a shoe at the car in frustration, but missed. The guy leaned out once more, taunting, "Try to take my boss’s girl, and he’ll find a million ways to make you regret it!"

Ethan stood there, shoeless and defeated, as the car sped away, leaving him on the roadside.
