“Come on, Olivia, I’m not asking for much,” Ethan said, his voice a mix of frustration and affection. He slumped down heavily on the edge of Olivia Stewart's bed, the wooden frame creaking under his weight. "I’m seriously beat. My feet feel like they’re not attached to my body anymore."

Olivia chuckled softly at his dramatic complaint, her smile warm and reassuring. "No worries, Ethan. Compared to when I first got here, things are way better now." She gestured around the sparse room. "Sorry there's no chair. You look exhausted, so just make do with the bed for now."

Hearing her say he looked like a "tired dog" amused Ethan more than anything. At least it meant she hadn’t completely shut him out yet. "I know, right? This place is a bit of a dump. What happened to the card I gave you?"

Ethan's voice rose slightly, concern etched across his face as he glanced accusingly at Olivia. He had no idea she had mailed the card back the very next day.

Olivia offered an awkward smile, avoiding further explanation. "Ethan, you know me. I can’t just rely on someone else’s money anymore. But don’t worry, I’ll keep it for emergencies. Consider it a favor to me, okay?"

Olivia burst out laughing, the absurdity of the situation breaking through her defenses. "Ethan, you’re the first person I’ve met who begs someone to take their money!"

Ethan's face fell, frustration clear in his eyes. "Olivia, do we really have to maintain this distance? Forget whatever nonsense I said that day. I was just caught up in the moment. I’m still that crazy friend who’s here for fun and mischief."

Olivia shook her head, a gentle smile on her lips. "You only had coffee that day, remember?"

"Just don’t push me away to some distant corner, okay?" Ethan’s voice was a mix of pleading and determination.

Olivia turned away, blinking back tears. Despite everything with Isabella Peterson, she couldn’t blame Ethan. She just couldn’t reciprocate his feelings, and that meant keeping him at arm’s length until he moved on.

"Ethan, I’ve thought about just being there in the background, watching you be happy. What I said before was a mistake, and I regret it. I know you won’t come back if I’m around, so I’m leaving for a while."

Olivia looked genuinely surprised. "Where are you going?"

"I don’t know yet. Maybe wander around for a bit. Or maybe head back to the family, marry someone I don’t love, and just live out my life."

"Don’t do that, Ethan," Olivia said urgently, grabbing his hand without thinking.

Ethan glanced down at her hand on his, savoring the warmth and wishing he could hold onto it forever. But he resisted the urge, instead placing a set of keys in her palm. "I’m going away for a while. Look after the apartment for me, will you? I’ll cover any expenses. And if you need help around the place, Emma’s there. She’s better at cooking and cleaning than you are."

He closed her fingers around the keys, his expression serious. "Please, Olivia. We’ve been friends for so long. Just do this one thing for me."

Olivia felt a lump in her throat, clutching the keys tightly even as they bit into her palm. Ethan had always been so thoughtful. Even when things got tough, he made sure she was taken care of. His kindness weighed heavily on her heart because she knew she couldn’t repay him in the way he wanted.

"Ethan..." Her voice cracked, unable to continue.

"Don’t say anything," Ethan interrupted gently, patting her hand. "Just promise you’ll help me out this once. That’s all I need."

Tears welled up in Olivia’s eyes, spilling over despite her efforts to hold them back.

Ethan hesitated, wanting to wipe away her tears, but stopped himself. "It’s late. You should get some rest. I’m heading out."

With that, Ethan stood up and quickly left the room, as if afraid any delay might change her mind. Olivia opened her mouth to call him back but stopped herself. Maybe, when they saw each other next, they could be friends again without the weight of unresolved feelings between them.

She looked at the keys in her hand, tears falling freely as the reality of his departure sank in.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Isabella Peterson lay in bed, exhausted from pain and medication, finally asleep. Without the usual sternness on his face, he looked peaceful, his long eyelashes casting shadows on his cheeks.

Lucas Wright, standing vigil by the bed, kept a watchful eye on the IV drip. Outside, a shadow flitted past the window—one of the guards assigned to watch over Olivia. It wasn’t about spying, but ensuring she was safe in case of trouble.

Lucas checked the IV levels one last time before slipping quietly out of the room. Just as he closed the door, Isabella’s eyes snapped open. Years of training had honed his senses, making him a light sleeper. The only time he truly relaxed was when Olivia was by his side.

Outside, Lucas caught a hushed conversation through the ajar door. "Is something up with Olivia?"

"She’s fine, but that guy, Ethan, went into her room and hasn’t come out for half an hour. We weren’t sure if we should intervene, so..."

Lucas sighed internally, frustrated by the guard’s lack of initiative. Couldn’t they think of a better excuse to check in, like delivering room service? Instead, they ran back to report, wasting precious time.

A loud crash from inside the room interrupted Lucas’s thoughts. "Get back there and keep an eye on things!"

Lucas rushed back inside to find Isabella had knocked over the IV stand, struggling to sit up, his eyes blazing with determination. "I’m going out," he declared, voice icy and commanding.

"Of course, sir. Let me help you," Lucas offered, moving to support him.

Isabella shrugged him off, pride stung. Even weakened, he refused to rely on anyone. As he staggered towards the door, Lucas moved behind him, delivering a swift chop to the neck. Isabella crumpled, unconscious before he could protest.

"Sorry, sir," Lucas murmured, catching his fall. "Punish me later if you must, but Olivia wouldn’t do anything like that. Nothing’s going to happen between her and Ethan."

Lucas eased Isabella back onto the bed, calling for a nurse to resume the IV, adding a mild sedative to ensure he slept through the night.

Isabella awoke the next morning, leaping out of bed the moment his eyes opened, hands already reaching for Lucas’s throat.

Lucas stood still, resolute in his actions. In his mind, knocking out Isabella was the only way to keep him from making a rash decision.

Isabella’s grip loosened as he noticed the dark circles under Lucas’s eyes, evidence of sleepless nights spent by his side. He released Lucas, turning away. "Get out."

"Thank you for sparing me," Lucas said quietly, keeping his eyes downcast.

"I’m not your master anymore. Leave."

Suddenly, Lucas dropped to his knees, pleading, "Punish me however you wish, but don’t banish me from the family. I can’t bear it."

The thought of leaving the only home he’d ever known was unbearable.

Isabella sighed, glancing at him. "Get up. Stop groveling. You’re too old for this nonsense."

If Olivia heard about this, she’d probably scold him for not respecting his elders.

Lucas remained stubbornly on his knees.

"Go," Isabella ordered, softer this time. "I don’t want to see you for at least an hour."

Lucas understood. It meant he was forgiven, at least for now.
