Title: "The Role I Never Wanted"

---

Olivia Stewart signed her name with a flourish before looking up at Director Wang. "Now, can you finally get my sister a role?" she asked, trying to keep her tone light despite the tension racing through her veins.

Director Wang chuckled as he reviewed the contract, his face breaking into a grin. "Olivia, I've never been one to go back on my word."

"Great, but could you maybe give her a bigger part? Like, maybe the second female lead?"

Director Wang hesitated, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "Well, I can place her in a role that's closely tied to the main character. It won't have many lines, but she'll be on screen a lot."

Olivia weighed the offer in her mind. It wasn't perfect, but who was she to haggle with a director, right? "Thank you, Director Wang!" she said, feeling a rush of relief.

"You're welcome! Here's your copy of the contract. Take it easy today; someone will be in touch with your schedule soon," Director Wang assured her.

"Thank you, Director Wang and Assistant Director. See you both later!" Olivia waved as she left the VIP room, clutching the contract as if it were a lead weight.

Her sister, Sophie Cook, had set her heart on the lead role. Olivia had only come along to support her, yet somehow, she ended up being cast as the lead. How was she going to explain this to Sophie?

Would Sophie even believe her?

With heavy steps, Olivia descended the stairs, each one feeling like a hurdle. She had to face Sophie, no matter how hard it was.

"Olivia!"

The moment Olivia appeared at the staircase, Sophie dashed over as if her life depended on it.

"I heard you're the lead in the new show! Tell me it's not true! They made a mistake, right? Tell me!" Sophie demanded, her voice trembling with urgency.

"Sophie..." Olivia began, her throat dry and scratchy.

Sophie snatched the contract from Olivia's hands, flipping through it frantically. When her eyes landed on Olivia's signature, her face turned ghostly pale, and she stumbled back, muttering, "No, no..."

Olivia grabbed her sister, steadying her. "Sophie, calm down!"

"Calm down? You just came to support me, and now you're the lead! How am I supposed to calm down?" Sophie's eyes glazed over, her voice dropping. "You don't know what I sacrificed for this audition."

Olivia bit her lip, staying silent. She knew that anything she said now would be meaningless.

Suddenly, Sophie shoved the contract back at Olivia, her grip on her sister's arm like a vice. "You'll give it to me, right? You're my sister. You have to give it to me!"

Olivia sighed, trapped in a corner. "Sophie, it's not that I don't want to. They won't allow it."

"Liar! If you want to, they'll change it! Go tell them to change the name now!"

Sophie's voice rose to a shrill pitch, piercing the air like nails on a chalkboard. Her carefully made-up face twisted with anger into something almost unrecognizable.

"I told them before I signed, but they said if I stepped down, you'd lose your chance too. But if I took the role, they promised you another part," Olivia explained, trying to remain calm.

"Right, as if! Olivia, don't make up stories. You're not a superstar. Why would they choose you over everyone else?" Sophie shot back, her words a rapid-fire assault.

Olivia couldn't argue; the situation was baffling even to her.

"Oh, I get it now!" Sophie smirked, looking Olivia up and down. "You planned this all along, didn't you? Pretending to be supportive while stealing the spotlight!"

Olivia's patience snapped. "I'm not as low as you think!"

"Bull! I knew I couldn't rely on you. You said you'd ask your connections to help me, but you just took everything for yourself! What did you do to get this role?" Sophie sneered, her face contorted with rage.

"Sophie!" Olivia shouted, her voice firm. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. "I'm your sister! I've never done anything like that!"

"Sister? Ha! Why so angry, Olivia? Guilty conscience?" Sophie taunted.

Olivia took a deep breath. "Believe it or not, I’m telling the truth."

"The truth is you stole my role! You promised Mom you'd look after me, and now this? You liar!" Sophie screamed, her words cutting deep.

In her anger, Sophie swung at Olivia, aiming to slap her—

The slap echoed in the silence.

Time froze.

Sophie held her cheek, staring at Olivia in disbelief. "You hit me? You actually hit me?"

Olivia let go of Sophie's wrist, her voice icy. "That was for Mom and Dad."

"You dare mention them? They never laid a finger on me, and you think you can?" Sophie raged. "You swore to Mom you'd take care of me!"

"So I should just stand here and take your abuse?" Olivia's voice was firm, her eyes filled with hurt.

"Sophie, I owe you nothing!" Olivia declared, turning away. "If I failed anyone, it's our parents, for letting you become this way."

With that, Olivia walked away, tears streaming down her face. Her heart shattered over the sister she'd tried so hard to raise, now lost to jealousy and bitterness.

"Olivia! Think you're so great with your connections? I'll surpass you one day!" Sophie shouted after her, Olivia's retreating figure the only response.

The word "connections" echoed in Olivia's mind, a sharp reminder of the assumptions people made about her and Isabella Peterson. To hear it from her sister was like a knife twisting in her heart.

Olivia had always tried to stand on her own, refusing Isabella's help to maintain her self-respect. But now, her sister had publicly accused her of riding on someone else's coattails.

Every sacrifice, every concession Olivia had made for Sophie felt like feeding a thankless beast. She wiped her tears, telling herself it was over. She'd done her best.

At the curb, a sleek black car awaited. Michael Wright opened the door, bowing slightly. "Olivia, the boss is busy, but he sent me to get you. Please, get in."

Olivia paused, then climbed into the car silently, clutching the crumpled contract in her hand.

From the rearview mirror, Michael noticed Olivia's red eyes and tear-streaked face. He said nothing, driving off quietly.

In the distance, Sophie watched the car leave, seething with envy. What did Olivia have that she didn't? How had she ended up with all the luck?

Sophie vowed to bring her sister down from her pedestal, to claim what should have been hers—the lead role, the glamorous connections—everything.

Determined, she stormed back to the set, intent on finding a way to reclaim her dreams.

As the staff packed up, Sophie approached frantically. "Where's Director Adams?"

A technician blinked at her, confused. "Director who?"

"The assistant director!" Sophie snapped impatiently.

The technician pointed vaguely. "Our assistant director is over there."

"I know that!" Sophie huffed. "I'm talking about the one named Jones!"

The technician shook his head. "Sorry, there's no one named Jones in our crew."

"You've got to be kidding me!"
