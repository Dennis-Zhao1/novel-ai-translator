Olivia Stewart had this gorgeous, long hair that was shiny and smooth like a raven's feathers. Isabella Peterson loved it so much that she eagerly volunteered for the job of blow-drying it.

As Olivia sat in front of the vanity, Isabella expertly ran her fingers through the strands, her long fingers moving rhythmically back and forth.

Suddenly, Isabella paused and asked, "Does your crush also like playing with your hair?"

"How did you know?" Olivia blurted out, immediately covering her mouth with her hand, her big eyes wide with surprise.

Oh no!

She was in trouble now!

"Isabella, don't misunderstand! It's not like I enjoy him messing with my hair—he's the one who does it! No, wait, that's not it. He's just so bored that he plays with my hair! No, no, I mean, I didn't even realize he was doing it."

Olivia was getting more tangled up in her words the more she tried to explain.

Isabella's lips twitched slightly in amusement. "Are you nervous?"

"No, I'm not nervous! I didn't do anything wrong, so why should I be nervous?"

"Then tell me, how does he play with your hair?" Isabella teased, twirling a half-dry lock around her finger. "Like this? Or like this?"

"Honestly, it's not a big deal. He just likes to wrap it around his fingers, like you sometimes do."

Olivia slapped her hand over her face again. Idiot! Why did she let that slip?

Isabella might just explode like a firecracker over such an intimate gesture!

"Isabella, it wasn't my fault! I didn't even notice at the time, and he pulled my scalp a bit. That jerk doesn't know how to be gentle at all!"

Oops, that wasn't right! 

"No, no, I mean, he's not as gentle as you are. Ugh, that's not it either..."

Olivia's thoughts were a mess, and she was running out of words. She peeked through her fingers to gauge Isabella's reaction.

Isabella's handsome face showed no expression. He was focused on playing with the strands of hair, his attention so serious that it was hard to read him.

Olivia grew more anxious by the second, her heart pounding until she finally couldn't take it anymore and yelled, "It wasn’t my fault, Isabella! Forgive me!"

"Then tell me, what was your fault? Holding hands? Getting hugged around the waist? Almost getting kissed?"

Olivia stared at Isabella in shock. Suddenly, a light bulb went off in her head, and her fear turned to joy.

"Isabella, you watched the livestream, didn't you?"

"…"

"Didn't you?"

Olivia leaned closer to Isabella, her big eyes sparkling as she asked the question again, her face almost brushing his.

Isabella raised an eyebrow slightly. Was this little troublemaker learning to change the subject?

Olivia suddenly jumped up and hugged Isabella's arm affectionately, looking at him with expectation and a hint of shyness. "Do I look pretty today?"

Ah, so that's what she cared about.

In Isabella's dark eyes, a playful smile started to spread like ripples on water.

But he didn't show it immediately. Instead, he kept a straight face and shook his head.

The light in Olivia's eyes dimmed quickly. She looked down, biting her lip with a hint of self-mockery, unable to hide her disappointment.

Of course, next to those glamorous celebrities, she was nothing.

Then suddenly, a deep voice sounded above her. "Not pretty, but stunning."

Uh… what?

Olivia's half-bent lips froze, then quickly bounced back, turning upwards in a wide grin.

"Isabella, what did you say? Say it again!"

Olivia looked up, her eyes shining like stars, full of hope and delight.

Isabella couldn't help but smile, cupping Olivia's face in his hands. He gazed into her eyes, and with a serious tone, repeated, "Sweetheart, you're stunning!"

"Hehehe…"

Olivia's smile spread wide, her cheeks flushed pink, her eyes sparkling like fireworks.

"So, when you looked at me, did your heart skip a beat?"

More than a beat, it was like…

"I just wanted to sweep you off your feet!"

Olivia immediately felt a black line streak across her face, any romantic notions chased away by Isabella's bluntness.

"Who do you think was the most beautiful today?"

"Of course, it was you!"

Hehe!

"My girl could never be anything but beautiful!"

Wait, who was the compliment for?

"So, since I made you proud, how are you going to reward me?"

"With a little whip."

What?

A whip?

Oh my gosh!

Was he still jealous and thinking of punishing me? No, that's domestic violence!

Olivia quickly wriggled out of Isabella's embrace and ran.

Isabella stretched out his long arm and effortlessly pulled her back.

"Isabella, no, please…"

"I only heard the last word!"

"Isabella, let… hey, where are your hands going? Get them off! Mmm… Isabella, please, please spare me…"

The breeze fluttered the curtains, leaving the room cloaked in romance.

Lucas Wright, who had come upstairs to announce that lunch was ready, saw the closed door of Isabella and Olivia's room and shook his head in resignation. These two troublemakers, would they starve themselves?

Well, he wasn't too worried about the young master's stamina, but Olivia… could she handle this three times a day?

Olivia eventually fell asleep from exhaustion and woke up to find it was already late afternoon. She felt weak all over and was starving.

"Awake?"

Olivia blinked her eyes open to find Isabella's handsome face right in front of hers.

Isabella was propped up on one elbow, lying on his side, watching her sleep. Who knew how long he'd been there?

Olivia's cheeks flushed pink, and she turned away.

She tried to roll over to give Isabella the cold shoulder, but it didn't work. Just moving a little made her feel like she'd been run over, sore and weak.

Olivia scowled, grinding her back teeth in frustration.

This jerk!

"Comfortable!" came a teasing voice from beside her.

Olivia glared at Isabella with fire in her eyes.

Isabella raised an eyebrow mischievously. "Not happy? Feel free to get your revenge!"

Revenge, my foot!

In the end, I'm the one who loses out!

Olivia shot him a look that clearly said, "Do you think I'm stupid?"

Isabella's lips curved into a mesmerizing smile. He stretched out his long arms and scooped Olivia up.

Olivia was startled. "Again?"

Isabella chuckled, amused. "Want more?"

"No, no, I don't want more!"

Olivia shook her head vigorously, her fluffy head burrowing into Isabella's chest as she grumbled discontentedly, "I don't know who wants more!"

"I do!"

Isabella shamelessly admitted.

Olivia felt even more embarrassed.

This guy really didn't know what it meant to be subtle!

Isabella set Olivia down, propping her up with a soft pillow behind her.

Seeing that he wasn't going to pounce, Olivia sighed in relief.

Isabella picked up a tray from the bedside table, and Olivia's eyes lit up.

"Oh my gosh, Isabella, you're the best! I thought you were going to…"

"Thought I was going to what?"

"Uh… let's eat! Eating is the most important thing in the world!"

Isabella removed the lid from the tray, and the delicious aroma of food filled the air. Olivia's stomach growled loudly in response.

Oh my gosh, so embarrassing!

"Start with some soup."

Isabella scooped up a spoonful, and before he could blow on it to cool it, Olivia had already gobbled it up, burning her tongue in the process.

Watching her eat like she was starving, Isabella felt a pang of regret but still scolded her gently, "What's the rush? Are you a reincarnated hungry ghost?"

"You…"

Olivia glared at him defiantly. "Isabella, you must have been a scorpion in your past life, that's why you're so sharp-tongued now!"

Isabella's eyes darkened, his voice teasing, "I'm a scorpion, alright, just for you!"

Olivia was left speechless.

"Drink!"

Isabella's commanding voice brought her back, and she looked down to see another spoonful of soup waiting.

Learning from her previous mistake, Olivia sipped it cautiously. This time, the temperature was just right.

In the time they were bickering, Isabella had cooled it down for her.

A wave of warmth filled Olivia's heart.

After a few sips of the nourishing soup, Isabella began to feed her rice and dishes, each spoonful perfectly balanced with half rice and half vegetables.

Olivia had a small appetite, and after seeing those slim-waisted celebrities on the red carpet today, she was feeling a bit self-conscious. She stopped eating after half a bowl.

Isabella's expression turned serious. "I personally fed you, and you're not going to finish?"

"I really can't eat anymore. Isabella, you're probably hungry too, why don't you eat?"

"Olivia! Are you asking me to eat your leftovers?"

"Oh no, I mean, I've eaten enough, but you're still hungry. You should go eat!"

Isabella's gaze was intense as he stared at a particular spot. "I've already eaten, but if you feel bad for me, I don't mind having more!"

Olivia followed his gaze and quickly clutched her neckline. "You pervert! No peeking!"

Isabella snorted, "It's not like I haven't seen it before!"

Olivia was about to lose it, shouting, "Isabella, get out!"

Isabella's expression turned sour, "Little one, do you know whose turf this is?"

Olivia was speechless, her expression awkward.

Isabella realized he'd been too harsh, but as the proud young master, he had no intention of apologizing. So, instead...
