Chapter One: Muddy Mishaps

Ethan King was in no mood for nonsense. His icy demeanor melted just a bit as he pondered the situation, his hands resting on his knees, and his sharp blue eyes flashing with thought.

"Do you think she might've just left the set and gone home on her own?" he asked, his voice low and intense.

"Huh? Uh... maybe?" Amy Green blinked, caught off guard that the boss was actually asking for his opinion. Feeling unexpectedly important, he quickly responded, "It's possible. But Olivia Stewart's car is still parked there, and Peterson Group's security team didn't see her leave the set."

Could she have magically disappeared?

Ethan's piercing gaze swept over Amy's striking face, his voice cold as ice. "Are you sure you checked everywhere?"

"Everywhere except... the ladies' restroom," Amy replied, wary as he felt the chill emanating from Ethan's stare.

Feeling uneasy under Ethan's scrutiny, Amy hurriedly suggested, "I'll get a female staff member to check the restroom!"

With that, Amy made a swift exit.

A few minutes later, he returned, looking deflated, and shrugged. "She's not there."

Ethan's brows furrowed, his frustration evident. He stood up and headed out of the set, following a quiet little path he remembered from years ago.

The place was an exact replica of a quaint village from his past, and the film set was located where his old retreat had been. If he remembered correctly, there was a path leading out to the terraced fields beyond.

Back then, whenever Olivia was upset or overwhelmed, she'd slip away along this path to sit by the fields and lose herself in thought.

Amy, curious about Ethan's sudden departure, trailed behind him at a safe distance, not daring to get too close.

Ethan soon reached the terraced fields. It wasn't planting season, so the fields were bare, just stretches of yellow mud. He scanned the area and spotted a small figure sitting in the shade of a field ridge.

There you are, he thought, a flicker of hope lighting up his eyes like a shooting star.

Ethan's lips twitched, unable to hide his excitement. His hands clenched by his sides as he whispered to himself, "Olivia... have you really remembered our past?"

He approached quietly, moving carefully so as not to disturb the scene. There she was, Olivia Stewart, crouched in the mud, absorbed in her task, oblivious to his presence.

Ethan crouched beside her, watching silently, just like he used to. A smile crept onto his face as he observed her progress.

He chuckled inwardly. "You've grown, little one. You used to just sit and daydream; now you're playing in the mud!"

Despite his silent critique of her childish antics, Ethan couldn't tear his gaze away from Olivia.

She was diligently shaping the mud, her nimble fingers working as if crafting a masterpiece. Ethan's fingers itched to help her brush the stray hair from her face, which danced with her every movement.

Olivia soon formed a smooth lump of clay, and Ethan watched in fascination as she skillfully shaped it into a figure.

As she worked, she added details with a blade of grass, carving hair into the little clay head.

Ethan observed closely, startled by the resemblance. The curly hair, the posture—it seemed to be a mini version of him. Well, except for the face, which was hilariously exaggerated.

Olivia continued, adjusting the nose and eyebrows, turning it into a comical caricature. She added two little blue berries for eyes, which uncannily matched Ethan's own.

"Ha! Take that for bullying me!" Olivia muttered, satisfied with her creation, as she set the little monster aside and moved on to crafting its body.

Ethan's face shifted through a spectrum of emotions. Her revenge for his earlier teasing was unexpected and oddly amusing.

He recalled the background check on Olivia that revealed her weekend activities—volunteering, singing under the bridge, molding clay for extra cash. Since she'd been with him, these hobbies had disappeared from her life, taken over by his demands.

Ethan's gaze softened as he watched the joy on her face. The simple act of playing with mud brought her genuine happiness, a light that seemed to envelop her.

His fingers curled, a sudden urge to jump in and join her.

Olivia's hands moved with grace, breathing life into the clay. Soon, the figure was whole, a tiny replica of a sharply dressed Ethan.

Ethan couldn't help but admire the skill, despite the grotesque face. Olivia finished by adding a jaunty little grass hat, making the figure even more comically endearing.

Olivia lifted the figure, addressing it with mock sternness. "If you dare bully me again, I'll..."

Ethan's eyes widened as she threatened the clay figure with a blade of grass. A shiver ran down his spine at the thought.

After venting her frustration, Olivia felt a wave of satisfaction. She tossed the clay figure aside, stood up, and brushed the dirt off her hands.

Ethan, caught off guard by her sudden movement, toppled backward into the muddy field with a loud splat.

"What was that?" Olivia turned to see Ethan sprawled in the mud, his face speckled with dark patches, looking utterly bedraggled.

"Pfft!" She couldn't help it; she burst out laughing.

"Olivia Stewart!" Ethan roared, his face dark with a mix of mud and indignation.

Oh no, what have I done? Olivia thought, clapping a hand over her mouth. Then, without a second thought, she bolted.

Ethan struggled to rise from the mud, but it clung to him stubbornly.

"Damn it!" he cursed, exasperated.

Amy, who had been watching from a distance, rushed over to help Ethan to his feet.

Ethan quickly shed his muddy jacket, tossing it to the ground in disgust. But his pants? Well, those he'd have to keep on. No way was he going to parade around without them!

And so, the day ended with a mud-covered Ethan, an amused Olivia, and a lesson learned: never underestimate the power of mud... or a girl's imagination.
