Olivia Stewart had always had a knack for getting herself into sticky situations, but this one was particularly ridiculous. Isabella Peterson, a guy who was supposed to be too busy conquering the world, had somehow ended up as her personal babysitter, taking care of her every need like she was some kind of royalty. He even washed her face three times a day. It was a shame, really, because she was just faking her injury. She couldn't risk Isabella finding out, though. What if he scrubbed too hard one day and discovered her secret?

Olivia was desperate to get back to her acting classes at the academy, but every time she asked Isabella to let her go, he flat-out refused. "Are you kidding me, Olivia?" he'd say. "I'm ditching work to be with you, and you want to leave? You can't go anywhere until that face of yours is completely healed!"

The truth was, her face was fine—she'd been using a waterproof lip liner to fake the injury—but she couldn't keep up the charade forever. Isabella was supposed to be working on some big construction project in a little town, and she knew he'd have to leave soon. She tried to convince him, promising to be careful and return as soon as possible with a flawless face.

Isabella hesitated. He had a lot on his plate. The construction site needed his attention, and Olivia really did need to get back to her acting, especially with a new movie starting soon. But that mark on her face, even though it was faint, just wouldn't go away. It was like it was cursed.

Seeing Isabella's indecision, Olivia pressed her case. "Come on, Isabella, you can't keep torturing yourself. Aren't you afraid you'll go stir-crazy without any... you know, action?"

"Olivia Stewart!" Isabella growled, pulling her into his arms and giving her a teasing bite on the lip. "When you're better, I'm going to make up for all this lost time."

Olivia just laughed it off, hoping Isabella would never uncover her little secret. The next day, Isabella finally left for his construction project, and Olivia headed back to her classes. Unlike the last time, when she had only a single bodyguard, this time she had an entourage, courtesy of Isabella. It was like she was a rock star or something, complete with bottled water, face towels, and hand sanitizer—all the comforts of home.

As the impressive convoy pulled up to the academy, Olivia was greeted by Michael Wright, who opened the car door for her. But as she stepped out, she was surrounded by Lucas Wright and the rest of the security team. Olivia rolled her eyes. "Guys, seriously? How am I supposed to go to class like this? Just go home! I'm not a child; I can take care of myself."

Lucas looked conflicted. "But Isabella was very clear. We need to be with you at all times to ensure your safety."

"You know how picky Isabella is," Olivia said. "He makes a big deal out of every little thing. I don't know how he's surviving on that dusty construction site."

Lucas, knowing Isabella's true motives, just kept quiet. He couldn't spill the beans about Isabella's secret identity or the real reason behind the new movie project, so he just shrugged and remained silent.

Olivia sighed. "If you won't leave, then just wait here. I promise I'll take care of myself."

"But Olivia," Lucas pleaded, "we can't leave you alone!"

"You're making this difficult for me!" she snapped. "Isabella isn't here, and I should have a say in this. Just wait here. I'll be fine."

Lucas reluctantly agreed, but not before making her promise to be careful. Olivia finally managed to shake off the entourage and headed into the academy alone, relishing the freedom.

Inside, things had changed. Ever since the Sarah Moore incident, people treated Olivia with a mix of fear and respect. Students avoided her like she was a ticking time bomb, especially those who had once mocked her.

As she walked down the hall, she overheard a couple of students gossiping about her. "I heard Olivia Stewart is with some big-shot billionaire," one said. "That's why she got the lead role, even though her acting's not that great."

"Yeah, must be nice having a sugar daddy," the other replied.

Olivia stood in front of them, watching as they realized who she was. They panicked. One dropped to her knees, begging for forgiveness, while the other started slapping herself, blaming her loose tongue for the mess they were in.

Olivia crossed her arms and watched. It served them right for spreading rumors. The commotion caught the attention of others, who stopped to watch from a distance.

Once the girls had punished themselves enough, Olivia told them to get up. As they gathered themselves, a piece of paper fell from one girl's pocket. Olivia noticed her name on it and demanded, "Hand it over!"

The gossiping duo froze, realizing they might have dug their own grave with that note. What could possibly be on it that made Olivia so interested?
