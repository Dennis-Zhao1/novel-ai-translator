When Olivia Stewart showed up with her lips swollen like she'd been stung by a bee, little Lily couldn't help but blurt out, "Wow, they're still swollen! They look like mini sausages!"

Olivia almost lost her balance at the comment.

Isabella quickly caught her, scooping her up in his arms and placing her gently on a comfy lounge chair.

Lily, not quite ready to give up, followed them, her big, sparkling eyes full of admiration. She blinked at Isabella, her enthusiasm bubbling over. "Dad, you're amazing! You kissed Mom so much her lips got swollen and she almost fainted!"

Olivia covered her face in embarrassment. "Stop talking about it!"

But Lily, full of curiosity, climbed onto Isabella's lap, wrapping her arms around his, pleading sweetly, "I wanna play kissy too!"

Isabella chuckled, pointing at Olivia's lips. "Do you want sausage lips too?"

"Ew, no way! That's so ugly!" Lily shrieked, quickly covering her mouth and sliding off Isabella's lap to hide next to her twin, Coco.

Olivia, fuming, picked up a stuffed toy and tossed it at Isabella's head, scolding him, "You idiot! What kind of example are you setting for the kids?"

Later that night, back at their cozy mansion, it was already past midnight. Isabella instructed the housekeeper to carry the sleeping twins to their room, while he carried Olivia upstairs himself. After a long day, he was at the end of his patience.

As they reached the second floor, soft cries drifted from the staircase. The housekeeper had accidentally woken Lily.

Rubbing her eyes, Lily realized something was off and started crying for her mom.

Oh, that little mood-spoiler!

Isabella frowned, "Please calm her down!"

The housekeeper whispered soothingly, "Don't cry, Miss Lily. We're almost at your room, and then you can go back to sleep, okay?"

"No, no, I don't want to sleep with you! I want to sleep with Mommy! I want Mommy…" Lily kicked her little legs, refusing to settle down.

The cries woke Olivia, who stirred in Isabella's arms, trying to lift her head to see what was happening, but Isabella gently pressed her head back down.

"Isabella, what's going on? I think I hear… Lily crying?" Olivia mumbled, still half-asleep.

"No, no, the twins are sleeping soundly! It must be the TV downstairs that we forgot to turn off," Isabella fibbed, swiftly carrying her into their bedroom and kicking the door shut.

Lucas, the butler, silently wiped his brow. Geez, boss, did you have to be so eager with all the staff watching?

Meanwhile, Lily, initially upset from being woken up, soon grew tired when no one paid her much attention. Her head drooped, and she drifted back to sleep, blowing little bubbles.

The housekeeper quickly took her back to her room. After a bit of hustle and bustle, the house regained its usual quiet ambiance. However, with Isabella bringing Olivia and the twins back home, the mansion now exuded a subtle air of joy.

Standing in the second-floor hallway, Lucas, with his white hair, maintained a perfect butler stance, hands crossed in front of him, vigilantly ensuring no one disturbed the peace of the household.

If only the master and Olivia could have another pair of twins…

Lucas couldn't help but smile to himself, his wrinkled face breaking into a joyful grin like a blooming flower.

On the third day, with the sun already high in the sky, Isabella and Olivia had yet to get out of bed.

The staff, understanding the situation, quietly went about their duties.

The nanny, responsible for the twins, carefully took them downstairs via the other staircase, heading straight to the multi-flavored dining room.

Since having the twins, Isabella had turned their fairy-tale mansion into a playground for them, complete with a dining area below and various recreational and educational rooms above.

Having previously lived on a ranch with Olivia, the twins had been inseparable from her.

Now that they were back, Isabella planned for them to move into the fairy-tale mansion.

"Wow! It's so beautiful!" Lily exclaimed with wide eyes as she stepped inside.

After seeing nothing but blue skies and white clouds on the ranch, the dreamy ambiance of the fairy-tale world felt almost surreal to her.

Coco, too, took in their surroundings with a keen eye. Although not as openly enthusiastic as Lily, his dark eyes sparkled with delight.

Isabella had designed the fairy-tale mansion with both of them in mind, ensuring it was filled with things Lily loved, as well as everything Coco enjoyed!

A maid dressed in bunny ears approached, bending down with a warm smile. "Little sir, little miss, what would you like for breakfast?"

"I want… um…" Lily thought for a moment. "Just give me a little bit of everything!"

Coco immediately frowned, scolding her, "Can you eat all that? If you become a little piggie, don't say you're related to me!"

"You…" Lily's big eyes blinked, full of anger and frustration. "Brother, you know most of it is for you!"

"I can't eat that much! Don't make me take the blame!" Coco retorted, turning to leave, maintaining a cool demeanor.

Lily pouted, stomping her foot in frustration at Coco's retreating back.

The maids, watching the twins' interaction, couldn't help but stifle their laughter.

Lily wandered into the cartoon-themed dining room and plopped down on a mushroom chair. She spotted a big brother sitting on a Transformer chair in the corner, quietly munching on a burger.

Ever the sociable type, Lily hopped off her chair and cheerfully approached him. "Hey, big brother! Who are you? How did you get here?"

The young man on the Transformer chair turned, his handsome yet delicate face showing clear annoyance.

Why are you here… It was as if he didn't belong there at all.

After attending a boarding school for several years, he rarely returned to the mansion. He'd only come back this time because he'd heard Olivia was coming home…

Well, technically, he should call her Mom, but he was still used to calling her Aunt Olivia.

Deep down, he felt like he didn't quite fit in with this family.

This big brother was none other than Tony!

In the few years he'd been away, Tony had grown a lot taller, losing much of his childishness and becoming more reserved.

For some reason, looking at Lily's soft and bright smile, he had the urge to ruin it.

During his time at the boarding school, he'd had a counselor, but it seemed like the sessions hadn't really helped. If anything, they'd just taught him to hide his darker feelings even more.

Tony tossed the rest of his burger onto the plate, glancing at Lily's innocent face with distaste. "Mind your own business! Get lost!"

"Big brother, how can you be like that?" Lily's big eyes welled up with tears.

She'd always lived in a world of kindness and beauty, surrounded by friendly and kind people, and she'd never faced such rejection before. So, her little heart broke.

"Apologize to her!"

A young voice broke the silence, cold and commanding.

Tony looked up, seeing a cool little boy standing protectively in front of Lily, glaring at him.

Sweeping his gaze over the two children, Tony quickly realized these were his brother and sister—the twins!

However, the twins had no memory of Tony.

After all, when he'd left, they were just a few months old. Three years had passed, and everyone had changed. They weren't old enough to remember him.

Tony's gaze settled on Coco's face.

This kid looked a lot like Isabella.

Technically, he should call him Uncle, but Tony had always rejected that idea.

In Tony's young mind, if it weren't for Isabella, Mom would have stayed with him and Dad, and they'd be a happy family of three!

As he grew older, this resentment only deepened.

Consequently, when Tony looked at Coco, he found him particularly irksome.

"What if I don't apologize?" Tony challenged, looking at Coco with a cold smirk, slowly standing up.

Being five years older than Coco, his height and build gave him an immediate advantage.

Coco, however, clenched his small fists, looking up at Tony without the slightest hint of fear despite the size difference.

On the contrary, Coco exuded an even stronger aura than Tony!

"You must apologize!" Coco demanded, his voice steady and clear.

"Why should I?" Tony sneered.

They were born of the same mother, so why should he have to bow down?

"Because this castle was built by my dad for us!" Coco's words carried a natural pride and confidence.

He didn't know much about adult matters, nor did he realize this cold guy was his brother.

But as a kid, when you didn't have the means, it was all about who your parents were!

However, Coco's words hit Tony where it hurt.

Tony's face turned pale.

A sensitive child who'd endured much, even at eight or nine, understood many things.

Coco's words left him speechless.

Though they shared the same mother, they didn't have the same father.

In this family, he was the outsider—always had been.

Tony tightened his fists, breathing heavily, his delicate face turning red with frustration, his chest heaving with emotion.
