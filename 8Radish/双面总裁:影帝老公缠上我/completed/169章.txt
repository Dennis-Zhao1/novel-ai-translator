The Unexpected Visit from an Ex

Dr. Wang smiled gently, "Olivia, don’t worry! Sophie just has a bad case of food poisoning. After this IV drip and some rest, she should be fine!"

"Oh," Olivia sighed with relief, "Thank you so much!"

"You're welcome!" Dr. Wang tidied up his medical kit and left the room briskly.

Turning to Sophie, Olivia asked with concern, "Sophie, are you feeling any better now?"

"No, sis! I’m so glad you came to see me," Sophie started to say, but then her voice caught, and tears began to fall. "Even though you’ve got so much on your plate, I just keep screwing up. I really hate myself!"

"I'm not bothered at all!" Olivia looked puzzled, "I had a day off from filming, so I was just hanging around at home, feeling a bit bored."

This girl clearly had no idea what was happening!

Sophie’s eyes flashed with frustration, but she quickly looked remorseful, covering her mouth and giving Olivia a pitiful look.

Olivia frowned, "What’s going on?"

Sophie avoided her gaze, "It’s nothing, really!"

Her hesitation only made it seem like there was something embarrassing going on.

Olivia’s frown deepened, her voice rising, "What’s the matter, Sophie? Tell me, is someone giving you trouble?"

"No, no!" Sophie waved her hands, whispering, "It’s you they’re bothering! Sis, it breaks my heart to watch!"

Sophie, despite being hooked up to an IV, reached out and hugged Olivia, her shoulders shaking.

"Who’s bothering me? Look, I’m fine, aren’t I? Sophie, don’t overthink it!" Olivia patted Sophie’s back soothingly, speaking softly, "What’s the real story? Just tell me what’s going on!"

"No, no! I’d rather bite my tongue than say anything!" Sophie stubbornly insisted like a child.

She just needed to pique Olivia’s curiosity; someone else would fill in the blanks.

"Alright, alright, if you don’t want to talk, you don’t have to. Just get some rest." Olivia comforted Sophie until she lay back down, already forming a plan in her mind.

Sophie closed her eyes and soon her breathing became steady.

Olivia sat by the bed, tucking the blanket around Sophie, but she didn’t rush to leave.

Though Sophie’s breathing was even, the slight flutter of her eyelashes betrayed her. However, Olivia was too focused on the IV drip to notice.

Time ticked by, and Sophie was getting restless, almost unable to keep up the pretense.

Olivia, I’m pretending to sleep here, why don’t you go out already? Go find out what’s going on, or at least check the internet! Aren’t you the least bit curious?

If she weren’t pretending to be asleep, Sophie would have pushed Olivia out herself!

Just as Sophie was growing desperate, Olivia’s phone rang.

Olivia glanced at the “sleeping” Sophie, then quickly answered the call, stepping out into the hallway and lowering her voice, "Hello?"

On the other end was a voice dripping with mockery, "Olivia, long time no see!"

"Daniel Johnson!" Olivia almost jumped.

Hearing the name, Sophie couldn’t resist sneaking a peek at Olivia, then turned on her side, eavesdropping with interest.

That idiot! She’d hoped he’d make a move yesterday, but here he was, only now showing up!

Olivia heard Sophie’s movement and, worried she’d disturbed her, lowered her voice even further, "Daniel, what do you want?"

"Olivia, I’ve been thinking about you. How about we meet up for a chat?" Daniel’s voice was teasing.

"I’m busy!" Olivia rejected him flatly, "Even if I had time, I wouldn’t waste it talking to a jerk like you! Daniel, just the sound of your voice makes me sick, so take your nonsense and get lost!"

"Heh! Olivia, seems like fame’s given you quite the temper. But I love that fiery mouth of yours! Just so you know, today, you’ll see me whether you like it or not. I’m at the café east of the set. If you don’t want me to shout your name with a megaphone, you better come out!"

"You…" Olivia was furious, "Daniel, you’re as shameless as ever!"

"Shameless? Once I’ve got money, who needs shame? Olivia, you’re wrapped up in scandals right now; you wouldn’t want to stir up more trouble, would you? What I’ve got could blow everything else out of the water! If you don’t show up in five minutes, I’ll release it!"

Olivia was bewildered, "What scandals? Daniel, stop spouting nonsense!"

"You really don’t know? Or are you playing dumb with me? Just because the traces are gone online doesn’t mean you’re safe. I’ve kept everything, just in case you decide to deny it! Want me to show you?"

With that, Daniel sent over a few screenshots.

Olivia looked at them and her face went pale with anger, her fingers trembling slightly as she held her phone.

No wonder Isabella and the housekeeper had been acting so strange this morning. No wonder her friend called to check on her. The internet had been tearing her apart!

Isabella must have rushed out this morning to handle this mess, right?

As long as the people who love and care about me understand, what do I care about the rest?

Olivia took a deep breath, trying to keep her voice steady, letting out a sarcastic laugh, "Daniel, if it’s already all over the internet, isn’t it too late to threaten me with this?"

"Heh, I never fight unprepared! What you saw yesterday was just an appetizer. It might’ve been cleaned up, but what I’ve got will ensure you never recover! Your current backers will drop you like a hot potato!"

"Daniel!" Olivia’s voice was a growl, teeth clenched.

How could she have been so blind to ever get involved with such a jerk?

"Hahaha…" Daniel's laugh was unrestrained, "You’ve got three minutes left, Olivia!"

"Just wait!" Olivia, though furious, had no choice.

She hung up and rushed out, "Dr. Wang, I need to leave urgently. Could you please keep an eye on Sophie?"

Dr. Wang poked his head out from the medical office, "Of course, Olivia. Your sister’s stable now, and I’ll be right outside."

Olivia dashed out of the room, sprinting towards the east side of the set. On her way, she passed a few crew members who avoided her like the plague, as if she were some kind of monster.

She couldn’t worry about that now, racing out of the set. Earlier, she’d greeted people with her usual cheerful demeanor, though their responses were polite, their eyes seemed odd. She’d been too preoccupied with Sophie to question it, but now she understood.

Right now, the priority was to find out what Daniel wanted. Isabella must be working hard to sort this out, and she couldn’t afford to add to his burden.

Olivia had just left when Isabella arrived. This time, he didn’t bother with a disguise but walked straight in.

A tall and striking guy suddenly appearing on set was enough to turn heads, and the women couldn’t help but stare, someone even gasping, "Wow—so manly and handsome! I think he’s even hotter than Ethan!"

Isabella ignored the swooning looks, grabbing a nearby crew member, "Where’s Olivia?"

The crew member was too dazzled by Isabella’s looks to speak, merely pointing eastward.

Isabella let her go and hurried in that direction.

At the café to the east, Olivia spotted Daniel lounging by the window. She couldn’t fathom how she’d ever thought he was handsome; next to Isabella, he wasn’t even fit to shine his shoes.

Olivia approached, coolly removing her sunglasses, "Daniel, what do you want?"

"Wow, being a big star has really changed you!" Daniel’s eyes lit up, a sleazy grin spreading across his face.

Olivia glanced around, putting her sunglasses back on, her tone icy, "Get to the point!"

"Such a temper!" Daniel teased, smacking his lips, "We did have something special once..."

"Daniel!" Olivia snapped, standing abruptly, "I don’t have time for your nonsense!"

Seeing Olivia’s temper flare, Daniel backed down a little, gesturing to the seat across from him, "Sit, sit! Olivia, you’ve got a reputation to uphold now, don’t blow a fuse. Keep your cool, alright?"

Olivia sat back down, turning her gaze to the window. She couldn’t stand to look at Daniel any longer than necessary.

"What do you want from me? Spit it out!"

"No rush, no rush!" Daniel said leisurely, sliding a cup of coffee towards Olivia, "This café’s coffee is pretty good. Try it, let’s have a chat."
