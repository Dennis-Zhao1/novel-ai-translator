Title: The Rival I Created

Olivia Stewart couldn't believe her ears. Tian Yi, the renowned actor and heartthrob, had just declared at the press conference, "I'll be doing all the scenes myself, no stand-ins, no camera tricks."

The crowd erupted with excitement. The whispers and gasps filled the room. Olivia's eyes widened in surprise, her jaw slightly dropping. 

Tian Yi glanced at her sideways, his voice low and teasing, "Surprised?"

Surprise? Sure. But delighted? Well...

"Heh!" Olivia gave a sheepish laugh. For most women, sharing a scene with Tian Yi would be a dream come true. But all Olivia could think about was how Isabella Peterson, her significant other, would react if she saw Olivia getting cozy with another man on screen.

Tian Yi chuckled, catching Olivia's mixture of shock and apprehension. "I hope we have a pleasant collaboration," he said with a mischievous smirk.

Olivia forced a smile. Oh sure, a "pleasant collaboration," more like an excuse to flirt openly.

Half an hour later, the press conference wrapped up. Olivia, shielded by Michael Wright and a team of assistants, made her way out through a special exit, avoiding the prying eyes of the press.

As soon as she got into the car, Olivia kicked off her high heels with zero grace. "Ugh, my feet are killing me! Being a star is tough!"

"That's why the boss..." Michael started but quickly clammed up, realizing he'd said too much.

"What about the boss?" Olivia asked, her curiosity piqued.

"Nothing, nothing."

Exhausted, Olivia slumped back in her seat, not pressing further. Michael, however, was sweating bullets, glancing at Olivia through the rearview mirror. If he let slip the big secret, there'd be hell to pay.

Just as Michael was starting to relax, Olivia chimed in again, "By the way, did you see your boss at the press conference?"

Tires screeched as Michael hit the brakes, causing Olivia to lurch forward, her head smacking into the seat in front. "Ouch!"

"Sorry, Olivia, my bad," Michael apologized profusely.

"No big deal, just drive carefully," Olivia rubbed her forehead, pondering. "So, Michael, every time I mention your boss, you get all jumpy. What are you hiding from me?"

"Nothing! Absolutely nothing!" Michael shook his head vehemently and, to avoid another blunder, pulled over to the side of the road.

"Is he really on a business trip?" Olivia murmured to herself.

Michael relaxed a bit, thankful Olivia wasn't suspicious. He nearly panicked when she asked about the boss, but it seemed like she was just musing aloud.

"Olivia, our boss has tons of commitments. If he's on a trip, it's definitely important. But you can bet he'll rush back for you. Who knows, he might already be waiting at home!"

"Really?" Olivia's face lit up with hope. "Let's get home then!"

Back at their lavish home, Olivia rushed inside, eager to see Isabella.

Isabella had returned earlier, freshly showered to rid himself of the lingering scent from his work with Tian Yi. He sat casually on the living room sofa, flipping through a financial magazine.

Olivia burst in, her heart leaping at the sight of him. But then, she felt a bit annoyed. He had time to read but not attend her career milestone event?

"Isabella! You're back?" Olivia's voice carried both joy and a hint of hurt.

"Yeah," Isabella replied without looking up, his focus still on the magazine.

Just "yeah"? That's it? Olivia pouted, feeling the flames of annoyance flicker within her.

Isabella Peterson, why didn't you come to my movie premiere?

Olivia wanted to march over, snatch the magazine, and demand answers. But doing so would show just how much she cared about his presence.

As she made her way inside, Olivia feigned nonchalance. "Did you watch the premiere today? That Tian Yi is really something, isn't he?"

Isabella finally lifted his gaze, narrowing his eyes.

Seeing this, Olivia's heart danced. Gotcha, jealous, aren't we?

"That star isn't just handsome; he's really thoughtful and supportive of newcomers," she added, pushing the envelope.

"And how exactly did he support you?" Isabella tossed the magazine aside, his dark eyes fixed on Olivia, his voice betraying no emotion.

When Isabella acted like this, it meant he was definitely jealous, and Olivia was loving every second of it.

Ha, serves you right for not attending!

Olivia smirked inwardly, but outwardly she played coy, "Well, he didn't do much, just..."

Leaving the rest up to Isabella's imagination, she declared, "Anyway, I'm off to shower! Enjoy your reading!"

With a cheeky grin, Olivia dashed upstairs, leaving Isabella sitting there, his handsome face a mask of irritation.

She gets one movie premiere, and she's swooning over Tian Yi? Showing off like a giddy teenager? Seriously?

He'd created a rival for himself, a rival who was, ironically, himself.

Isabella crumpled the magazine, stalking upstairs to wait by the bathroom door.

Inside, Olivia was happily singing to herself, the sound of her cheerful tune barely audible through the door.

Isabella's frown deepened. Olivia, do you think I'm just going to let this slide?

He, usually the epitome of calm and intellect, found himself at odds.

Despite Olivia's fondness for Tian Yi, it was like she was fond of another man entirely. Her liking Tian Yi felt like a betrayal.

Listening to her sing, Isabella grew more agitated, tempted to drag her out and give her a piece of his mind.

He was about to kick the door when it swung open, and a damp-haired Olivia, clad in a bathrobe, stepped out.

Isabella's foot hovered in mid-air, frozen.

Couldn't she give a warning before opening the door?

Luckily, he caught himself in time. Otherwise, his foot would have landed right on her. That would have been a disaster!

"Whoa! Isabella, you scared me!" Olivia exclaimed, leaping back, her face paling at the sight of his poised foot.

"Let's talk things out, no need for domestic violence!"

Isabella withdrew his foot, initially concerned about Olivia's well-being, but seeing her reaction, he quickly donned a stern expression. "Clinging to your movie star crush?"

"Uh... no, not at all!" Olivia shook her head frantically.

In her excitement earlier, she forgot how possessive and petty Isabella could be. Now she'd have to deal with the fallout for riling him up.

What was I thinking? She thought, regretting her earlier bravado.

Isabella noted her regretful expression, feeling a sense of satisfaction.

"Explain yourself."

"What? Explain what?" Olivia mumbled, scratching her head, softening her tone, "Isabella, I was just teasing you earlier. You know, a big star like him wouldn't be interested in someone like me."

"Is that so? If he was interested, you'd jump at the chance?"

"Isabella!" Olivia stomped her foot in frustration. "Do you really think I'm like that?"

"Yes."

"You... fine, think what you want!"

"Usually, when you're guilty, you try to cover it up by being cute or throwing a tantrum."

Olivia felt like she couldn't win. No matter what she did, Isabella found fault. Why did she rile him up in the first place?

Pouting, Olivia fell silent, the pair standing awkwardly by the bathroom door.

Her dripping hair was soaking her robe, revealing more than she realized.

Isabella's gaze lingered, his eyes darkening with an intense emotion.

Just as his feelings were about to boil over, he turned away, his voice husky. "Come here, let's dry your hair."

"Okay," Olivia followed him meekly, looking like a scolded puppy.
