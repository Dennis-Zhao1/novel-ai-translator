Sophie Cook Meets Director Adams

Olivia Stewart shot Sophie Cook a sharp look. "What's going on in that little head of yours?"

"Why won't you introduce me to him?"

"Well, uh..."

Olivia struggled to explain to Sophie. If she and Isabella Peterson were in a real, reliable relationship, she might have introduced him to Sophie. But as things stood, Olivia wasn't even sure what to call their relationship, so she'd kept quiet about it.

"He's out of town for a few days. Maybe later," Olivia said, trying to change the subject. "Besides, shouldn't you be focusing on your final project?"

Out of town? Sophie had seen them snuggled up in his car just yesterday! Olivia, you're even keeping your own sister at arm's length, huh? Sophie thought, smirking internally.

With no chance to meet the elusive rich guy, Sophie decided to try another tactic. She sidled up to Olivia. "Sis, if you won't introduce us, maybe he could do me a small favor?"

Olivia frowned. "What kind of favor?"

Honestly, she wasn't keen on asking Isabella for favors, especially in the entertainment industry, which she knew little about.

Sophie put on a pitiful face. "I've barely made the final selection, and I'm just a backup. It's such an unflattering title! Since your friend is well-connected, maybe he could put in a good word for me with the production team? Get me the lead role?"

"That's... not so easy," Olivia said. She knew Isabella was into software, not real estate, where his family had interests. He never mentioned anything about entertainment.

Sophie's face fell. "So you won't do it? Come on, sis, are you helping me or not? Just be straight with me!"

Olivia sighed. "I'll try my best, but I can't promise anything. He works in software, and I have no idea if he has any connections in entertainment. It's great to have help, but you should also prepare and do your best. That's what's most important, you know?"

Sophie pouted. "Fine, I get it!"

Olivia shook her head, amused by her sister's antics. "Keep at it, I'm rooting for you!"

Sophie rolled her eyes internally. You rooting for me is worthless. If only your fancy guy was rooting for me instead! Olivia, you just got lucky. If that rich guy met me first, he'd definitely pick me over you!

Seeing Sophie's sour expression, Olivia tried to reassure her. "Don't worry, just prepare well. I'll talk to him as soon as I get back, okay?"

Sophie forced a smile. "Okay, that's more like it."

"Alright, I'm off then!"

Sophie waved goodbye with a sweet smile, but the moment Olivia turned away, her face twisted with jealousy and resentment. Olivia, a mere office assistant, had landed such a great guy!

"Hey there, isn't this the beauty here for the auditions?" came a sudden voice from behind. Sophie quickly masked her anger with an innocent smile as she turned around.

Standing there was a middle-aged man, a bit over forty, holding a briefcase and sporting a slight paunch. His balding head gave him a distinctive look.

His small eyes squinted with a smile as he looked Sophie over, and his demeanor was far from comforting.

Sophie felt a wave of nausea but maintained her composure. Just as she was about to dismiss him, he spoke up with a grin. "Your performance today was really memorable!"

"You saw my performance?" Sophie asked, surprised.

"Of course! Which number were you again?"

He tapped his shiny forehead, pretending to think.

"Number nine."

"Ah, yes, number nine! My memory's not what it used to be!"

He slapped his forehead with an exaggerated gesture of realization.

"But seriously, your performance was excellent! Your pure and charming look is perfect for the lead role in our new series!"

Sophie's eyes lit up. "And you are?"

"The name's Adams, Assistant Director of 'Send an Angel to Love You.'"

"But the assistant director at our audition wasn't you, was it?"

"Ah, you don't get it, do you? A big production like ours can't have just one assistant director. Didn't you notice the camera next to the other assistant director during your audition?"

"Yes."

"Then there you go! While Assistant Director Yu was conducting the interviews, I was behind the camera, overseeing things. Out of everyone, you stood out the most. Otherwise, why would I seek you out?"

"Oh, I see! Nice to meet you, Director Adams! I'm thrilled to meet you!"

Sophie, elated, shook Director Adams's rough hand.

"Pleasure's all mine!"

Adams held her hand a beat longer than necessary, his smile wide and toothy.

Sophie's face flushed slightly as she pulled her hand back, her heart pounding. She often fantasized about the give-and-take of the industry, but facing it head-on was nerve-wracking, especially with this sleazy man. If only she’d met the rich guy instead!

Thinking of Olivia being whisked away in that luxury car, Sophie felt a pang of envy.

"What's wrong? That was your friend, right? Got picked up in a fancy car? Is she in the running too? If both of you make it to the finals, you better watch out!" Director Adams hinted.

"Why?" Sophie asked, puzzled.

"She's got connections," Director Adams said, looking at Sophie with mock disappointment.

Sophie's confidence wavered. "You mean that's common?"

"Not too common, but I've already seen four girls picked up in fancy cars today, plus your friend makes five!" Director Adams counted on his pudgy fingers.

"She's... no, I asked her friend for a favor!" Sophie explained.

"Ha! In this world, who helps without getting something in return? I doubt she'd risk anything for you. You really think she'll help you?"

Director Adams shook his head knowingly. "I wouldn't count on it."

His words hit Sophie hard, shattering her already fragile confidence.

"So, what should I do?" Sophie asked, desperate.

Director Adams patted her shoulder. "Don't worry too much! Even though bigwigs always try to influence our casting, the final decision lies with us directors."

Hope sparked in Sophie's eyes as she looked up at Director Adams, suddenly seeing his shiny bald head as a beacon of wisdom.

"So, Director Adams, what do you think of me?" Sophie asked eagerly.

"You're great! Lovely face, pure look, great figure—you're a natural!" Director Adams scrutinized her like a piece of fine art.

"So, could you consider me for the role?"

Sophie grabbed his hand, her voice sweet and slightly childish, enough to melt anyone's heart.

"Of course, I love girls who know how to play the game!"

Adams squeezed her hand, his grin wide and suggestive.

"There's a little gathering in the industry tonight. Why don't you come along? I'll introduce you around. After all, deciding on the lead role isn't up to just me. Everyone needs to be on board, right?"

"Absolutely, Director Adams, you're so right! I've been trying to find a way to meet people in the industry, and having you guide me would be amazing!"

Sophie forced back the waves of nausea rising within her, maintaining a demure and shy smile.

Director Adams rubbed his shiny head, feigning a sigh. "Technically, directors and contestants shouldn't meet privately, but I'm making an exception because I see potential in you. Make sure to seize this opportunity! Here's the place, 9 PM sharp, don't be late!"

With that, he slipped a note into her hand, brushing her fingers slightly, before waddling off, satisfied with himself.

Sophie unfolded the note slowly, revealing a scribbled bar and room number. The handwriting was atrocious, like a failing grade-schooler's.

She scoffed but carefully tucked the note into her purse. She knew all too well what Director Adams's words implied but was willing to take the plunge for her future. 

Sophie smiled, though it was twisted with resentment. Olivia, you're not that special. Once I get the lead role and become a star, I'll have more rich guys than I can count!

In her mind's eye, Sophie saw herself surrounded by wealthy suitors, all vying for her attention.

That evening, Sophie dressed in a light, off-the-shoulder chiffon dress, applied subtle makeup, and made sure she looked her best. She grabbed her purse and headed to the nightclub for the meeting with destiny.
