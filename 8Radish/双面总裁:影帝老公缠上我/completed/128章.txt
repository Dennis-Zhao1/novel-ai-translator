Chapter 1: The Wrong Person to Mess With

"Ow! This is killing me! Get away from me!"

Sophie Cook's cries of pain echoed through the set.

Director Wang looked down at her with a sigh. "Sophie, I'm doing this for your own good. Why can't you appreciate that?"

After several rounds of this, Sophie had become numb from the alcohol-infused pain.

"All done!" The doctor's words were a relief, but just as Sophie breathed a sigh of relief, the doctor reached for another cotton ball.

"What are you doing now?" Sophie questioned.

"Cleaning the wound."

The cotton ball, covered in tiny fibers, clung to her wound, causing a fresh wave of pain every time it was applied. The doctor meticulously cleaned the wound over and over.

Sophie struggled and sweated through the agony, nearly fainting from the pain.

Not too far away, Ethan sat sipping his coffee, watching the scene unfold with an air of casual elegance. Behind him, Amy Green shuddered, unable to stop the chill running down her spine.

"Of all people to cross, why our boss?" she muttered. "And to make things worse, his woman!"

Eventually, all the glass shards were removed from Sophie's wound, and by the time it was bandaged, she was utterly exhausted.

Seeing her in such a state, Director Wang asked, "Olivia, it looks like you can't go on with this scene. Do you want to take a break and head home?"

Sophie nodded weakly. Despite his stern demeanor, Director Wang had some compassion. In her condition, resting seemed like the only option.

"Alright then, pack up and go rest. You don’t have to worry about the rest of your scenes," Director Wang said as he walked away, instructing the crew. "Get a background actor from set two to fill in."

"What do you mean, don't worry about it?" Panic surged through Sophie. Ignoring the pain in her leg, she scrambled up and grabbed Director Wang's arm. "Did you say you're getting a stand-in for me?"

Director Wang looked at her as if she was from another planet. "Sophie, are you confused? Background actors are everywhere. We don't need a stand-in for a maid role. Just replace you. Go home and rest. You'll have other chances."

"No, please, Director Wang. Don't replace me. I can do it! I can redo that scene!"

Her role hadn’t even begun, and she couldn’t be replaced!

"That scene is directly tied to the previous one. It’s crucial for the storyline," Director Wang explained. "We decided to shoot it realistically. We’ll be using real hits, but the stunt coordinators will ensure it’s not too hard."

Sophie gritted her teeth. "If that's what it takes, I’m in!"

She couldn't lose even the maid role. That would mean Olivia Stewart underestimated her!

Staying in this production was her chance to get close to Ethan and turn things around.

Maybe, just maybe, if she collapsed, Ethan would rush to her side like he did for Olivia Stewart.

Sophie let her imagination run wild, her eyes filled with daydreams.

Her intentions were written all over her face. Director Wang shook his head, resigned, and went to inform the crew.

This girl was hopelessly foolish. Did she really think she could win Ethan over that easily? It took more than sympathy to capture his attention.

Soon, the scene where "Bai Yike" angered the young master and got dragged out was shot again. Ethan didn’t appear; Director Wang focused on reshooting the part where Sophie was dragged away.

This time, no glass shards littered the ground, but Sophie’s injured leg was wrapped in a thin bandage. As the two bodyguards roughly dragged her, the bandage quickly stained with dots of red.

Amy Green, watching from the sidelines, couldn't help but wince. "Boss, you really know how to treat a lady, don’t you?"

Ethan paused, responding casually, "Compared to the pain in Olivia Stewart's heart, her injuries are nothing."

Amy took a step back, understanding more than ever: never, ever mess with Olivia Stewart! Crossing Ethan might give you a chance to plead, but angering Olivia could mean a fate worse than death!

After being dragged across the set multiple times, Sophie finally completed the scene.

Regret filled her heart. If she had known, she wouldn’t have been Olivia Stewart’s stand-in. She was suffering the consequences!

Before she could catch her breath, a new scene awaited: a maid being beaten by the matron.

For realism, Director Wang insisted on real hits. The servants brought out two solid wooden paddles. Although they didn’t hit hard, they aimed for her injured leg, making the pain unbearable.

At first, Sophie held back her cries, but eventually, she couldn’t stop her screams and tears.

Director Wang watched until Sophie was at her limit before calling it.

Collapsed on the ground, Sophie propped herself up, glaring at Director Wang with anger.

Was this acting or just a genuine beating?

Before she could voice her protest, Director Wang gave her a thumbs-up. "Sophie, you’re a natural for these intense scenes. Your cries were so convincing!"

Tears welled up in Sophie’s eyes. Convincing? She was genuinely in pain!

"Yes, you’ve got potential. I’ll be sure to nurture your talent!" Director Wang continued.

Sophie swallowed her anger. She had endured the pain, so if it meant getting more opportunities, maybe it wasn’t so bad.

With that thought, she forced a smile. "Thank you, Director Wang!"

"No need to thank me," Director Wang waved dismissively. "Leave your number with my assistant. If we need a stand-in for intense roles in the future, you’ll be my first call!"

Like a hopeful person doused with cold water, Sophie’s hope vanished. She felt cold and lifeless, like a discarded rag doll.

Ethan, still lounging with his coffee, ignored everything, not even sparing a glance.

Sophie caught sight of Ethan’s calm demeanor and let out a silent laugh.

Why did a slight injury to Olivia Stewart cause such concern, while her own pain went unnoticed?

What did Olivia Stewart have that made all the great guys flock to her?

In the end, Sophie was carried out of the set.

Passing by Lisa, Sophie shot her a resentful look.

Lisa, now back in her youthful, charming look, smiled. "Silly girl! You’re unbelievably naive. Do you even know who you’ve offended? Don’t blame me; I’m just following orders."

Sophie shivered, feeling a chill.

If she still didn’t understand what was happening, she was dumber than a rock.

Olivia Stewart, just because I burned you a little, you’re this ruthless?

What shocked Sophie was Olivia’s influence, making even Director Wang follow her orders, turning the entire crew against her!

Clearly, it wasn’t Olivia Stewart’s doing, but the man behind her, who Olivia had wrapped around her finger!

After this rough experience, Sophie learned to play it smart. She aimed to mend fences with Olivia Stewart, avoiding rash actions unless necessary. When she did act, it would be decisive.

Unaware of Sophie’s ordeal, Olivia Stewart returned to the set two days later, fully healed. She insisted on going back, and Isabella Peterson agreed.

Michael Wright drove her to the set, where everyone, from crew to actors, greeted her warmly, leaving her pleasantly surprised.

What changed?

Maybe it was because Ethan was kind to me, and they’re giving him some respect?

Olivia, simple and kind-hearted, smiled back, polite to everyone.

Ethan emerged from his trailer, his expression calm as he glanced at Olivia. "You’re here?"

"Yes, Ethan. Thank you for your help the other day, I’m all better now!" Olivia beamed, her gratitude genuine.

Ethan’s lips curled slightly into a smile. "Good to have you back. Remember, protect yourself. If someone bullies you, fight back."

His words echoed Isabella Peterson’s, who had warned her before she left: "Olivia, listen up. If anyone messes with you, give it back tenfold. Don’t be a punching bag, or I’ll deal with you myself!"

Caught off guard, Olivia scratched her head sheepishly. "With you around, who would dare?"

Ethan couldn’t help but ruffle her hair, to the envy of onlookers.

The day passed smoothly. After filming, Olivia wandered the set, looking for Sophie but found no sign of her. Finally, she approached Director Wang’s assistant.

"Hey, Assistant Xu, is Sophie not here today? Did something happen to her?"
