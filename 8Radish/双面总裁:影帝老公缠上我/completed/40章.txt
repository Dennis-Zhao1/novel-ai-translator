The Lunatic is Here

Isabella Peterson hadn't moved a muscle yet when Olivia Stewart sprinted to the window. She stood on her tiptoes, craning her neck and poking her head out, looking like she was deeply focused on listening. 

She caught it this time; it was definitely Ethan King's voice, calling out, "Olivia Stewart, I'm here to pick you up from work!"

His voice seemed to float, like it was coming from the far side of the lake. 

"That lunatic! He's such a lunatic!" Olivia Stewart laughed, her eyes sparkling like they were filled with starlight.

SLAM! 

Isabella Peterson's hand slammed down on the dining table, startling Olivia Stewart into silence. 

Isabella's face was as dark as a storm cloud, and she glared at Lucas Wright with stormy eyes, demanding, "How did that guy get in here? What are the guards doing?"

Lucas shivered, bowing his head. "M-Madam, Mr. King didn’t trespass into the Watercloud Estate. He's still on the other side of the lake, just outside the woods."

"Then what’s going on?"

"Mr. King is using a powerful remote microphone outside our property line, so we can't really interfere..."

"Pfft!" 

Olivia Stewart couldn't help but laugh. That lunatic was clever; she had to give him that.

"Lucas Wright, make him shut up!" Isabella ordered, her fierce eyes darting to Olivia. "Do you find this funny? Are you proud of yourself? Believe me, if I decide to keep you here, even if he screams his lungs out, it won't matter."

Olivia's smile froze on her face.

Lucas silently turned to leave, pretending he heard nothing.

After a moment, Olivia found her voice again. "Isabella Peterson, you're an educated person, how can you talk like this?"

“So what?” Isabella's temper flared, like a lion with its mane bristling. "I call it being honest!"

Honest, my foot!

"Isabella Peterson, if you really dare to do anything to me, I-I'll..."

"You'll what? Bite me?"

"I'll turn you into a eunuch."

This little thing, she's vicious!

Isabella glared at Olivia, her gaze icy.

Olivia stood her ground, glaring right back at him defiantly.

Their eyes locked, and it felt like sparks were flying between them.

BANG!

Suddenly, a loud noise erupted, and the shouting outside ceased.

Olivia jumped, quickly running to the window to listen, then turned back to Isabella. "What happened?"

Isabella shrugged. "Who knows, maybe the loudmouth ran out of batteries!"

Yeah, right!

"I asked you what that bang was! It was clearly a gunshot! Isabella Peterson, did you... Did you kill Ethan King? You're a murderer! I'll fight you!"

Olivia launched herself like a cannonball, crashing into Isabella's chest and seeing stars. "Oof..."

Isabella looked down at her with a superior expression. "Olivia Stewart, you think you can take me on? If you want revenge for your friend, I'll teach you a way: drag me to bed and wear me out."

"You..."

Olivia's hands clenched into little fists by her sides, her eyes glaring fiercely at Isabella, growing redder by the moment.

"If you've really hurt Ethan King, I will hate you forever!"

Isabella's eyes glinted darkly as she bit out her words, "Is he that important to you?"

"Yes! You never had a friend, so you don't understand what it's like to care about someone!"

Ha, he doesn’t understand caring about someone? How much he cares about her, is she blind?

Throwing his pride on the floor, letting her trample over it again and again, was this what Uncle Joy said about pursuing a woman without shame?

Isabella's lips curled in a mocking smile, kicking over a chair as he turned to leave.

Lucas Wright entered just as Isabella stormed out, quickly bowing. "Madam..."

Isabella ignored him, striding out of the glass-arched door.

Lucas looked at Olivia in confusion. "What happened to Madam?"

Olivia blinked her tear-swollen eyes. "Lucas, what did you do to Ethan King? That noise just now..."

Lucas suddenly understood and smiled warmly. "Olivia, you misunderstood. That wasn't a gunshot; it was cannon fire."

"Cannon fire!"

No wonder it was so loud!

They actually used a cannon on Ethan King; wouldn't he be blown to bits?

Olivia's face turned white as a sheet, her lips trembling. "How could you..."

Lucas, seeing her terrified look, quickly explained, "Olivia, it's not what you think. Your friend is fine!"

"Fine?" Olivia's face lit up with hope, then fell again. "Lucas, you don't have to comfort me."

They used a cannon; how could he be fine?

"Olivia, I'm not lying, really! We just wanted to give Mr. King a little scare. The cannon was to trigger a local rainstorm."

What?

A rainstorm!

"There was a rain cloud over the woods. We planned a rainstorm to give Mr. King a hard time, but the cannon scared him so much he fell out of a tree."

Olivia facepalmed. "Uh... is he okay?"

"He can walk, so probably nothing serious."

Olivia relaxed. "Lucas, can I call him?"

Lucas looked at Olivia apologetically. "I'm sorry, Olivia, since your friend is fine, shouldn't you check on Madam?"

Olivia suddenly remembered yelling at Isabella, and maybe she was a bit harsh.

But does he have to be so sensitive?

"Lucas, I still want to call Ethan King first. If you're worried, I can do it right in front of you. After all, he came because of me, and with the rain, he can't stay in the woods all night. I'm staying here tonight, so I should tell him, right?"

Lucas grinned like a Buddha statue. "Olivia is staying with my Madam?"

What does he mean, staying with his Madam?

Olivia helplessly spread her hands. "Isabella won't let me go, can I leave? But I don't want to drag anyone innocent into this. Ethan King is a good, reliable friend. I don't want to hurt him or lose him, can you understand?"

Lucas pondered for a moment. "Alright, you can call. But I suggest you tell Mr. King not to come between you and Madam. I'm afraid if Madam really loses control, it won't be good for him. Also, please don't always defend Mr. King in front of Madam. Haven't you noticed? Madam is jealous!"

Jealous?

All this fuss, Isabella's anger was because... he was jealous!

Olivia didn't know what to say, but deep down, she felt a tiny bit of joy, like steam rising from a boiling pot, impossible to suppress.

Using Lucas's phone, Olivia called Ethan King in front of him.

"Hey, Olivia, are you alright? I went to the gym looking for you; they told me everything. It's late, I'm here to take you home!"

Ethan's voice was loud, rain pouring audibly in the background. Olivia glanced at the dark sky outside, imagining how drenched he must be.

For a moment, she felt both touched and guilty.

Olivia pressed her lips together. "Lunatic, just go home! It's pouring, I'm staying here tonight."

"What? Olivia, that Isabella..."

"Don't worry, I told you, he's a neat freak, wouldn't dream of doing anything to me. Besides, you know I like handsome guys. Isabella's a bit of a jerk, but he's good-looking and rich. You always say I should start a new romance; shouldn't you be cheering me on with such a catch?"

Olivia teased.

There was silence on the other end, just the sound of pouring rain.

After what felt like forever, when Olivia thought Ethan might have fallen asleep, his voice came through again, hoarse but lighthearted. "If that's the case, Olivia, go for it. As long as you like it, I'm behind you!"

His voice was hoarse, trying to sound nonchalant.

"Lunatic, go home, don't catch a cold!"

"Okay, since you're busy with a handsome guy, I won't keep you. But if you don't like staying at the castle, come back to the apartment."

"Okay."

Olivia's nose stung.

"Lunatic, it's dark, don't wander the woods. There's a bridge that leads straight out..."

"Ahem!"

Lucas coughed loudly.

There was indeed a shortcut from the Watercloud Estate, a bridge hidden among trees, looking like a green corridor from afar.

But that was Madam's private passage.

Olivia couldn't finish, staring sadly at the phone screen.

Ethan had already hung up.

For the first time since they met, Ethan hung up on her first.

For some reason, the Ethan who used to laugh and chat about clothes, snacks, and guys seemed different.

While Olivia was lost in thought, Lucas brought a silver tray over, placing it in her hands. "Madam barely touched dinner; why don't you take the dessert up to him?"

Olivia looked at the dessert, swallowing hard.

I didn't even get to eat much, okay?

So much, aren't you afraid he'll burst?

Lucas put a silver spoon in the tray, his face full of wrinkles shaking with laughter. "Go on, Madam's probably on the top floor."
