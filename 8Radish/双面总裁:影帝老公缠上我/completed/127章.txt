This Play is Tough

"No matter what she's done wrong, no matter how much she resents me, she's still my sister. She's my only family in this world, and I don't want anything to happen to her! Besides, when our mom was on her deathbed, I promised her I'd take care of her. Over the years, I've spoiled her too much, and I'm partly responsible for how she's turned out."

"Enough! Olivia Stewart, you're just a regular woman, not some kind of saint! Why do you have to take on the responsibility of raising her? Why do you always blame yourself for everything? Back then, you were just a kid too, with no obligation to raise her! Now that she's eighteen, you definitely have no obligation!"

"Isabella Peterson, don't get so worked up; it's bad for your health! I'm just afraid you'll go after her. Acting is her biggest dream, and now she's only landed a small role. It's understandable she'd feel unbalanced. Besides, today, she might have really just made a mistake."

Isabella raised an eyebrow, "Do you believe that?"

Olivia lowered her eyes, "Besides you, I can endure anything, give her anything!"

Isabella suddenly felt a dull ache in her chest, like someone had just struck her hard.

He reached out, carefully avoiding Olivia's burn, and pulled her into his arms, his chin gently rubbing against the top of her head, his voice hoarse, "You fool!"

"Isabella, promise me you won't go after her!"

"Okay."

Yeah, right! No way am I letting her get away with hurting my girl!

Olivia soon received a notice from the production team, telling her to rest at home for a few days until her burn healed. Olivia thought her burn wasn't a big deal, but with the bossy guy by her side, she happily agreed.

The next day, Isabella surprisingly didn't stay home with the injured Olivia but left early in the morning.

Given Isabella's mysterious schedule, Olivia didn't think much of it.

On set, Sophie Cook sat quietly in the corner, feeling anxious.

After yesterday's incident, Sophie had become the laughingstock of many around her. They thought she was foolish because her little stunt backfired, making Isabella even more attentive to Olivia, personally carrying her to the hospital. Some even speculated that the sisters had orchestrated the whole thing.

Sophie spent the night at home, reflecting on the grudges between her and Olivia, finally realizing the root of the problem and feeling deep regret, like she'd wasted her chances with Benjamin Murphy.

With the trust and care Olivia once showed her, what couldn't she have achieved?

Now that Olivia had a strong backer, why was she going against her at this time?

How could she get Olivia to forgive her?

Lost in thought, Sophie didn't hear Director Wang's voice blaring from the loudspeaker, "Sophie Cook, come over here!"

"Sophie Cook! Sophie Cook!"

After several calls, Sophie finally snapped out of it, "Huh?"

Someone next to her nudged her, "Director Wang is calling you; hurry up!"

Sophie rushed over, "Director Wang, you wanted to see me?"

Director Wang looked Sophie over and cleared his throat, "Well, since Olivia got hurt yesterday, and the production schedule is tight, we can't afford to stop. You're her sister, and you look quite similar, so I was thinking, how about you be her stand-in for the next few days? Are you willing?"

Sophie was overjoyed, "Of course, I'm willing!"

Director Wang looked serious, "Sophie, maybe you should reconsider. This part is quite challenging, and we were planning to hire a stunt double."

"No need for that; I'm the best stand-in!"

Sophie patted her chest confidently, "Don't worry, I was top of my class at the academy. No scene is too difficult for me!"

"Alright, go prepare. I have high hopes for you!"

Director Wang's smile was full of meaning.

Sophie quickly realized just how "challenging" the scenes were!

"Attention, everyone! Scene thirty-nine, ready—action!"

With Director Wang's call, several cameras focused on the actors in the scene.

"White Yike" wore a pink nurse's outfit, carrying a tray as she approached "Gu Qianyi," speaking softly, "Mr. Gu, how are you feeling today? Shall I take your temperature?"

"Get lost!"

With a simple flick of his hand, "Gu Qianyi" knocked the tray out of "White Yike's" hands, scattering thermometers, syringes, and other items onto the floor.

"Snap!"

As the thermometer hit the floor, it shattered, sending sharp glass shards flying, slicing "White Yike's" leg, with crimson blood trailing down her pale calf.

"Ouch—"

"White Yike" cried out in pain, about to call for a halt when "Gu's Mom" burst in, "Who told you to upset my son? You're supposed to be a nurse! Don't you know he can't handle emotional stimulation?"

"No, I..."

"Someone, take her away and teach her a lesson!"

Two bodyguard-like figures rushed over, grabbing "White Yike's" arms and unceremoniously dragging her away.

Since it was just acting, they wouldn't really hit her, but the floor still had glass shards from earlier. Being dragged across them, "White Yike's" legs were covered in small cuts, with blood flowing from countless tiny wounds like streams.

"Ah! Let me go!"

"White Yike" screamed, hoping Director Wang would call cut.

But everyone seemed too absorbed in the scene to pay her any mind, and the bodyguards continued to drag her.

"Bastards! Let me go! I'm done with this scene! Get off me!"

"White Yike" cried, cursing through tears.

"Cut!"

With Director Wang's call, the two bodyguards released "White Yike," marking the end of the scene.

Sophie lay on the ground like a discarded rag, taking a while before shakily getting up, her eyes red and her voice shrill, "That was too much! How could you do this?"

"What happened?"

Director Wang approached, seeing Sophie's bloody legs, and was startled, "Oh, how did you get hurt?"

Sophie trembled with anger.

"Didn't you see? My legs are covered in cuts, bleeding all over, and you didn't notice?"

Director Wang smacked his forehead, "Oh my, I didn't notice! I thought it was fake blood! Besides, your performance was so convincing I couldn't bear to call cut."

Darn it!

"But the script didn't have any of this extra drama!"

To make the most of her stand-in role, Sophie had gone through the script thoroughly beforehand. It only included Mr. Gu's indifference to White Yike, and then White Yike's gentle attempt to win him over. Yet, once she was on set, the plot took such a dramatic turn—it was utterly unfair!

Seeing Sophie's face, a mix of grievance and resentment, Director Wang thought to himself: Who told you to offend someone important?

However, his face showed genuine sympathy and guilt, "I did mention the scene was challenging, didn't I? You insisted on trying it out. To evoke audience sympathy, we decided to add some dramatic tension. We failed to inform you on time, which was our oversight. But your unawareness helped you get into character, making your performance more authentic and impactful!"

Sophie couldn't find a rebuttal, swallowing her frustration and pain, she asked through gritted teeth, "So, did I pass this scene?"

"Great, really great! But..."

Hearing those two words, Sophie's heart leaped into her throat.

"If you had held on for just a few more seconds, the scene would have been perfect, but you cursed at the last second, so we'll have to redo it!"

"Redo?"

Sophie shuddered, her voice trembling.

"Don't worry, we'll clean the floor thoroughly this time, making sure it doesn't happen again! Meanwhile, get your wounds treated, and we'll try again later!"

Sophie had no choice but to limply walk to the side of the set and sit down.

The on-set doctor brought over a medical kit and shook his head at the sight of Sophie's small but numerous cuts.

Sophie panicked, ignoring the pain, she asked, "Is it serious?"

"Not too serious, but we can't be sure there aren't glass fragments in the wounds. We need to clean them with alcohol repeatedly. If there's any glass left, it could lead to an infection, and then you might have real trouble with your leg."

"Then clean it, hurry!"

"It might hurt a bit; you'll need to bear with it!"

The doctor said, taking a large bottle of alcohol, unscrewing the cap, and pouring it directly onto Sophie's wounded calf.

"Ah—ah—"

Sophie shook with pain, crying and screaming, her shrill cries echoing painfully across the set, causing everyone to wince and cover their ears.

This wasn't just a little pain!

Cleaning wounds with alcohol was a hundred times, a thousand times more painful than being cut by glass!

"Get away! Stop washing it! I'd rather lose the leg than go through this!"

Sophie cried out, desperately trying to push the doctor's hands away.

"No way! If your wounds get infected and scar, how will you act in the future? You're such a promising talent; I can't let you give up on yourself. It'd weigh on my conscience! Someone, hold her down; we need another round of cleaning!"

At Director Wang's order, stunt doubles quickly moved in, holding Sophie firmly so she couldn't move an inch.

The doctor opened another bottle of alcohol, pouring it over her leg wounds—
