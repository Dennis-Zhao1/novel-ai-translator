Title: The Rental Girlfriend Agreement

Olivia Stewart found herself stuck in the opulent mansion known as Water's Edge, and Isabella Peterson was conspicuously absent, not showing up once to face her.

Days passed by slowly. Every time Olivia saw Lucas Wright, she couldn't help but ask, "Lucas, when can I leave this place?"

Lucas, the ever-patient butler, would respond with a cryptic smile, "Olivia, have you ever considered that you might actually be the person we're talking about, just with a bit of memory loss?"

"Are you joking?" Olivia retorted, clearly exasperated.

"Olivia, why be so insistent? Don't you like it here at Water's Edge?"

"I do, it's beautiful. But walking around with someone else's identity makes me feel like I'm living a lie!"

Lucas shook his head, amused at her stubbornness, which reminded him of his young master. For the next couple of days, he avoided Olivia whenever possible.

Frustrated and determined, Olivia finally cornered Lucas, skipping the usual questions. "Where's Isabella Peterson? I need to see him!"

Unknown to Olivia, Isabella had been there all along, watching her from the shadows. Her repetitive questioning and visible transformation from hope to despair gnawed at him like a thousand tiny ants biting his heart, until he was numb.

On the third day, Isabella finally appeared before her, his demeanor as cool and commanding as ever. "You wanted to see me?"

Olivia didn't mince words. "When are you going to let me go?"

"When you remember who you truly are."

"Isabella, are you out of your mind? I passed the lie detector test! I am Olivia Stewart!"

Suddenly, Isabella was in her space, pinning her against the wall, his gaze dark and intense. "Seems like we need to revisit some memories."

Olivia's bravado faltered, and she waved her hands defensively. "No, no need! Just give me a hint."

With a mischievous grin, Isabella reached for the zipper of her jacket, slowly pulling it down. Olivia's hand shot out to stop him. "Hey, you can't do this! There are people watching!"

Without missing a beat, Isabella ordered the servants to leave with a sharp look. "Everyone, out!"

That wasn't the point!

Desperate, Olivia clung to her clothes. "Isabella, you better have a good reason for all this, or I’ll think you’re just a bully! Tell me, what happened between us five years ago?"

"You want a reason? Lucas!"

Lucas handed Isabella a stack of papers with a bow. Isabella slapped them onto Olivia’s chest. "This is what we were five years ago."

Olivia glanced at the bold title: "Rental Girlfriend Agreement."

Rental girlfriend? No way!

She exclaimed, "There's no way I would do something like that! How could I forget something so big?"

Flipping through the pages, the fresh smell of ink hit her.

"Isabella, did you just print these?"

"Yes."

"You liar!" Olivia snapped, shoving the papers back at him. So much for past relationships—just newly printed blank contracts.

"Did you really forget signing this with me?" Isabella approached, lifting her chin with a firm grip. "Forget it, we can rekindle the past right now!"

Wait, what?

"What do you mean?" What rekindling? Was this some ghostly romance drama?

"Isn't this the reason to stay? Sign it, stay, and be my rental girlfriend."

"No way!" Olivia's face turned from pink to white to crimson, her big eyes glaring at Isabella, her chest heaving with indignation. "Why would I need to look at the terms?"

"No need! You just want to throw money at me. You think just because you’re rich, you can buy anything? Do you really believe your money can make any woman fall for you?"

Isabella's gaze was inscrutable, a hint of a cold smile playing on his lips, his expression cutting through Olivia's resolve.

"I'll give you time to think about it."

"No need!" Olivia snapped back instantly. "Even if you gave me a mountain of gold, I wouldn't agree!"

Isabella lounged on a chair brought over by the servants, elegantly crossing his legs. He stared at Olivia with a wicked smile. "Sweetheart, your logic is worrisome. Let me do the math. As a barista, you earn just enough to scrape by. Lucas, what's the average deficit?"

Lucas, calculator in hand, murmured, "According to city standards, negative twenty-five thousand."

"More grueling than a marathon! Now, if you were my girlfriend, Lucas, tell her the perks."

"Certainly, sir. Olivia, as per the agreement, once it’s effective, the monthly stipend includes a living allowance of one million, spending money of another million, jewelry budget of one million, clothing allowance of one million, and two million for cosmetics..."

"Stop!" Olivia interrupted, feeling overwhelmed by the avalanche of wealth being promised.

Isabella's gaze was playful. "Afraid you'll be tempted?"

"Money is tempting, sure," Olivia admitted, meeting his eyes. "But temptation doesn't always lead to action."

"Oh?"

"I'm not foolish. The difference between being a barista and being your girlfriend is obvious. But no matter how tough it gets, I’d rather sell my labor than my body. I'd rather struggle with rent than compromise myself!"

Isabella clapped slowly, standing tall and leaning close to her, his voice a seductive whisper. "Then what did you sell when you signed this agreement with me back then?"

Olivia's face went pale.

Isabella lifted a long, clean finger, tapping her chest. "I want your body, but I also want your soul."

His words sliced through her resolve like a knife.

Olivia shivered slightly, unable to speak.

Isabella stepped back, his smile dangerous. "Think about it, sweetheart. I think you'll sign."

With that, he turned and left.

Olivia stood there, like a wounded animal abandoned in the twilight wilderness, lost and helpless.

The wind scattered the papers around her. Lucas collected them, offering them back to Olivia. "Olivia, think it over. The terms are generous. Angering the master won’t do you any good."

Numbly, Olivia took the papers, her eyes unfocused. Isabella's words echoed in her mind, a haunting spell tearing her apart.

When had she ever signed such a degrading agreement with Isabella Peterson?
