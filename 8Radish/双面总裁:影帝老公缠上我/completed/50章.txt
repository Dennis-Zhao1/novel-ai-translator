Working Out with Grandpa

"Seriously, do you even know how to make small talk anymore? It's called chit-chat, Olivia. Ever heard of it?"

Olivia Stewart kept her awkward smile plastered on her face, trying to fill the silence. "So, uh... have you been working out lately?"

Isabella Peterson raised an eyebrow, looking a bit bemused. Olivia had been away for a week, probably flirting with some guy, living her best life. If Isabella hadn't chased that pretty-boy away, Olivia might have forgotten she ever signed up as his personal trainer. Since when did she care about his workouts?

"You need a coach to work out, don't you think?" Isabella replied coldly, not bothering to hide her annoyance from Olivia.

"Well, I'm back now, aren't I?" Olivia kept grinning awkwardly, trying to break the ice. "I mean, I'm no pro, but I can at least spot you and hand you a towel."

Spotting and handing towels... Isabella imagined the scene and decided it wasn't so bad. With that thought, she turned and headed upstairs, Olivia following eagerly behind her.

On the fifth floor, Isabella's private gym was massive and luxurious, taking up the entire level. It was filled with top-notch equipment, way better than any fancy fitness club. With a setup like this, who needed a public gym anyway? Crazy!

While Olivia was marveling at the gym, a buff guy in a tank top and track pants approached them. His muscles practically screamed 'fitness expert.' He walked up to Isabella and gave a respectful nod.

"Isabella, are we doing the usual today, orâ€”"

"You can take a break," Isabella interrupted him coolly.

Olivia, sensing something was up, pointed at the guy and asked, "Is he your trainer?"

"Yes," Isabella said at the same time the guy said, "No."

Olivia looked between them, confused about what was going on.

"You're fired," Isabella said to the trainer, whose face fell. He nodded and left the gym without a word.

"Why'd you do that?" Olivia asked, bewildered.

Isabella stared at her, brows furrowed. Olivia had been ogling the trainer's muscles just now, and now she was acting like she was defending him. What was her deal?

"He looked kinda familiar," Olivia pondered, not noticing Isabella's displeasure. Suddenly, her eyes widened in realization. "Oh my gosh, isn't he that famous trainer everyone talks about? What's his name, Ray or something?"

Isabella's face darkened instantly. Did Olivia have to know so much about other guys? Did she have to look so starry-eyed and dreamy about it? Ugh!

Olivia, oblivious to Isabella's mood, lamented, "I heard he's really hard to book and super expensive. Isabella, you really shouldn't have let him go!"

"Regret it, do you?" Isabella asked, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

"Of course, I mean... uh, I'm saying, I've heard he can help anyone achieve the perfect body. I'm, uh, just feeling bad for you," Olivia stammered, realizing the tension in the air.

"Feeling bad for me?" Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

"Really, really!" Olivia nodded vigorously, trying to appease him.

"Save your concern. My body is already perfect," Isabella declared with a hint of arrogance.

What a conceited tone! Olivia wanted to argue, "If you're so perfect, why even bother working out?" But she swallowed her words, remembering why she was there.

"Okay! As long as you don't regret it," Olivia said with a smile. "Honestly, I don't know much about fitness, so I can't compare to him."

"You do have one thing over him," Isabella noted.

"What?"

"You're a woman."

And what does that even mean? Olivia decided not to press further, knowing Isabella's comments wouldn't be pleasant.

Isabella strode into the gym, "You don't need to know much. Just spot me and hand me towels."

"Got it," Olivia nodded, following him obediently.

Suddenly, Isabella turned around, eyeing her outfit with disdain. "Change out of that! It's so dated and frumpy, like a sack."

Such a sharp tongue! Olivia was speechless. When she used to wear trendy outfits to work, Isabella complained they were too flashy. Now that she dressed conservatively, he still wasn't happy!

She wanted to pry open his head and check if his brain was wired wrong. But Isabella's intense gaze left no room for argument.

"I don't have any spare clothes," Olivia shrugged helplessly.

Isabella coolly pointed to a nearby locker room. The message was clear.

Inside, Olivia found a tank top and some embroidered shorts. She picked up the silky tank, feeling like it might rip at any moment. This guy complained about her wearing a T-shirt and shorts, and now this?

Looking around, she realized these were the least revealing options. The rest were practically bikinis.

Sighing, Olivia changed into the outfit, surprised it fit perfectly. Was this Isabella's doing? His tongue might be sharp, but his eye for detail was sharp too!

When Olivia stepped out, Isabella was leaning casually against the doorframe, waiting. His eyes lit up at the sight of her, as if he could burn holes in her thin tank top with his gaze.

Feeling self-conscious, Olivia looked away, her cheeks turning a rosy pink.

"Let's go," Isabella said, this time walking beside Olivia instead of ahead, occasionally glancing her way.

Olivia's heart raced, avoiding eye contact with Isabella. She didn't realize that with the height difference, Isabella had a perfect view down her neckline.

A smirk played on Isabella's lips. He had missed her these past days, even if he was still holding a grudge. Keeping her close, like a pet, was enough to lift his spirits.

Isabella soon changed into his workout gear, a tight black tank and pants that accentuated his sculpted physique. His look was lean and muscular, the kind that made it hard to look away.

Olivia gawked, eyes wide. Compared to the muscle-bound trainer, she preferred Isabella's lean, athletic build. His muscles weren't bulky but firm and elastic, making her want to poke them.

Olivia swallowed hard. Isabella noticed, amused.

"You checking me out?" he teased.

"What? No, I just... noticed how toned your muscles are," Olivia blushed, gesturing vaguely.

"Didn't expect you to be so shameless," Isabella chuckled.

"I..." Olivia was at a loss for words.

"Go ahead, touch," Isabella offered. "Where do you want to start?"

Olivia pointed at his arm. "The muscles. People say they're rock-hard. I just want to see."

"There are muscles here too. Want to check them out?" Isabella suggested, looking down.

Olivia followed his gaze, blushing furiously. "You perv!"

Isabella chuckled at her embarrassment, pinching her red ear lightly. "Look at you blush. One day, I'll train you well."

Olivia kept her head down, too shy to respond.

Isabella, finding her reaction amusing, started his workout routine, leaving Olivia to watch and occasionally wipe his sweat.

She couldn't help but admire his form. Every move, every squat or push-up seemed to highlight his strength and grace.

Even after several sets on the machines, Isabella wasn't winded, just glistening with a light sheen of sweat.

"Towel," Isabella called, his back to Olivia.

She stood there, entranced by him, until his voice snapped her back to reality. Catching his teasing eyes, she blushed like a ripe tomato.

"What? Oh, uh, what did you say?" she stammered.

"Towel," Isabella repeated patiently.

Olivia hurriedly fetched a towel, handing it to him.

Isabella didn't take it, instead nodding toward his face. "Wipe it for me."

Watching him work out was one thing, but now she had to touch him...
