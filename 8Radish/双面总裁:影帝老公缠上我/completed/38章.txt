Olivia Stewart was caught off guard as Isabella Peterson abruptly pulled over their sleek sports car onto the shoulder, hazard lights flashing like a scene out of a dramatic movie. Her face still held a hint of confusion, perfectly paired with her innocent and captivating features. It was the kind of look that could make any guy stop in his tracks, irresistibly drawn to flirt or shower her with affection.

"Isabella Peterson, why did you..." Olivia started to question, but her words faltered midway. Isabella, without warning, reached out and took her hand in his.

His hand was large, not rough, yet carried that distinct masculine texture, enveloping her smaller hand entirely. The warmth of his touch sent a shiver through her, like a jolt of electricity shooting down her spine. She instinctively tried to pull away, but Isabella held firm—not painfully so, but with enough strength that she couldn't break free.

Then, he leaned in, lifting her hand to his lips, and brushed a gentle kiss across the back of it. Olivia froze, staring at him in disbelief.

"Does it still hurt?" Isabella's voice was low, filled with regret as his dark eyes met hers. He had pulled over just to check if her hand was okay? Wasn't that a bit much? But, annoyingly enough, she couldn't help but love it. She desperately wanted to fall for him.

Isabella didn't release her hand right away. Instead, he gently traced his thumb across the still-red marks on her skin—a reminder of when he'd slapped her earlier.

"I'm sorry I was too rough. But you can't be so reckless anymore. I can't always guarantee your safety," he said, his voice tinged with concern.

Olivia was taken aback. His earlier anger had been out of worry for her safety? She couldn't bring herself to look him in the eye, afraid that one glance would cause her to lose herself completely.

If Isabella had remained his usual arrogant, cold, and domineering self, she could handle it. But now, with this sudden change to being so tender and considerate, it was driving her crazy!

Her heart pounded uncontrollably, racing fast enough for her to feel it in her chest.

"In the past, you always looked after me, worried on my behalf. From now on, let me take care of you," Isabella declared, his words echoing in her mind. Olivia froze, feeling as if she'd been doused with a bucket of cold water.

Although he hadn't called her by another woman's name, she knew those words were meant for someone else. He had this way of getting under her skin, just when she thought she had her emotions in check. And when she was on the verge of falling, he'd pull the rug out from under her.

Isabella quickly noticed Olivia's change in demeanor, and realizing his slip, he composed himself. Yet, he said nothing more, simply letting go of her hand and giving her a gentle pat on the head before returning to driving.

It felt like being patted like a puppy. Was this his idea of comfort?

The sports car smoothly rejoined the road, and the two rode in silence all the way back to the grand estate. Once there, Isabella led Olivia back to her pink princess-style room. The staff greeted them warmly, "Good day, young master!" "Hello, Olivia Stewart!"

Olivia forced a polite smile, nodding in return to each greeting. At least they didn't call her by someone else's name anymore, which was a small relief.

The nearer they got to the castle, the more staff they encountered. Isabella strode ahead, turning back when he noticed Olivia lagging behind, exchanging pleasantries with the servants. He frowned, "Why all the fuss? Just walk."

Olivia caught up with him, giving him a sideways glance, "It's called manners, ever heard of it?"

"They're servants. Greeting their master is basic etiquette!" he replied, slipping back into his authoritative demeanor now that they were back at the estate.

Olivia rolled her eyes, "You're their master, not me. They're working under you, just like I am. Technically, that makes us colleagues."

"Olivia Stewart, must you speak like that? I never realized you saw yourself so lowly," Isabella retorted, standing on the staircase, looking down at her.

He already towered over her, and now, with the added height of the stairs, the gap seemed even more pronounced.

Olivia felt a twinge of bitterness, biting her lip to keep from responding. Isabella might not call her by another name now, but he often treated her as if she were someone else. It was an uncomfortable feeling.

She wanted to shout, "Dude, I'm done playing your games!"

Lucas Wright, the butler, quickly stepped in as they entered, bowing to Isabella, "Good day, young master!"

Isabella grunted, clearly still irritated.

Lucas then turned to Olivia with a warm smile, "Olivia Stewart, you're back?"

"What do you mean, back? I'm here to work. From now on, we're colleagues," she replied, throwing a challenging glance at Isabella.

Isabella's eyes narrowed, "If you're here to work, then act like it. Upstairs, now!"

"For what?"

"To sleep!"

Lucas Wright discreetly retreated, leaving Olivia blushing furiously. She remembered how, in the car, Isabella's words nearly led to a disaster. She was both annoyed and embarrassed.

"Isabella Peterson, I'm just your personal trainer, not here to sleep with you!"

"You're overthinking it," Isabella replied coldly, as if amused by her reaction. "I just want to catch up on some sleep. That place last night was so uncomfortable I didn't sleep a wink. Unless, on your first day, you can't wait to seduce your boss?"

Olivia was mortified. Was she overthinking? Anyone would get the wrong idea with the way he phrased things!

But she knew better than to argue. Experience taught her that debating with him led nowhere.

"Even if you wanted to seduce me, I wouldn't be interested!" Isabella said, smirking. "If anyone's going to, it'd be someone like that daring E-girl. I'd rather be smothered by her!"

Was he implying she was too plain for him? Who made her wear this ridiculous sumo suit anyway?

Seeing Olivia's embarrassed and frustrated expression, Isabella strutted upstairs, satisfied with himself.

Lucas Wright reappeared, "Olivia Stewart, your room is just as you left it. The young master made sure everything's ready for you, even had the staff prepare it for your return nap."

So, he wanted her to nap because of that? Olivia was thoroughly flustered, nodding at Lucas, "Thanks!"

After lunch, Isabella busied himself in his study while Olivia lounged under the garden trellis, playing with the custom phone he'd given her. It was top-notch, except for one thing—it couldn't make calls.

Being with Isabella all day felt like being under house arrest.

She played a few games, but couldn't muster any enthusiasm. Feeling restless, she wandered out of the greenhouse, inadvertently finding herself at the edge of the estate, in a lush green space.

The gardens between the estate houses were beautifully designed, each with unique themes that complemented one another, offering a visual feast.

The air was filled with a delicate, refreshing fragrance.

Taking a deep breath, Olivia walked towards the gardens, where she spotted several staff tending to the plants. Among them was Alisa, her former personal maid during her first visit.

What was she doing here?

"Alisa!" Olivia called out.

Startled, Alisa dropped the heavy watering can she was holding, which landed painfully on her foot, making her cry out.

Olivia rushed over, "Are you okay, Alisa?"

"I'm fine," Alisa replied, standing with the help of others, slightly limping, avoiding Olivia's gaze.

"Alisa, weren't you working inside the estate? How did you end up here?" Olivia asked, puzzled.

Alisa glanced at Olivia briefly before lowering her head, silent.

Suddenly, Olivia realized, "Is this because I borrowed your phone last time and got you in trouble?"

Alisa's head dropped lower, "The young master wanted to fire me, but Lucas Wright pleaded on my behalf. I was spared and sent to do labor outside."

"I'm so sorry, Alisa. I'll talk to Isabella and ask him to lift the punishment," Olivia promised.

"Thank you, Olivia Stewart," Alisa said, though her eyes briefly flashed with resentment.

Determined, Olivia hurried back to the estate, heading straight for Isabella's study.

Lucas Wright was stationed outside the door, smiling broadly at her approach, "Olivia Stewart!"

"Is Isabella inside? I need to speak with him!" Olivia asked urgently.

"He's working and doesn't like to be disturbed, but you're an exception," Lucas replied, his smile unwavering.

"Thanks!" Olivia replied, her impatience evident. With the door unlocked, she didn't hesitate, bursting in without a knock.

"Isabella, can you please... Ah! What are you doing!" she exclaimed, hands flying up to cover her eyes.
