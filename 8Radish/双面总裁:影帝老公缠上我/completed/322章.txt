Title: **More Than Meets the Eye**

---

**Chapter 1: Family Ties**

"Wait, what? She won’t donate? You begged her on your knees, and she still refused?" Grace Martin exploded, her voice echoing through the room. She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at White Pines, her husband, who stood by with a solemn face.

"Isn't she your daughter?" Grace continued, her frustration boiling over. "You can't even convince your own daughter to help—what a waste! No wonder she turned out so heartless, with a father like you!"

White Pines took the hit silently, his head bowed, absorbing Grace's wrath without a word. He knew better than to retaliate.

Grace wasn't done. She kept on ranting, her voice rising with each insult. She pounded the bed for emphasis, threatening to withhold her inheritance if he didn't secure a kidney donor soon. Life had been hell since the family business collapsed, especially after an incident with Olivia Stewart that left Grace disfigured. White Pines had made her life miserable ever since, with constant verbal and physical abuse.

But now, with a chance to turn the tables, Grace was determined to make the most of it.

White Pines, ever the opportunist, stayed silent, letting Grace vent her fury. He knew she'd have to pause for breath eventually.

Sure enough, after a particularly vindictive string of insults, Grace's energy waned. She slumped back, panting, her voice hoarse from shouting.

White Pines quickly offered her a glass of water, his face plastered with a sycophantic smile. "Honey, you must be thirsty after all that yelling. Want to keep going after a drink?"

"Keep going? You wish!" Grace snapped, flinging the glass of hot water into his face. "If it weren't for your wandering eyes and that affair with Sophie Allen, we wouldn't be in this mess! And now, that daughter of yours won't even help when I'm dying!"

The hot water scalded White Pines' face, but he just gritted his teeth, the pain mingling with his frustration. "Grace, you're going too far!"

"Too far? If you can't handle it, divorce me already!" Grace shot back, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

Years ago, when her face was first disfigured and White Pines discovered she'd angered Isabella Peterson and Olivia Stewart, he'd constantly threatened divorce. She'd been on her knees, begging him to stay. Luckily, an unexpected inheritance from a distant relative had saved her.

Grace's eyes were filled with bitter irony, but beneath the bravado lay a layer of pain and sadness. White Pines might be a heartless opportunist, but she'd never imagined leaving him. Memories of the past stung, bringing unwanted tears to her eyes. She turned away, trying to hide her vulnerability.

White Pines, sensing he'd pushed too far, softened his tone. "Come on, Grace. We've been through so much together. Let's not dwell on the past. We're partners, right? We should support each other. You took care of me when I was down. Now it's my turn to help you."

Initially, Grace seemed to soften, but as his words continued, her temper flared again. She hurled the empty glass at him, shouting, "You just want my money!"

White Pines dodged the glass, which shattered against the wall, scattering shards across the floor.

"Whoa, whoa, what's going on here?" came a voice from the doorway. Samantha Phillips, a middle-aged doctor in a white coat, strolled in, her eyes taking in the scene.

Samantha was a friend of Grace's and often checked in on her. Seeing Grace's tear-streaked face, she asked, "Can't you two just talk things out like civilized adults?"

Grace sniffed, wiping her eyes and gesturing at White Pines. "Can you believe this guy? He had a kid with another woman, and now he can't even get her to donate a kidney!"

Samantha patted Grace's shoulder sympathetically. "You know, you're not a kid anymore. Crying like this isn't helping. Are you sure that girl is so heartless?"

Grace glared at White Pines, her voice dripping with exasperation. "Absolutely! And to make things worse, my daughter, Molly, isn't a match! If she were, I'd drag her here myself. But Olivia Stewart? She's different—she's got a rich, powerful boyfriend backing her up!"

Samantha frowned thoughtfully. "Usually, a biological child's the best match. But Olivia matched? That's quite a coincidence, don't you think?"

Her offhand remark struck a chord with Grace, who remembered a long-buried suspicion. Years ago, after returning from the countryside, she'd noticed a beloved bracelet missing. Later, she'd seen it on Olivia's wrist, who claimed it was a keepsake from her mother. Could it be that Sophie Allen had swapped the children?

Grace's mind raced, but she dismissed the thought as absurd.

Still, the possibility nagged at her. What if Olivia was her biological daughter? Would she then agree to donate her kidney?

Driven by desperation, Grace urged White Pines, "Get some of Olivia's hair or something. We need a DNA test!"

White Pines was incredulous. "Grace, that's insane! Olivia's clearly Sophie's daughter."

"Just do it!" Grace insisted.

In her desperation for a kidney, Grace was willing to overlook White Pines' past transgressions. All she hoped for now was that Olivia was indeed her daughter, so she could claim the kidney she so desperately needed.

Little did she realize that even if Olivia was her biological daughter, it wouldn't change the past. With all the hurt she'd caused, why would Olivia ever agree to help her?

Reluctantly, White Pines set out to obtain Olivia's hair. After a few days, he managed to snatch a few strands during one of his desperate pleas.

The samples were sent off for testing, and everyone waited anxiously for the results.

But what would they reveal?

**Chapter 2: Revelations Await**

The results were finally in, and both Grace and White Pines were on edge, each lost in their own thoughts about what the revelation might mean for their future. Would it be the miracle Grace hoped for, or just another twist in their tangled family saga?
