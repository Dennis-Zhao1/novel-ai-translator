The day after the press conference, the buzz around Olivia Stewart was all over the place, yet Olivia herself remained silent, much to the frustration of Jasper White.

Initially, Jasper sat in the living room with an air of authority, hoping to assert his parental role when Olivia finally showed up. But as the morning dragged on with no sign of her, his patience wore thin, and he began pacing back and forth.

"Go to the gate and check, make sure Miss Olivia hasn't lost her way," he instructed one of the house staff, clearly anxious.

Both his wife, Grace Martin, and daughter, Mia White, had been ordered to stay home, and their expressions grew sour seeing Jasper's impatience.

Mia muttered under her breath, "All this fuss, what if she doesn't even care?"

Her comment snapped Jasper back to reality. "Butler, prepare a lavish gift! I’ll go personally to pick her up! And Mia, Chloe, bring out your best cosmetics and jewelry for the occasion. No holding back!"

Mia shot up, fuming. "For a mere illegitimate child, you're going too far! Why should I give up my best stuff?"

Grace tugged at Mia's dress, signaling her to calm down. Grace was more experienced in dealing with such matters and knew when to hold her tongue.

Mia sat back down, reluctantly agreeing, "Fine."

Once Jasper left, Mia turned to Grace in a huff. "Mom, do you really want Olivia Stewart in our family? Don't forget, she's the result of an affair, not your daughter!"

Grace gave Mia a sidelong glance. "You think I don't hate her? But look at your dad right now. Can we stop him? Opposing him now will only make us targets. Don't worry, even if Olivia comes back, I have ways to deal with her!"

Mia's eyes gleamed with mischief, "I almost forgot to tell our idiot brother. With a pretty sister around, he can't be slacking off anymore!"

Grace laughed at the cunning in Mia's eyes, poking her forehead. "You little schemer! Won't that make your dad furious?"

The two shared a conspiratorial laugh. Mia's "idiot brother," Oliver Phillips, wasn't actually dumb—just spoiled rotten. At eighteen, he was more interested in partying and chasing girls than anything else. Jasper's ambition to connect with the Peterson Group was all about paving a smoother path for his underachieving son.

Mia and Grace planned to use Oliver's weakness for women to ruin Olivia, a plan as malicious as it was risky.

Meanwhile, Jasper, carrying a bounty of gifts, headed out, instructing the butler to keep an eye out for Olivia's arrival. But even after reaching the upscale complex where she lived, there was no word of Olivia heading to their home.

Jasper was irritated. This daughter was acting high and mighty. Wasn't she just an actress? If not for Isabella Peterson's preference, he wouldn't bother with this at all. But for the sake of getting in with the Peterson Group, he had to treat her like royalty.

The complex had tightened security since Olivia's rise to fame, with guards questioning everyone to keep reporters out. Jasper, a man of status, was unaccustomed to such treatment and was visibly frustrated, his opinion of Olivia dropping even further.

Despite his annoyance, he had to keep calm. Once he arrived at Olivia’s door, the butler knocked, while the bodyguards stood ready with gifts in hand.

No answer.

After several attempts, the door opened a crack, revealing a wary young man. "What do you want?"

The butler, smiling politely, asked, "Is this Olivia Stewart's residence?"

The man, with a striking face, eyed them suspiciously. "What do you need her for?"

The butler gestured to Jasper. "This is Mr. White, Olivia Stewart’s father!"

Expecting a change in attitude, they were surprised when the young man remained indifferent. "Wait here," he said, shutting the door in their faces.

"This… this is outrageous!" Jasper fumed. Coming to see his daughter only to be met with such rudeness!

The butler tried to calm him. "Sir, don't be upset. That young man must not realize who you are. Miss Olivia will surely treat you differently."

Jasper huffed, "Hmph!"

He thought Olivia should be grateful for the opportunity he was providing, but Olivia had no intention of being associated with him. She was perfectly fine with her life and had no desire to reenter the White family.

After a while, the door opened again. "Come in," the young man said, still aloof.

Jasper frowned at him. "Who are you? Why are you staying with my daughter?"

Olivia, coming out in casual homewear, overheard Jasper's harsh tone towards Ethan King. She already had little patience for this man claiming to be her father. Now, she liked him even less.

"He's my friend, Ethan King. This is his place. Where else would I stay?"

Jasper was shocked. "Olivia, aren't you with the Peterson Group's second son? How can you live with another man? What if the Petersons find out? Come with me now!"

Olivia, irritated by Jasper’s presumption, responded coldly, "What does it matter to you?"

"You… I'm your father!"

"My father? Hah!" Olivia scoffed, her sarcasm clear.

Jasper's face turned red and then pale, speechless.

Trying to save face, the butler quickly ushered the gifts forward, bowing with a smile. "Miss Olivia, these are gifts from your father. Please, have a look!"

Olivia, her expression polite but distant, said, "No need. I don't require these things. Take them back. And I'm not Miss Olivia; please just call me Olivia Stewart."

Jasper, frustrated, punched the wall beside him. "Olivia Stewart, what do you mean by this?"

"Hey, watch it! Olivia's pregnant. Scare her, and I'll thrash you!" Ethan stepped in protectively, though his flamboyant demeanor undercut his threat.

"You’re pregnant? Whose child is it?" Jasper asked bluntly, his eyes on her belly.

Olivia wanted to kick him out but held back, her voice icy. "Whoever it is, it's none of your business! Whether you're my biological father or not, I have no intention of acknowledging you. Leave and don't disrupt my life again!"

With that, she turned to leave.

Jasper panicked. He’d only focused on asserting authority, forgetting Olivia hadn't officially acknowledged him yet.

Quickly softening his tone, he followed her. "Olivia, I was just worried about you and spoke harshly. Don't take it to heart!"

Not thrilled about dealing with this opportunistic father, Olivia decided it was best to resolve the issue. She pointed to the couch, "Sit."

"Ah!" Jasper eagerly sat, hopeful. "Olivia, I know I neglected you all these years, but I didn't know about you then! Once you come back to the family, I’ll make it up to you. Look at the wonderful things I've brought!"

The butler dutifully displayed the gifts on the coffee table, explaining each item, hoping Olivia would appreciate them.

But Olivia didn't even glance at them. "I don't need these things."

Feeling snubbed, the butler awkwardly backed off.

Jasper, embarrassed, tried to cover it with a smile. "I know our family can't compete with the Petersons, and Isabella must have given you much better things. You're a famous actress now, and those rich kids must be showering you with gifts…"

"Mr. White!" Olivia's sharp voice cut him off. "I don’t care what you think of actresses, but I've always been aboveboard. If you keep making baseless assumptions, you can leave!"

Jasper’s attempt to control the situation backfired, and he sat there, speechless, as Olivia's cold stare bore into him. He realized that winning Olivia over wouldn't be as easy as he'd assumed, and perhaps, for once, he needed to adjust his approach.
