Olivia Stewart was beginning to find Ethan King more and more inscrutable, her big, bright eyes filled with questions. Ethan tousled her hair affectionately. "No overthinking, Olivia!" he said. "No matter what I've done in the past, I've never meant to harm you. I'll explain everything in time. Just wait for me here. I promise I'll be back!"

His words sounded strangely like a line from a melodramatic movie. As Ethan was taken away by men in black suits, Olivia chased after him to the door, tears pooling in her eyes, alongside her friend Emma Thomas.

Ethan turned around, waved goodbye, and disappeared around the corner of the hallway. Emma pouted, "How can they treat Ethan like this?"

Olivia forced a smile. "Don't worry. They called him 'young master,' so they won't harm him. Whatever the reason they're taking him, at least his life isn't at risk."

In a twist of fate, Olivia found herself wide awake, staring at the ceiling until dawn. When she finally drifted into a fitful sleep, a loud knocking at the door startled her awake.

She sat up in bed, her heart pounding as she called out cautiously, "Who's there?"

"It's me, Lucas Wright," came the reply. Recognizing the voice, Olivia exhaled in relief and opened the door. "You scared me! Why are you here so early?"

Lucas looked at the bright morning sun streaming through the window. "Early?" he echoed with a grin. "I'm here to deliver something for you."

"Deliver something? What?" she asked skeptically.

Lucas handed her a card and a smartphone. "This is your salary for working as a personal trainer, and the phone is for you, so the young master can contact you whenever needed."

Needed? Does Isabella Peterson still need me? Olivia's lips curled into a wry smile. "Lucas, I was only at the manor for a few days, and I didn't even do any fitness training with Isabella. He knows more about fitness than I do. I can't accept this salary. Consider it a free trial."

"Olivia, please don't make it difficult for me. If you don't accept it, I won't have an answer for the young master. Besides, your salary is calculated on an annual basis."

Annual salary? Working 24/7 all year round... Isabella Peterson sure is generous! Olivia shrugged. "I haven't even worked by his side. What's his deal?"

"You're still under contract with the young master," Lucas said earnestly. "It's only right he pays you."

"But it feels like..." Olivia trailed off. A windfall from the sky usually meant either a trap or a pitfall.

"Did Isabella say anything about me going back to work?" she asked.

"Not yet," Lucas replied.

Her eyes dimmed for a moment. It seemed he really held a grudge about that incident. If that's the case, why is he sending money?

Lucas pushed the card and phone towards her again. "Please, Olivia, accept them!"

Olivia smiled brightly. "Lucas, take this back to him. I can't accept it. Sure, I'm short on cash, and I love money, but I have my principles. Tell Isabella that I'm still working at the fitness club. If he wants to pay me, he can use the rate for a tea server."

"Olivia, if I may say, the salary difference between a personal trainer and a tea server is huge! You're still at the fitness club, and the young master hasn't troubled you. Why not..."

"Do the work, get the pay. That's how I sleep at night. And that jerk Isabella set a sky-high penalty fee for breach of contract. As long as I'm still at the club, even as a tea server, I'm not breaching anything, right?"

Seeing her determination, Lucas conceded, "Okay, I'll report back about the salary. But the phone, you have no reason to refuse, right?"

"I don't want it!"

"I heard the young master broke your phone. This is his way of compensating you. Olivia, you're too smart to let yourself be shortchanged."

"You don't know, Lucas. That jerk is such a control freak. This phone can only call him. What's the point of that?"

Lucas chuckled warmly. "Don't worry, Olivia. The phone's been set up for normal use. You can call anywhere, even Antarctica, if you want!"

Really? To chat with penguins? Olivia couldn't help but laugh. Realizing the phone was usable, she decided to accept it, relieved. She really needed it, especially after Sophie Cook had emptied her wallet days ago.

Olivia examined the phone case, feeling a twinge of jealousy over the embedded name. She removed it. "Take this back to your young master. I'll keep the phone."

Lucas finally relaxed, having completed his task. Before leaving, he remembered something. "Olivia, I noticed your apartment door looks broken. It's not safe. Should I call someone to fix it?"

"Yes, thank you! Last night, some men in black broke in and took Ethan away," Olivia explained with a sigh.

Lucas frowned, puzzled. "Really? Sounds like this neighborhood has poor security. Why not move back to the manor?"

Olivia shook her head. She had been kicked out by Isabella. How could she just go back?

"Don't worry, the security here is usually great. Those men were looking specifically for Ethan. They called him 'young master' but insisted on taking him away. That's all I know. Could you help find out about Ethan through Group Peterson?"

Lucas looked a bit conflicted. "Finding someone isn't hard for Group Peterson, but the young master would have to approve it."

"I see. So, if I want information on Ethan, I need to speak to Isabella." Olivia remained calm, though her heart sank.

"Olivia, I'm just explaining the situation. It's not the young master making it hard for you."

"Understood. Lucas, wait here while I pack. I'll go back with you to the manor." Olivia went to gather her things.

"You're willing to come back?" Lucas asked, surprised but pleased.

"Yes, I'm still his personal trainer, right? And the salary difference is too big to ignore. Why fight against money?" Olivia replied pragmatically.

Lucas beamed like a proud grandparent. "I knew you were smart, Olivia. I'm glad you see it that way."

As Olivia packed, Lucas called for repairs. On the way back, Lucas was all smiles, hopeful that bringing Olivia back would please Isabella.

During the ride, Olivia was quiet, contemplating how to charm Isabella into helping her find Ethan. But she knew what Isabella held against her, and she was anxious about the uncertain reception she might face.

When they arrived, Lucas told her, "The young master is at the Mediterranean Castle. He hasn't stayed in the Pink Castle since you left."

He's really upset, she thought, feeling a pang of remorse.

Guided by the staff, Olivia reached Isabella's new residence. The interior was a stunning blend of blue and white, with glass floors revealing shimmering water beneath. Tropical fish swam in tanks, and the whole place exuded a tranquil, oceanic vibe.

Impressed by the beauty, Olivia couldn't help but admire Isabella's dedication to creating such a masterpiece. As she started up the stairs, she was so distracted by the view that she ran straight into something solid.

"Ouch!" she cried, rubbing her nose. She had collided with a wallâ€”or so she thought.

Olivia looked up to find herself face-to-face with none other than Isabella himself, standing a step above, towering over her like a prince over a dwarf. His expression was unreadable, but his presence was unmistakable.

"Good morning," she managed, forcing a smile despite the awkwardness.

Isabella looked down at her with a regal air, his voice cool and commanding. "It's already noon," he said with a hint of amusement.
