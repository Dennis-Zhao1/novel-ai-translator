Olivia Stewart had just left the sprawling headquarters of Titan Studios, tears still fresh on her cheeks. Standing outside, Ethan King immediately noticed her distress and rushed over, concern etched on his face. 

"Olivia, what's wrong?" he asked gently.

"He's a lunatic..." Olivia mumbled, collapsing into Ethan's arms and sobbing like a child. She knew it wasn't right to lean on him this way, but right now, she just needed a shoulder to cry on.

Ethan, flustered and worried, softly patted her back. "Hey, don't worry. Whatever's going on, you've got me."

After a good cry, Olivia pulled back, a bit embarrassed, and wiped her tears. She briefly recounted the whole ordeal to Ethan.

"Ethan, I'm screwed. It's happening all over again! Am I just useless?" she lamented.

Ethan sighed internally, seeing Olivia looking like a mess. Poor thing. She never really got over it, did she? He gently wiped away her tears and said, "Nonsense! You're amazing, Olivia, and you deserve the best. Even if Isabella Peterson was a jerk before, at least he's trying to make amends. Now, let's get you back home to rest. We can't have you stressing out."

Olivia hesitated, her expression awkward. "Ethan, maybe I shouldn't go back with you. It feels unfair, like I'm using you as a backup."

Ethan couldn't help but chuckle. Her honesty was something he appreciated. He liked her straightforwardness.

He gave an exaggerated sigh. "If only I were just a backup! At least that means you'd consider me, right?"

"Ethan, I..."

"Enough of that," Ethan interrupted with a dismissive wave. "You did save my skin that one time, remember? So let me return the favor. Stay with me until Isabella comes back. Besides, if anything happens to you while I'm around, I'm sure he'd have my head."

With nothing left to say, Olivia reluctantly agreed to go back with Ethan to their neighborhood.

As they hurriedly got into the car, neither noticed the scruffy-looking older man lurking in the shadows, eyes fixed on Olivia with a sinister glint. As soon as they drove off, he flagged down a taxi to follow them.

Ethan, a skilled driver, was taking it slow because Olivia was pregnant. The luxury sports car crept along like a snail, much to the frustration of the drivers behind them who kept honking.

Olivia remained lost in thought, unaware of the taxi tailing them, with a pair of eyes full of malice locked on her.

Later that afternoon, when Olivia ran out of her special pregnancy drink, she decided to head to the nearby store to get more. Ethan was passed out from a gaming marathon the previous night, and she didn't want to wake him, so she slipped out quietly.

The neighborhood was peaceful, and after leaving through the gate, it was just a ten-minute walk to the large grocery store. Olivia, masked and head down, hurried along the sidewalk, almost bumping into someone as she turned a corner.

She instinctively protected her belly and mumbled an apology, "Sorry!"

Without looking up, she sidestepped and continued forward.

"Hey, kiddo, now that you're famous and rolling in dough, you don't recognize your old man?"

The raspy, aged voice made Olivia freeze. She looked up in shock at the familiar stranger before her.

"You... you..."

Standing in front of her was none other than James Cook, her long-lost father.

James rubbed his hands together, grinning obsequiously. "Olivia, you're a big star now! Look at you, all radiant and loved by everyone!"

Olivia cringed at his words. Was this how a father should talk to his daughter?

"Olivia!" James edged closer, shamelessly. "Your new movie's a hit, right? Must've made a fortune. I don't need much, just a million or two to tide me over."

Same old storyâ€”always about the money.

Olivia stepped back, disgusted. "I'm not giving you any money!"

James's demeanor shifted instantly, eyebrows raised in anger. "After raising you, what's wrong with asking for a little help?"

He gestured at his shabby clothes, "Look at you and look at me! I wouldn't even know my daughter was such a success if not for seeing your posters everywhere."

"You're rich now and didn't even think to share some of your good fortune with your old man? What kind of daughter are you?"

Olivia laughed bitterly, though there was nothing funny about it. "I would've loved to share if you hadn't disappeared for years. You sold me out for cash, vanished after Mom died, leaving me and Sophie to fend for ourselves. Where were you then?"

James stammered, "I... I... if I hadn't found you a good sponsor, would you be who you are today? That old witch didn't want to pay after her son knocked you up. They even tried to kill me, but I got away!"

"What did you say?"

Olivia's eyes widened. "I was pregnant with Isabella's child, and you tried to extort his mom?"

Caught by Olivia's fierce gaze, James backtracked, "I just wanted some support for the kid! Raising a child costs a fortune, you know!"

"Bull!" Olivia shouted.

"The child was aborted. What support are you talking about?"

"Well, actually, the child..." James faltered, realizing he'd slipped up again, and tried to flee.

But Olivia was quick, catching him. Despite being a man, James's years of indulgence had left him frail, and he stumbled, falling to the ground.

"Tell me, what happened to that child?" Olivia demanded.

Cornered, James finally confessed, "The child wasn't aborted. After birth, someone took it away."

"Took it away? How could you let someone take my child?"

Olivia trembled with rage.

James, regaining some composure, retorted, "You weren't married then! Raising a child alone was disgraceful. Besides, you were severely depressed, barely able to care for yourself, let alone a child."

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes. "Who took the child? Where?"

James's eyes darted, a sly smile spreading. "Olivia, I've camped outside this complex for days, no drink or bite. My memory's fuzzy."

Olivia glared at him, "How much?"

James held up five fingers, "Five million."

Outrageous!

Olivia was furious. "Do you think I'm running a bank?"

Sensing her desperation, James grew bolder. "Think it over, Olivia. You're a famous star now. If I spill about the kid, your reputation's toast. Five million's nothing. One dinner with a wealthy backer and you've got it."

"You..." Olivia clenched her fists, restraining the urge to punch him. "Fine! I'll give you the money, but you have to tell me where the child is."

James immediately grinned, "Knew my daughter was smart!"

Olivia waved him off, disgusted, "I can't get that much money right away. Come back in two days."

James's face lit up, nodding enthusiastically, "Great! Two days it is."

Once James was out of sight, Olivia leaned against the wall, feeling utterly drained. 

How could she have a father like him?

Not wanting to burden Ethan further, Olivia kept the extortion secret. She set up a new account and transferred the five million, even dipping into the funds Isabella had given her.

Two days later, Olivia sent Ethan on an errand to meet James alone. Sure enough, he was waiting for her.

"Hey, sweetheart, right on time. Got the money?" James greeted her with a smirk.

Olivia handed over the card. "Password's six sixes. Now, tell me where the child is."

James inspected the card suspiciously, "Really five million on this? Not tricking me, are you?"

Frustrated, Olivia snapped, "Not everyone's as shameless as you. Check if you don't believe me."

She showed him the balance on her phone to prove it, and James's eyes widened as he counted the zeros, grinning ear to ear. "Great, great!"

"Now, tell me where the child is," Olivia pressed.
