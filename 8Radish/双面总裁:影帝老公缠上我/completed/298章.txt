Title: No More Second Chances

Olivia Stewart cast a mocking glance at Grace Martin, "What, not satisfied that I didn't get disfigured?"

Grace Martin's face turned white as she looked at Olivia's bodyguard's bloodied feet, her eyes filled with a burning hatred. She was like a venomous snake, cold and ready to strike.

Without warning, Grace hurled a bottle of acid toward Olivia's face. "You dared to ruin my daughter, I'll ruin you!"

"Watch out, Miss Stewart!" 

A squad of bodyguards lunged forward, forming a human shield to protect Olivia. 

The acrid smell of burning flesh filled the air, accompanied by an agonizing scream that echoed through the room. Olivia's mind flashed back to when David Wright took the hit for her, leaving a burn mark on his back. Her body trembled at the memory.

She'd always been too soft-hearted towards this mother-daughter duo, but her bodyguards, who were devoted to protecting her, often ended up hurt. This time, she resolved not to give them any more chances.

Mustering all her strength, Olivia steadied herself, opened her eyes, and was stunned by the scene before her. Her bodyguards stood unscathed, while Grace Martin was writhing on the ground, clutching her face, howling in agony.

Concerned, Olivia quickly checked her bodyguards, "Are you all okay?"

"We're fine, Miss Stewart," one of them replied, touched by her worry.

Olivia pointed at Grace on the floor, "And what about her?"

A small voice piped up, "Did I do a good job, Olivia?"

Looking down, Olivia saw the little rascal, Joey, holding a tennis racket with a huge hole burned through it. His new clothes were dotted with acid burns.

Stunned, Olivia examined Joey closely, "Are you hurt? Does it hurt anywhere?"

Joey shook his head with a grin, "When the bad lady threw the grenade, I hit it back! Did I do well?"

Olivia hugged him tightly, "Joey, you're amazing, but do you know how dangerous that was? Next time, remember to get out of the way!"

Joey shook his head resolutely, "I've grown up. I want to protect you too, Olivia!"

"Joey, where have you run off to? I've been looking everywhere for you!" The headmistress came running over, giving Olivia an apologetic look, "He’s such a handful!"

"Not at all," Olivia said, patting Joey's head. "Joey just did a very important thing!"

She handed Joey back to the headmistress, gently tapping his forehead, "Go change clothes with the headmistress, and no more sneaking out, okay? I'll come see you later."

Joey nodded reluctantly, glancing back at Olivia with every step, his cuteness melting her heart.

Once Joey was inside, Olivia turned back to the matter at hand. Grace Martin and her daughter had fainted from the pain.

Olivia averted her eyes. Ever since seeing Isabella Peterson's scarred wrist, she couldn't stomach the sight of blood.

The bodyguards swiftly carried Grace and her daughter out, clearing the scene.

The kitchen lady approached, dropping to her knees before Olivia. "I'm so sorry, Miss Stewart. I had no idea they meant you harm!"

Olivia looked at her, a simple, trembling middle-aged woman. Once, she would have waved her off without hesitation.

But her kindness had cost her too much, with her former sister Sophie Cook and now Grace Martin and her daughter.

"Why did you let them in?" Olivia asked, her voice icy.

The kitchen lady, meeting Olivia's gaze, quickly lowered her eyes in fear. This usually gentle woman could be quite intimidating when her face turned serious, exuding a natural authority without a hint of malice.

Caught in fear, the lady's resolve crumbled as she admitted, "I was greedy. They said they'd never seen you and wanted to meet you, so they gave me this."

From her pocket, she pulled out a shiny necklace, reluctantly offering it to Olivia.

Olivia chuckled, "This kind of necklace is five bucks a piece at a street stall."

"Ah!" The lady dropped the chain in shock, hurriedly picking it up, studying it in disbelief.

"You didn't think about it? They look so down-and-out, how could they afford a real gold chain? And just to see me, they'd bribe you with something valuable? Does that make sense?"

The realization dawned on her as the necklace broke, revealing a dark interior. She'd been duped by those two women!

Recalling Grace and her daughter's screams, the lady's face turned pale, her lips quivering as she looked at Olivia in terror, too scared to plead for mercy.

Olivia gave her a measured look, "Your small greed is a big problem when you're in charge of the kitchen in a children's home. Imagine if someone bribed you to serve substandard food, what would happen to the kids? Today, Grace and her daughter targeted only me, but what if they were out to poison everyone? Could you bear that responsibility?"

The lady's face fell as she bowed her head in defeat.

"You can't stay here anymore. Find another job," Olivia declared, waving her hand tiredly.

A glimmer of hope flashed in the lady's eyes. She had feared she'd meet the same fate as Grace Martin and her daughter but was merely being dismissed. It seemed Olivia, after all, was still a kind-hearted woman.

The kitchen lady left with profuse thanks.

David Wright, standing nearby, asked quietly, "Miss Stewart, is it wise to let her go? Could she cause trouble later?"

Olivia sighed, "I'm a mother now, and I don't want to make too many enemies. She's greedy but not malicious, unlike Grace Martin and her daughter. Let her go."

"But Miss Stewart..." David began, concern in his voice.

Hearing yet another "Miss Stewart," Olivia rubbed her temples. She wasn't even married to Isabella Peterson yet!

But Isabella liked hearing it, and the household staff followed suit, so even the bodyguards called her that. She'd given up correcting them.

Still, she wondered if this meant Isabella would skip the wedding altogether.

Catching herself, Olivia shook her head with a smile, deciding to focus on the task at hand.

Turning to David, she asked, "What did you want to say about Grace Martin and her daughter?"

"They've tried to harm you multiple times. You shouldn't let them off so easily!" David said, kneeling on one knee, "Please forgive my impudence!"

Olivia, amused by his earnestness, chuckled, "You're just looking out for me. How could I be upset? Stand up before you become the butt of jokes!"

David blushed, standing up straight, "They won't laugh because they would do the same. You're our Miss Stewart, and Mr. Peterson said we should respect you more than him!"

Olivia felt warmth spread through her heart, tears brimming at the corners of her eyes. Isabella always knew how to touch her softest spots. How could she keep making him worry?

She toyed with the beads on her bracelet, speaking softly, "Wake Grace and her daughter up, and treat their injuries."

"Miss Stewart!" David raised his voice in disbelief.

Had she not listened to a word he said?

Olivia gave a sly smile, "I said treat their injuries, not give them a makeover. Do you think I'm letting them go? No, you don't understand women. Grace and her daughter are vain and value their looks. For them, living like this is worse than dying."

Realization dawned on David. He glanced at Olivia's profile, her smile mischief incarnate, and shivered. Women could be scarier than men when ruthless!

But that's what Olivia needed—to harden her heart. Otherwise, she couldn't keep up with Isabella, who faced many challenges. If she couldn't protect herself, Isabella would have to worry even more.

David's expression was so transparent that Olivia stood up, addressing everyone, "Don't worry. I'll grow stronger and stand alongside Isabella soon."

The bodyguards straightened, bowing their heads in unison, "We serve Miss Stewart!"

Olivia waved them off, "Go back to your duties. Let me know when Grace and her daughter wake up."

"Yes, Miss Stewart!" The bodyguards' voices rang out with renewed vigor.
