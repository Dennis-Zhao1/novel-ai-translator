Title: "A Sweet Torture"

“Change it again!”

“Old man!”

Olivia Stewart didn't know why she blurted out such a phrase, her tone sharp as if she were scolding someone.

Isabella Peterson held Olivia's chin, torn between squeezing and letting go. Finally, with a fierce determination, she commanded, “Call me by my name or call me your partner, your choice!”

Partner... how embarrassing!

Olivia deliberately put on a stern face. “Isabella Peterson, let go!”

Isabella released her, a hint of reluctance in her eyes. “I won’t let go again, not for a lifetime!”

Olivia scoffed, “You've already let go!”

“But you came back, Olivia. That’s in the past now, no bringing it up again!”

“Isabella, your letting go and my coming back are two different things! You think you can just sweep everything under the rug and not talk about it because you want to?”

Olivia had told herself to be emotionless and obedient when she returned, but she couldn't do it. Even though Isabella saved her today and publicly displayed affection, she couldn't forget the past humiliation! No amount of love could erase that.

Her eyes reddened with frustration, and she turned away silently.

“I...” Isabella looked at Olivia's tearful eyes, the words “I’m sorry” stuck in her throat, unable to come out.

Finally, Isabella gave herself an excuse to ease the tension, “Olivia, you're a public figure now. What's with all this arguing? Let's go!”

Olivia sat in the car, biting her lip, ignoring Isabella.

When she got Sophie Cook’s call initially, she thought of Isabella first. But she didn’t expect to be humiliated by him, and thinking about it made her feel oppressed!

The drive was silent, Olivia staring out the window, neither speaking to the other.

Gradually, Olivia leaned back in the seat, her breathing softening as she drifted into sleep.

Last night with Sophie Cook had been exhausting, and today’s emotional roller coaster wore her out. As soon as she relaxed, she fell into a deep, restful sleep.

Isabella quietly turned on the car’s heater, rolled up the windows, and drew the curtains. Driving the limited-edition sports car at a snail's pace, earning eye-rolls from every passing driver.

"Just because you have a fancy car doesn't mean you can show off in rush hour!"

When Olivia woke up, several hours had passed.

She opened her eyes, and as she sat up, a jacket slipped off her shoulders.

Olivia picked it up, asking casually, “Isabella, what time is it?”

Her lazy, casual tone carried a hint of sleepiness, like a regular conversation between a young couple.

Isabella’s lips curved into a charming smile, and he offered her a warm, golden pastry. “It’s lunchtime.”

As if on cue, Olivia’s stomach growled audibly.

She blushed with embarrassment.

But with food in front of her, Olivia couldn’t resist, taking a bite of the pastry from Isabella’s hand.

Yum, so good!

Another bite, and then another...

Without realizing it, Olivia bit Isabella’s hand.

A jolt of electricity surged through Isabella, his eyes darkening slightly as he swallowed hard.

Olivia jumped in surprise, “Isabella, are you hungry too?”

She bashfully looked at the remaining piece of pastry. “Why don’t you have the rest?”

Isabella’s gaze burned as he watched her lips move. “You eat first, I’ll eat after you’re full.”

Uh...

Olivia felt a mix of mortification and annoyance.

She’d been teased again!

Wasn’t she supposed to be mad at him? How did one nap make her forget everything and even eat the food he offered?

Who could resist such tempting treats? Especially when they’re from that famous hotel with her favorite golden pastries. Ugh!

Olivia swallowed the pastry, turning away with a huff, refusing to eat more.

Anyway, there wasn’t much left, just crumbs. No big loss.

Unexpectedly, Isabella magically produced another one.

Olivia sniffed discreetly.

Shrimp flavor, for crying out loud!

Isabella, you jerk, why didn’t you bring this out earlier?

Behind her came the sound of chewing, Isabella’s voice muffled, “The hotel chef who made these shrimp pastries left. This is the last batch. I ate four while waiting for you to wake.”

Olivia clenched her fists.

There were only five in the box, and he ate four!

Wait! The one he just offered must be the last one!

She whipped around, the shrimp pastry nearly brushing her lips.

Isabella looked at her with a grin, chewing gum loudly.

“Isabella!” Olivia roared, “I thought you were quiet when eating! Where’s your high-class manners?”

Isabella gave Olivia a cool glance. “Learned from you.”

Ugh!

Frustrated, Olivia bit into the pastry, imagining it was Isabella's hand, chewing with gusto.

Isabella watched his hand intently, swallowing hard. He’d held the pastry closer in, so each bite Olivia took brushed against his hand.

It was a sweet, happy torture!

After devouring the pastries, Olivia wasn’t as hungry and felt a bit bashful, sneaking glances at Isabella. As the saying goes, taking someone’s hand makes you reluctant to be upset, and after eating his pastries, she couldn’t stay mad.

Isabella elegantly wiped his hands with a napkin, asking, “I only had them bring some snacks you like, just in case you were too hungry. Should we head for a proper meal now?”

Olivia patted her belly, “I’m actually pretty full.” Of course, if there were more food, she could eat a bit more!

Olivia rolled down the car window and suddenly saw a tall white building outside with “First People’s Hospital” written on it.

“This is... Isabella, are you sick?”

“Don’t jinx it! Why curse your man?” Isabella flicked Olivia lightly on the forehead, a gentle tap.

“Then...”

“I’ll tell you, but don’t get mad.”

“Okay.”

“That fancy-pants...”

“What happened to Ethan King?”

Isabella’s brows shot up, “He’s not dead yet!”

“Uh...” Olivia glanced at her grip on Isabella’s shirt, quickly smoothing it out, “Tell me, quick!”

“He was in a car accident and is currently...”

Olivia had already opened the car door and bolted.

They reached Ethan’s hospital room, where he lay unconscious. Olivia clutched him, calling his name frantically. Isabella, unable to watch, stepped outside, leaning against the wall, waiting patiently.

After ten minutes, Olivia emerged with red eyes, standing quietly before Isabella.

“I told you he’s not in danger, why... Olivia, what’s with that look? I’m telling you, I didn’t do it! Absolutely not!”

“Olivia, if I had done it, I wouldn’t deny it. But I didn’t, so don’t blame me! Even though I wanted to, I didn’t! You can’t hate me!”

Olivia watched Isabella’s defensive, agitated demeanor and suddenly laughed.

His anxious, hopping-about appearance was unexpectedly endearing!

“Isabella, thank you! I’m just surprised you saved him.”

“You think I wanted to? I only did it because I was worried about you...”

Isabella stopped mid-sentence, pressing his lips together.

Hmph, why tell her that!

Olivia suddenly threw herself into Isabella’s arms, wrapping around him, “I’m glad you’ve learned to consider my feelings!”

“Oh, you’re happy because I saved him? Maybe one day when I...”

“Don’t say it!”

Olivia fiercely interrupted, jumping up to cover Isabella’s mouth.

“You won’t! You never will!”

“If that day ever comes, I’ll be with you!”

Olivia declared firmly, without hesitation.

Isabella’s dark eyes sparkled as if filled with tiny diamonds, bright and dazzling.

This little thing always found her way into the softest part of his heart.

Isabella gently held Olivia, “That day, I thought you wanted money to save him, that’s why I...”

Such a miser!

Olivia playfully punched Isabella, murmuring, “Actually, I should have explained it to you. But it was about Sophie’s reputation, so I wanted to keep it secret, even if you misunderstood me.”

Isabella pressed Olivia’s head against his chest, “Silly girl!”

With their misunderstanding finally cleared, Isabella thought: Surely, we can move past this now?

But Olivia only nestled in his arms for a moment before pushing him away, looking up to declare seriously, “Since you saved Ethan and covered for Sophie, I won’t hold your jealousy and irrational actions against you. But understanding doesn’t mean forgiving. Kicking me out, that’s not over!”

Understanding doesn’t equal forgiving, what nonsense?

Isabella frowned, “What will it take for it to be over?”

“Apologize to me!”

“...”

“And every day, you need to repent and make me happy until my inner wounds heal!”

Isabella’s face instantly filled with reluctance.

She called him petty, but wasn’t she the pettiest of them all?

However, he did mess up that day.

A real man should apologize when he’s wrong!

Isabella moved his lips several times, but the words “I’m sorry” just wouldn’t come out.
