Olivia Stewart hesitated for a moment before nodding. "You know what, you're right," she said, standing on her tiptoes and pointing at her lips, "Take a good look, okay?" She prayed silently, hoping Isabella Peterson wouldn't make her look ridiculous.

Isabella's eyes fell on Olivia's lips. They were naturally plump and a soft shade of pink, without any gloss, yet they seemed to shimmer enticingly. Before she knew it, Isabella leaned in and kissed Olivia.

Olivia's eyes widened in surprise, her protest muffled against Isabella's lips. How did a simple inspection turn into this?

Isabella quickly wrapped an arm around Olivia's waist, holding her in place as she deepened the kiss. Under Isabella's gentle yet assertive touch, Olivia soon relaxed, feeling like her legs were turning to jelly. She clung to Isabella for support, her initial resistance melting away.

Olivia blinked up at Isabella, her eyes misty and unfocused. "Stop..." she murmured breathlessly.

That soft plea was like a spark, igniting a wild fire inside Isabella. Her Adam's apple bobbed as she swallowed hard, and the gentle kiss turned more fervent. She lifted Olivia onto the cool marble countertop in one swift motion.

The sudden chill against her back snapped Olivia back to reality, and she pushed against Isabella's solid chest. "Wait, hold on," she gasped.

Realizing Olivia's discomfort, Isabella eased off, her eyes still burning with desire. "Olivia," she murmured, her voice husky, "Please..."

Olivia was flushed, her cheeks a deep crimson. She couldn't meet Isabella's gaze, instead focusing on the sharp line of Isabella's jaw, where beads of sweat were trickling down.

She knew Isabella was holding back, trying to be considerate of her feelings. It was new, seeing him prioritize her comfort over his own desires. Did this mean he cared for her more than he wanted to admit?

As she pondered this, Olivia couldn't help but smile at herself for thinking such things in the heat of the moment.

Isabella nuzzled into Olivia's neck, her voice barely above a whisper, carrying a hint of vulnerability. "Olivia..."

Olivia's heart ached at the sound, and she instinctively wrapped her arms around Isabella. "Isabella, this marble is really cold and uncomfortable."

Isabella snapped back to reality, realizing he'd placed her on a hard marble countertop instead of something soft. No wonder Olivia was resisting so much!

He quickly picked her up, checking if she'd gotten hurt. "Are you okay?"

Olivia buried her face in his chest, too embarrassed to look up. "I'm fine," she mumbled.

Isabella gazed at her, noticing her red ears. "You're so shy," he teased, lightly nibbling on her earlobe. "Let's head back to the room."

Olivia playfully punched his chest. "Aren't you supposed to be making clay sculptures?"

Covered in clay, they were hardly in the mood for anything else. Isabella's desire simmered down as he focused on the task at hand. "Once I'm done with this sculpture, I'll take my time with you," he whispered.

Olivia rolled her eyes, "If you make it ugly, you'll be making clay figures forever."

As Isabella searched for the missing sculpture, Olivia couldn't help but chuckle at his frantic efforts. The thought of losing his handmade gift for her was too funny not to enjoy.

Finally, Isabella spotted the clay under the table, looking as if it had been squashed. "This can't be it," he said, glaring at the lump.

"That's it," Olivia said, trying not to laugh. "I think I crushed it when you set me on the counter."

Isabella's expression darkened as he realized what had happened. "You couldn't have told me earlier?"

Olivia shrugged, "I didn't notice right away!"

Sighing, Isabella grabbed more clay, determined to start over. "I'll make a new one."

Olivia glanced at the clock. It was late, and Isabella had had a long day. "Maybe we can finish this tomorrow?" she suggested gently.

Isabella looked at her, resolute. "No, we'll do it today. We'll do it every day if we have to."
