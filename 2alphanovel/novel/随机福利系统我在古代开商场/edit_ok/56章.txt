### A Complicated Heart

"You finally woke up! Do you have any idea how worried I was? I didn’t even have any first aid kits on me," Clara Smith's eyes were glistening with tears.

"It's okay now, I'm fine," Ethan James raised his hand, trying to gently brush Clara's cheek.

"Whoa there! Don't move; your arm is really banged up," Clara quickly interjected.

"What about that guy?" Ethan inquired.

"He took off. Said you owe him fifty bucks," Clara replied with a chuckle.

Ethan grimaced. This guy really knew how to hold a grudge. Clara had charged him fifty dollars for a consultation once, and he hadn't forgotten.

"But I offered him the money, and he refused to take it. What a character," Clara mused.

"Still, we owe him for getting us out of that mess. You shouldn’t talk about him like that," Ethan insisted.

Clara promptly zipped her lips, nodding in agreement.

"You're right; we should be thankful. If it weren't for him, we’d be in a much tougher spot."

Ethan looked puzzled for a moment at her words.

"That day? How long was I out?"

"Almost four days. The doctor said you were exhausted and then got injured, which caused you to faint."

"Well, I guess I finally caught up on my sleep," Ethan joked, trying to lighten the mood.

"Boss, you're finally awake! Let me grab you some chicken soup," said Summer, with a cheerful tone.

Thanks to Ethan's help, they had been brought to Springville County, where a doctor attended to their injuries. Summer, who had the least severe injuries, borrowed a small stove from the inn to simmer chicken soup since Ethan hadn’t woken up by the previous day.

Seeing Summer heading out again, Ethan handed Clara a few bottles of ointment from his backpack.

Ethan then applied some ointment to Clara's injured areas and took a swig from the bottle.

"Later, pass some of this to Summer and Brother Sam so they can take care of themselves."

Clara’s injury was on her back, so Ethan had her loosen her shirt to apply the ointment.

When Summer and Autumn received the ointment, they were puzzled.

Since their boss had such good supplies, why hadn’t Clara brought it out for them earlier?

But they kept their thoughts to themselves, swallowing their confusion.

Ethan didn’t ask Clara to explain either; they had acquired the supplies, and discretion was wise.

After spending another day resting, Ethan decided it was time to explore Springville County and check out the local scene to recruit some talent.

After asking the innkeeper for directions to the market, he set off with Clara and the others.

On their way, they passed a bridge where they found a man who had apparently tried to jump into the river, but he had already been rescued.

"Just let me go! My life is pointless. I’ve struggled for years from a poor family only to end up failing the scholar's exam, wearing my parents out," the man lamented, feeling even more hopeless now that he was rescued.

Ethan, hearing that he was a scholar, thought about his plan to recruit talented individuals and decided to approach him.

He soon learned that this man was a student who had intended to take the scholar’s exam, but due to a conflict with a wealthy family, he was prevented from leaving his home and ended up missing the exam.

He lamented that he had drained all his family's savings for his studies, and now, with his parents having passed away from exhaustion, he felt utterly useless and wanted to take his own life.

"Giving up now would be the most ungrateful act towards your parents," Ethan said firmly.

"But all the money has been spent on my education. My path to becoming a scholar has been blocked. For me, dying is a way to avoid bringing disgrace to my parents," he replied despairingly.

"There are many paths to success; you can find other ways to make a living."

"Other ways? I can't farm; I’m not strong enough to carry anything. Besides, my family doesn’t even own any land."

Hearing this, Ethan didn’t want to continue the conversation. This wasn’t the kind of person he wanted to recruit.

But Clara was fired up by the man’s words and wanted to confront him.

"You can work for others! If you earn money in the future, living well is another way to repay your parents," she insisted.

"With your current attitude of despair, your parents in the afterlife would be restless."

Clara’s words grew more intense, and she couldn't help but give him a piece of her mind.

Ethan gently pulled her back, not wanting Clara to waste any more energy on him.

"That’s enough. If you still want to give up, that’s your choice."

Seeing Ethan about to leave, the man quickly grabbed his pant leg.

"You’re right, I can’t do this! I’m being selfish. Would you consider taking me in? I, Henry Quinn, will definitely be loyal to you in the future."

Ethan pushed him away.

"I’m a businessperson; how can you transition from scholar to merchant? We’re not high society."

Henry was taken aback. He just wanted someone to rely on, but he didn’t want to become a merchant; that was not his vision.

"Since you’ve persuaded me, you should help me continue living," Henry pleaded.

"You seem well-off; can you spare some cash? I’ll ask Mr. Jones for forgiveness and continue my studies. Once I succeed, I will repay you," he begged.

Ethan became increasingly annoyed by his persistence. Before he could finish his sentence, he nudged him back towards the water.

After a while, Henry’s cries for help grew softer and softer, and only then did Ethan instruct Autumn to pull him back onto the bridge.

The group then ignored Henry and continued on their way.

"I didn’t expect to run into such a character," Ethan remarked, shaking his head. Next time, he truly wouldn’t waste his breath on just anyone.

Upon arriving at the market, they found several martial artists, but Ethan only recruited three from among them.

Two men and one woman; one of the men was older, while the other man and woman were only slightly older than Ethan. They were a brother-sister pair.

Ethan brought them back to the inn, had Summer buy them some new clothes, and let them freshen up.

"Boss," one of the new recruits greeted.

Ethan looked at the three of them, now clean and refreshed, with satisfaction.

"Please give us names," they requested.

"The older man will be called Sam Carter. The siblings will be named Cedar and Juniper."

"Uncle Sam and Cedar will follow Brother Sam, while Juniper will stay with me."

Before this, Ethan had asked Clara about Juniper, who had been hesitant to take her in because she was quiet and didn’t know how to interact with her.

Once everything was settled, Ethan realized they needed more transportation, as one cart wouldn’t be enough. So, he took Summer and Juniper to the market to buy a sturdy horse.

Seeing that the horse had a golden coat, he named it Sunny.

With Juniper and Cedar driving the carts, Ethan and the others continued their journey the next day.

Although Summer and the others were healing, riding still caused them some discomfort.

Now, Ethan and Clara, along with Summer and Autumn, shared one cart driven by Juniper, while Brother Sam and Uncle Sam shared another cart driven by Cedar.

The reasoning behind having Uncle Sam and Cedar follow Sam was because, in Ethan and Clara’s hearts, Sam was not just a helper but their friend or perhaps an older brother.
