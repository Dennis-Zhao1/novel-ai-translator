**Buying Land at the End of the Alley**

That evening, Clara Joy sat down at her kitchen table, flipping open a small notebook to record the funds she had given to her friend, Summer Ling, earlier that day. Both Summer and another friend, Susan Young, had each chipped in five thousand dollars, so Clara decided to match them, bringing their initial investment to a total of fifteen thousand dollars. Once they started turning a profit, they planned to split it evenly.

Clara had been thinking about how to support Susan, who had gone off to explore some business opportunities. She was also keen to see how Summer would use her share for her culinary experiments, which Clara had always found innovative.

The next morning, Clara, joined by her cousin, Steve, set out to find a real estate agent who could help them purchase a suitable plot of land to build a marketplace. After asking around and getting advice from several locals, Clara learned there were two main real estate agencies in the area.

One was the Smith Realty, which primarily dealt with the rental of commercial properties. The other was the Johnson Realty, specializing in buying and selling land and property rights.

In the county, most of the land was owned by wealthy families, and while some of it was available through these agencies, it was quite rare. Typically, the transactions involved houses and shops.

Clara and Steve arrived at Johnson Realty, and as soon as they walked in, a clerk approached them eagerly. “Hello! Are you looking to buy land or rent a shop today?” he asked with a friendly smile.

“I’m interested in buying a plot of land to develop,” Clara replied with confidence.

“Great! You’ll want to speak with Mr. White, our top agent. Let me get him for you,” the clerk said, nodding before disappearing into the back.

After a short wait, Mr. White appeared. Clara noticed his tall frame and a long scar that ran across his cheek, which contrasted with his otherwise jovial demeanor.

“So, you’re looking to buy land? I’ve got a few options. Why don’t you tell me how much land you’re interested in, and I can help narrow it down for you?” Mr. White suggested, gesturing for Clara to sit while he poured them some coffee.

“I’m looking for a larger plot, around two hundred acres,” she stated firmly.

Mr. White’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Are you sure you mean two hundred acres?”

“Absolutely,” Clara affirmed.

“Well, for something that size, you’ll have to look towards the outskirts. Nothing like that is available in the central area,” he explained, flipping through his records.

“I’d prefer something closer,” Clara insisted.

“Let’s see… we have two options,” Mr. White replied, tracing his finger along the listings. “One is just outside the southern alley, still within the county, and the other is farther out, but it’s farmland. If you choose that one, we’ll have to price it as premium farmland.”

“What’s the asking price for the plot near the southern alley?” Clara asked, narrowing her eyes in thought.

Mr. White studied her carefully before responding. “It’s six thousand dollars per acre, but I can offer you a bit more in terms of width per acre.”

“I’ve heard that area is mostly home to lower-income families. That plot has been neglected for years, the grass is probably taller than most people now. Even if we open a shop, there’s no guarantee we’ll make a profit. Besides, I doubt anyone else would want such a large piece. Are you sure you don’t want to reconsider the price?”

Mr. White’s eyes flashed with concern. “This is the lowest price we can offer. If you ask around, you’ll find we’re the only agency that deals in land sales, especially such large plots. It’s a rare opportunity.”

Clara sensed the underlying pressure in Mr. White’s words—without their help, she wouldn’t find other options.

“If you’re not serious about selling, we can end this conversation here,” she said, standing up to leave.

“Wait, please sit back down. Let’s talk this over. No need to rush,” Mr. White urged, clearly flustered.

“What’s there to talk about? I’m not going to be taken advantage of,” Clara retorted, her voice tinged with irritation.

Seeing her determination, Mr. White quickly recalibrated. “How about this—five thousand per acre? That’s still a total discount of thirty thousand on the two hundred acres.”

Clara shook her head, turning to leave, ignoring his calls to come back. Did he think she was a fool? Five thousand for a piece of neglected land? She knew that if someone cleared it, it could become quite valuable. Back in her hometown, a similar piece of overgrown land had been sold for just nine thousand for over three acres by the old village chief.

“Miss! Are you looking to buy land?” A young man suddenly chased after her.

Clara was not in the mood to deal with anyone from Johnson Realty anymore. She kept her head down, pulling Steve along, determined to leave.

However, the young man persisted, following closely behind, making Steve bark out a few annoyed remarks. It was only when Clara noticed the curious stares from passersby that she finally stopped.

After calming Steve with a reassuring pat on the shoulder, she turned to the young man. “If you want to sell to me, what’s the price?”

“I can offer you three thousand per acre. That’s the lowest I can go,” he replied earnestly.

Clara remained skeptical. “Aren’t you all from the same agency? How can you offer it for so much less?”

“Yes, we work for the same agency, but Mr. White might have miscalculated the price. I overheard him quoting you high, so I came out to catch you before you left,” the young man explained.

Clara scoffed at his reasoning. Still, the opportunity was too good to pass up, and she knew that if she didn’t seize this chance, she might miss out on a great deal.

“Fine, I’ll take it,” Clara decided firmly.

“Then please follow me back to the office. I’ll draft the contract, and once you pay, we can finalize the paperwork at the county office,” he instructed, leading her back.

As they re-entered the office, Clara spotted Mr. White still looking smug. She shot him a glance before following the young man, who introduced himself as Alex.

“What’s your angle, Alex?” Clara asked suspiciously.

“I’m just trying to facilitate the sale of land that Mr. White isn’t willing to let go of,” Alex replied casually.

After drafting the contract, they went to the manager to finalize the signatures. Clara handed over the money, and Alex promptly went to the county office to process the deed.

About half an hour later, Alex returned with the completed land deed, which Clara quickly tucked into her bag.

“If you ever need anything else, feel free to look for me,” he offered, his tone friendly.

Clara felt a twinge of concern that this deal might get Alex in trouble with his agency, but she would deal with that if it happened. For now, she had secured the land she needed.
