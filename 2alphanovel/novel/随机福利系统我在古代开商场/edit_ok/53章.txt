### Highway Encounter

As dusk settled over the landscape, Clara Joy made her way home, the comforting glow of porch lights guiding her path. Before reaching her door, she noticed her sisters, Claire and Autumn, waiting with eager anticipation.

“Finally back! Next time, Autumn tags along, okay?” Claire teased, her voice laced with mock sternness.

Clara Joy dismounted her bicycle, flashing a playful grin. “I know, I know. Made it back in one piece, didn’t I? Don’t look so serious, Claire,” she replied with a wink.

“Seriously though, you’ve got travel plans tomorrow, and here you are gallivanting around,” Claire chided, though her eyes sparkled with amusement.

“There’s just so much to prepare,” Clara Joy explained, shrugging.

Early the next morning, the sisters gathered their essentials, ready to hit the road.

“Hey, just in time!” Ethan called out, pulling up in his truck.

“Perfect! I’ve got something for you,” Clara Joy said, handing him an envelope stuffed with cash. “Could you check in on the shop downtown? I asked Lucy to expand it, and she might need extra funds. Also, keep an eye on the new mall construction. If Old Tom needs more money, help him out, would you?”

“Consider it done,” Ethan replied, accepting his task with a nod.

“Thanks, Ethan. I know you and Lana have a lot on your plate,” Clara Joy said, feeling a pang of guilt.

“You just take care. I’ll be here waiting for your return,” Ethan said, his usual humor replaced with sincerity.

With that, the sisters climbed into the car, with Sandy at the wheel. Curiously, Sandy had heard that it was better for them not to be too close, so she opted for a separate seat this time.

After passing through a couple of towns, they noticed the sun was still high and decided to push onward.

“Clara Joy, the road ahead is narrow, with dense woods on both sides,” Autumn said, peeking out the window.

“Stay sharp; this area’s known for troublemakers,” Clara Joy responded, nibbling on some peanuts.

Suddenly, their path was blocked by a group of men.

“This road’s ours, these trees are ours. Pay up if you want to pass,” a gruff voice demanded.

Clara Joy and the others got out, finding themselves surrounded by a gang.

“Uh-oh, looks like we’ve got ourselves some company,” one guy jeered, eyeing the sisters.

“How much are you asking?” Clara Joy asked, keeping her tone light.

“Five hundred bucks,” the apparent leader replied.

“You’re kidding, right? Five hundred?” Claire scoffed, her cheeks flushing with indignation.

“If you don’t pay, maybe you’d like to meet our boss up close and personal,” the leader sneered, his voice dripping with malice.

His gang laughed, adding to the menace in the air.

Clara Joy’s expression hardened. She had hoped to negotiate, but their intentions were clear.

“What if we refuse?” she challenged.

The leader smirked, signaling his crew. “Then we’ll just have to show you how persuasive we can be.”

Before he could make good on his threat, Sandy launched a kick that sent him sprawling.

As he scrambled up, rage in his eyes, he barked, “Well, looks like you’re asking for it.”

Clara Joy and her sisters spread out, their training evident as they defended themselves. Though the gang was somewhat organized, they were no match for the sisters’ skills. In fifteen minutes, they had subdued the robbers.

Still unsatisfied, Clara Joy approached the leader, giving him a sharp slap. “Next time, watch your mouth.”

With the gang incapacitated, the sisters climbed back into their car and continued their journey without looking back.

Upon reaching Greenfield, they found a cozy inn where they could rest before exploring the town.

However, as they reached the inn's entrance, their path was blocked once again.

“Are you the ones who roughed up our guys?” a scar-faced man demanded.

“Yep, that’d be us,” Clara Joy replied, unfazed.

The inn’s patrons cowered as the confrontation loomed.

“Ladies with fire, I like that,” the scar-faced man taunted.

“Let’s take this outside,” Clara Joy suggested, not wanting to cause a scene.

“Sounds interesting,” the man said, following her out.

Before he could strike, Clara Joy engaged him. The fight was tough, but Clara Joy’s skill eventually won out.

With her sister covering her back, Clara Joy finally bested the man.

“Now, be smart and leave,” Clara ordered.

Helped by his remaining crew, the man retreated, glaring at the sisters.

“You’ve crossed the line with the wrong folks,” he warned as he left.

Once the men had gone, the innkeeper approached, his face lined with worry.

“Are you scared of them?” Clara Joy asked.

“They’re ruthless and don’t care who they hurt. If I shelter you now, my inn will be finished,” he explained, fear in his voice.

Clara Joy nodded, understanding the delicate situation. She and her sisters gathered their things, ready to find somewhere else to stay.

But word spread fast, and no inn or restaurant would welcome them. The townspeople's fear of the gang left the sisters with nowhere to turn.

At that moment, their spirits hit a new low.

“Ding! Reward: One invisibility pill,” a voice intoned, breaking the tension.
