**You Have Some Nerve**

In the afternoon, after finishing a session at the local community center gym, Clara Joy and her friends were surprised by the sudden appearance of Ethan Young.

“Hey, Clara, my grandfather wants to invite you all over for lunch tomorrow,” he announced with a casual grin.

“Really?” Clara asked, raising an eyebrow with curiosity.

“Yeah! About the last time you talked to my sister, it was really my brother-in-law's fault. She's been through a lot because of it, but my grandfather has decided to help her seek justice. So, he wants to thank you by inviting your family over for a meal.”

Understanding the old man's intentions, Clara readily agreed.

The next day, after Ethan helped Clara close up their booth at the local farmers market, he was about to invite their friend, Samantha, to join them. However, Samantha and her friends felt they hadn’t contributed enough and were hesitant to go.

Clara and Ethan tried to persuade them, but ultimately gave up.

During lunch at the Young household, Clara maintained her warm demeanor, engaging the elderly gentleman in conversation and making him chuckle now and then. However, once they exited the Young residence, Clara turned to Ethan with a mischievous glint in her eyes.

“My dear protege, it’s been a while since you’ve shown your appreciation to your mentor,” she teased.

Ethan looked at her, puzzled and a bit uneasy. “Clara, just spill it. You're making me nervous.”

“Take me out for some snacks.”

“Wasn't the food there enough? Didn't you enjoy the meal?” he asked, a playful smirk forming.

Suddenly feeling a bit bashful, Clara fidgeted slightly and replied, “It was great, but I wanted to make a good impression in front of Grandfather Young, you know? Besides, you know I love to eat.”

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head. “So, you're just using me as your excuse to snack more?”

“It’s not about using you; it’s about you showing your gratitude! I’m just worried you’ve been feeling guilty,” Clara defended with a firm yet playful tone.

“Clara, you sure have some nerve,” Ethan retorted with a laugh.

Clara didn’t take offense at his comment; instead, she beamed with pride, which only left Ethan even more amused.

Navigating through the bustling crowd, Clara led Ethan to a variety of food trucks, only stopping when Ethan’s hands were full with snacks. They then found a cozy café to settle in.

As Clara sipped her coffee, savored her snacks, and listened to a live reading, her view was suddenly blocked.

Before she could say a word, the group blocking her was already speaking up.

“Hey, isn’t that Ethan Young? I heard you’re planning to go into business now.”

The leading man sneered at Ethan, dripping with sarcasm. “And I also heard your grandfather has made you an apprentice to a farmer. What’s it like trailing behind a woman every day?”

Laughter erupted from his group, echoing through the café.

Ethan felt his temper flare at the taunts. He stood up, ready to confront the man. “What does my family business have to do with you, Zack Carter?”

“Isn’t it said that academics and farmers are opposite ends? Young Master Ethan, are you planning to make your family die of shame by taking the lowly path?” Zack mocked.

He had always looked down on Ethan, yet somehow, Ethan thrived at home while Zack himself worked hard just to earn a bit of recognition from his own family.

Clara frowned at Zack’s words. She understood that in some circles, merchants and farmers were undervalued, but his blatant disregard was downright offensive.

Rising from her seat, Clara grabbed Ethan’s arm just as he was about to retaliate.

“Zack, your disdain for farmers and merchants is quite unbecoming for someone educated. If all scholars were like you, I’d have to question my respect for them.”

“Disdaining farmers? Tell me, who hasn’t had ancestors who farmed? People live on food, and if you look down on farmers, you shouldn’t be eating the grain they grow.”

“Disdaining merchants? Hmph.” Clara laughed lightly before continuing. “Can any of you honestly say you have no merchants in your family? Do you think money just appears because you study? Don’t you need to buy food and shelter from merchants?”

Her assertive voice resonated throughout the café, striking every listener like a bell tolling.

“What’s lowly? In my eyes, those who only know how to read but fail to respect others are the ones wasting their education. Clearly, they’ve stuffed their knowledge into a dog’s belly.”

Ethan looked at Clara, glowing with confidence, and felt genuine admiration for her. If the moment were right, he would have loved to cheer for her.

“Exactly! If I remember correctly, Zack, isn’t your uncle in the business world? Are you not using the money he earned? It’s no wonder you look down on him; it must be why your family doesn’t appreciate your academic achievements and has sent you back home to keep your ancestors company.”

The mention of Zack’s family situation struck a nerve. He couldn’t tolerate anyone bringing up the fact that he was unloved by his family.

He clenched his fist and swung it at Ethan, but Clara caught his punch.

“Zack, as a scholar, you shouldn’t act so rudely.”

Caught off guard by Clara’s strength, Zack found himself in a predicament, unable to move forward or backward.

“I admit I was a bit too harsh with my words. I hope Zack won’t take offense. As for your disrespect towards your uncle, I have an idea that might help you mend that relationship.”

Zack eyed Clara with skepticism, suspecting her suggestion wouldn’t be anything beneficial. But he knew that if word of his words reached his uncle, it would only worsen his standing in the family.

“What idea?”

Clara released Zack’s hand, calling over a waiter to refill their cups. After inviting Zack to sit down, she poured him a cup of tea.

Ethan watched, puzzled by Clara’s unexpected shift in demeanor. Just moments ago, his mentor had been furious; now, she was welcoming Zack to sit.

He tugged at Clara’s sleeve, but she simply gave him an assuring smile.

“Zack, please have some tea. I apologize for my earlier remarks.”

Seeing her backtrack, Zack straightened up, returning to his proud demeanor.

“Since your words have been spoken, they can’t be taken back. However, if you can do something nice for your family, it might make up for it.”

“What do you have in mind?”

“Your family has both officials and merchants; I’m sure you need to maintain connections, but I think the gift that might bring you the most trouble is what you really need to consider.”

Zack nodded along; he remembered how his uncle had struggled to find an appropriate gift for his superior last New Year.

Gold and silver were too direct, but everything else seemed too trivial.

“I happen to have some rare, aged ginseng. If Zack is interested, I could part with it as a gesture of goodwill.”

Aged ginseng was indeed a rare commodity. If he brought it home, it would surely bolster his standing. Plus, he wasn’t worried about being cheated; he could easily verify its authenticity at a pharmacy.

“Since the lady is so generous, I should also apologize for my earlier behavior. How much of that ginseng do you have? I’ll buy it all.”
