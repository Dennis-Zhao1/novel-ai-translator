**Hot Pot Base**

On the day of the Fall Harvest Festival, Clara Joy and her family decided to head to town early to manage the anticipated rush. By the time they arrived, a crowd had already gathered around their stall, eagerly awaiting their arrival.

As soon as Clara Joy and the others showed up, the crowd surged forward, and before noon, they had sold out all the pies they brought.

Clara Joy realized there was still some time before lunch. Since they planned to visit the Smiths’ anyway, she figured it was best to head over early and return sooner. She suggested that Ethan take his sisters, Lily and Rachel, to explore the town and meet her later at the Main Street Diner.

Meanwhile, Clara Joy had arranged for her brother, Jake, to return home after dropping them off in the morning.

“Welcome!” Clara Joy was greeted warmly by Mr. Smith, the family’s long-time butler, as she arrived at the Smith residence.

With a friendly smile, she returned the greeting.

“Mr. Smith and his grandson are in the garden having a chat!” the butler informed her, leading Clara Joy inside and calling over a young maid to notify them of her arrival.

“Grandpa, I really don’t want to pursue a career in law. Why do Mom and Dad keep pushing me to focus on my studies?” Young Jack Smith said with a slight pout.

“What do you want to do then?” Mr. Smith asked, his voice calm and understanding.

“Well, anything but law,” Jack replied, a hint of defiance in his tone.

“You think I don’t know you? You want to start a business, don’t you?” Mr. Smith said with a knowing smile.

“Mr. Smith, young Jack, Miss Clara Joy is here!” the maid announced.

“You’re here! Come, have a seat!” Jack looked up at Clara Joy, his face lighting up.

“It’s the Fall Harvest Festival today, and I must ask for your help with my health issues again,” Mr. Smith said warmly.

Clara Joy accepted the coffee Jack handed her.

“It’s no trouble at all. I should thank you, Mr. Smith, for helping spread the word yesterday; we sold out so quickly today.”

“It’s because you’re clever. Even without me, you would have found a way to sell those pies,” Mr. Smith asserted confidently.

“Don’t you want to go into business? Can you think of a way to market your goods like Clara Joy does?” Mr. Smith turned to Jack, a hint of teasing in his voice.

After hearing about Clara Joy’s method of selling pies last night, Jack was intrigued.

“I… I just don’t want to study anymore,” Jack stammered, caught off guard by the question.

Clara Joy, sensing the awkwardness, quickly stood up.

“I’ll start with the therapy for Mr. Smith now.”

With practiced ease, she performed acupuncture on Mr. Smith, who no longer kept a doctor on standby, as he held Clara Joy’s skills in high regard.

During the session, Clara Joy wrote out a prescription for Mr. Smith and handed it to the butler, then settled back down to chat with Jack in the courtyard.

“How do you come up with so many ideas for selling things? First, it was the caramel apples, now the pies,” Jack remarked.

Clara Joy paused, momentarily lost for words. Many of her ideas were borrowed from business strategies she remembered from her past experiences.

“Selling caramel apples tapped into the customers' curiosity. As for the pies, I initially planned to attract people with the talents of local musicians and offer samples. Those who tried them would surely want to buy, but it turned out to be the celebrity effect,” she explained.

“How can you be so sure people will buy after tasting?” Jack asked, genuinely curious.

“The food from my family is delicious. Who could resist once they've had a taste?”

His response left Jack momentarily speechless. The pies from Clara Joy's family were indeed the best he’d ever tasted. Even he, who generally disliked sweets, found himself wanting more.

Clara Joy’s words sparked a thought in Jack’s mind.

He genuinely wanted to go into business, but his father always emphasized the importance of a traditional career path. As a result, he had rarely interacted with business-minded individuals and realized that even selling goods required clever strategies.

After a while, Clara Joy removed the needles from Mr. Smith.

“Mr. Smith is all set now! I’ve prescribed some medicine to help maintain the effects,” Clara Joy said cheerfully.

“Thank you! I’m really grateful to have you here,” Mr. Smith replied warmly.

After leaving the Smith residence, Clara Joy went to the Main Street Diner to meet up with her family.

Once they were all together inside the diner, they ordered several dishes to enjoy, relishing the time spent together.

In the following days, Clara Joy and her family took the opportunity to relax. They initially thought that after such a busy period, they would feel exhausted, but surprisingly, none of them felt tired at all.

Clara Joy figured it had something to do with the energy they had been channeling from their surroundings.

By the fifth day, Clara Joy still hadn’t thought of what to do next, let alone her siblings, who naturally had fewer ideas.

Clara Joy kept tugging at her hair in frustration, feeling as if her mind was muddled; she couldn’t seem to come up with anything.

“Oh no, it’s getting colder! I need to gather some firewood from the woods,” Rachel said as she entered, carrying a load of firewood alongside Ethan and Lily.

“Still pondering? Don’t overthink it; just take your time,” Lily advised.

“No way! We’re going to be the most successful family in the region!” Clara Joy firmly rejected the notion of slacking off.

“Ah, right, right! I can’t let myself relax like this. I have to succeed!” Lily exclaimed, slapping her forehead.

“Let’s brainstorm together and think of everything we can from our past experiences to see which ideas we can implement now,” Ethan suggested softly after Rachel headed to the kitchen.

“This morning, I counted the money, and we have a total of over one hundred thirty-five dollars. I’m not sure if that’s enough to build a new house.”

“That should be enough for a basic one, right?” Lily said uncertainly.

*Ding! Reward: One thousand pounds of hot pot base, recipe included.*

“Would you like to transfer it directly to your storage?”

“Transfer.”

Clara Joy suddenly slapped her thigh, startling the others beside her.

“It’s getting cold! How did I not think of hot pot?” she exclaimed.

“Where did that come from?” Ethan asked, surprised.

“I just got a reward of one thousand pounds of hot pot base, and it comes with a recipe!” Clara Joy grinned.

“Even with our current money, it might not be enough to open a hot pot restaurant,” Ethan said, furrowing his brow.

With the hot pot base in mind, Clara Joy quickly began brainstorming other foods they could make that would be suitable for the season.

“How about we sell skewers? We can buy a few grills and cook them in town. The aroma will definitely attract a lot of people. Plus, hot pot skewers have a spicy and flavorful taste; it’s perfect for the colder weather,” Clara Joy excitedly shared her idea.

“Sounds good! I’m craving it already,” Lily said, licking her lips.

“Great, then we can ask Uncle Joe to chop some wood for us to make skewers. When customers buy them, we can serve them in small baskets,” Ethan suggested.

“But once we run out of that one thousand pounds of hot pot base, we’ll need to make our own.”

“With the recipe, I can handle that. While beef tallow is hard to come by, I can use vegetable oil instead, so it won’t be too greasy in the winter,” Lily replied.

“Perfect! Since we have some time, you can start making it in a few days. Our storage can keep it fresh, so it won’t spoil,” Clara Joy assured her.

Lily nodded in agreement.

In the end, they decided to buy three large clay pots and customize three big stoves to create three different flavors.
