**Clearing the Thieves' Den**

Clara Joy's heart pounded with fury as she witnessed the scene unfold before her. The girl being attacked was none other than Laney Smith, a regular at her family's shop.

Without a moment's hesitation, Clara leaped down, her whip cracking like thunder as it took out two of the assailants. Seizing the opportunity, she quickly adjusted Laney's disheveled clothing. As the remaining two men lunged at her, Clara deftly dodged and countered with a swift kick, sending one sprawling.

"Water's getting away, water's getting away!" A commotion outside confirmed that Clara's sister, Ethan Jade, was creating a diversion.

With precise efficiency, Clara knocked out the last two men and grabbed Laney by the arm. "Let's get out of here," she urged, leading her towards a nearby window.

With Laney in tow, Clara couldn't move as fast as she wanted. 

"I'll hide somewhere; you go on ahead," Laney insisted, glancing nervously at their surroundings.

Clara hesitated, then pulled Laney up into the branches of a sturdy tree. "Stay quiet here. I'll be back with help," she promised, urgency in her voice.

Just as Clara was about to leap down, Laney gripped the hem of her shirt. "When you reach the sheriff's office, tell them I'm here too. My name is Laney Smith."

Clara barely had time to nod before taking off.

The area was a forest not far from the county town. Clara used her agility to reach the city outskirts and hurried inward. She rushed past a carriage, not noticing the figure inside watching her.

"Boss, that's the girl who helped you last time," murmured one of the men inside.

The boss remained indifferent, barely acknowledging the comment with a grunt.

Upon reaching the sheriff's office, Clara was at a loss for how to get someone's attention. Spotting a bell nearby, she rang it vigorously.

The loud, clear sound drew the attention of passersby, who stopped to watch. But Clara grew impatient as no officials appeared.

Unbeknownst to her, the sheriff had dispatched all his men to search for missing girls and was himself preoccupied, ignoring the bell's call.

Furrowing her brow, Clara realized she couldn’t afford to wait. She barged through the front door and found two people inside—one pacing anxiously, the other trying to calm him.

"What's going on?" Clara demanded, dropping to one knee.

“Ma’am, there’s a group of criminals in the woods outside town. They’ve captured several girls. We need to send help immediately,” she implored, urgency in her voice.

The sheriff jumped to his feet. "Are you telling the truth?"

"Absolutely! I escaped with my sisters' help," Clara stated, noticing his hesitation.

"There's a girl named Laney Smith; she made me promise to tell you she’s been captured too."

"Laney?" The sheriff's face darkened with worry. "Gather everyone. Let's follow this girl and bring them back."

"Yes, sir!" they replied, and as they prepared, the sheriff appeared even more anxious than Clara.

"What about Laney? Is she okay?" he asked.

"She's fine," Clara reassured him, choosing not to mention the attempted assault. A woman's reputation was important.

After a tense wait, Clara watched as the officials returned, escorting the rescued girls. The sheriff looked slightly embarrassed as he turned to Clara. "We didn't know where Laney was taken at first, so I sent everyone out to search."

Clara nodded, realizing the sheriff cared deeply for Laney, indicating a close relationship.

With several teams of deputies, Clara hurried back to the scene, while the sheriff trailed behind. Upon arrival, Clara was focused solely on finding her sisters.

Bursting into the holding area, she felt panic rise when she saw no sign of them. Heart racing, she asked the other girls, who said that after lighting a signal fire, her sisters hadn't returned. Clara felt a chill run down her spine.

She searched every room frantically, finding only emptiness. As the officials rounded up the criminals and freed the girls, her anxiety grew.

Finally, she confronted the gang leader with a swift kick. "Where are the other two girls?"

The leader sneered. "My men took care of them. They're gone."

The words hit Clara like a thunderbolt. Even though her sisters were strong, could they have survived?

Clara's anger boiled over. She punched the leader and aimed a kick at his groin.

"Sister!"

Clara stopped, turning to see her sisters, and rushed into their embrace, tears streaming down her face.

"Where were you?"

"We went up the mountain after lighting the fire, thinking you’d be back by now," Ethan Jade explained.

"Next time, no more splitting up."

"Are you kidding? There won't be a next time," Ethan said gently, smoothing Clara's hair.

As the officials took away the captured men, the sheriff finally caught up with them. "Where's Laney? Where's my daughter?"

Clara led the sheriff to the tree where Laney was hiding, helping her down.

“Dad!” Laney ran into the sheriff's arms.

Seeing the heartfelt reunion, Clara and her sisters quietly slipped away. They had done their part, and it was time to let the adults handle the aftermath.

As dusk approached, Clara, Ethan, and their sister decided not to return to their mountain hideout. Instead, they found an inn in town, planning to find a more permanent place the next day.

Once they left, three men emerged from a concealed spot. The most elegantly dressed among them squinted in the direction the girls had gone, a calculating glint in his eyes.

The night passed quietly, and the sisters awoke early. Unable to practice running, they resorted to using the room to maintain their strength.

"Where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you!" Clara encountered the frowning Evan Gray while searching for a new place.

"Did you really take me in just to abandon me?" he asked, a hint of disappointment in his voice.

Clara paused, realizing she had indeed forgotten about him.

"Well, what brings you here, my good student?" she replied, coughing lightly, trying to sound nonchalant.

"Grandfather sent me to deliver New Year's gifts, but it's already February."

"Let's just forget it for this year!"

"Grandfather said I should stay with you. I've finally found you, so you have to take me with you."

Clara considered this. She had promised Elder Gray, and having Evan around could be helpful, especially for errands.

In the end, with Evan's help, Clara and her sisters found a suitable house to move into. Although the location wasn’t perfect, it would do, costing Clara a total of $280.
