Clara Joy waited until Summer Lang had sorted out her affairs before stepping inside the shop with her.

“Thanks for helping me out back there," Clara said with a grateful smile.

“I honestly want to buy it, not just to help you out,” Summer replied, though her voice held a hint of doubt.

“I’ve been trying to sell this shop forever, but no one’s interested because the location isn’t great,” Clara admitted.

“That doesn’t really matter to me,” Summer shrugged, seeing Clara’s determination.

Resolved, the two signed the contract, with Clara purchasing the shop for a sum of money that included everything inside, as well as the property's backyard. They agreed to head to the county office later to finalize the paperwork, officially transferring ownership to Clara.

Standing in the middle of the shop and glancing around, Summer couldn’t help but tear up. “I feel like I’m failing. After my parents passed, I couldn’t even keep this shop going.”

Clara offered a reassuring smile. “Let’s hope we can bring it back to life together,” she said, gently steering the conversation toward their next step.

“What do you plan to do now?” Clara inquired as they walked to the county office.

“I haven’t really thought about it. It’s tough building a career as a woman these days. Maybe I’ll buy some land and live off the rent,” Summer replied.

“Why not work with me?” Clara suggested spontaneously. The idea had just popped into her head. Summer and her friend, Sophie, could help manage future shops.

“Work with you? What’s the plan?” Summer asked, intrigued.

“I bought this shop to continue the fabric business you started. I want to reach out to the seamstresses you worked with and make clothes. I’m planning to open a large marketplace, including sections for adults and kids," Clara explained enthusiastically. "We’ll turn this place into a workshop, and I want you to manage it.”

Summer’s eyes lit up. “Could we hire a lot of women to work here?”

“Definitely! This workshop will be a women-only space,” Clara affirmed.

“That’s fantastic! We can help improve women’s status at home. I’m in!” Summer agreed excitedly.

“You’re on board before I’ve even told you the salary?” Clara teased.

“It doesn’t matter how much; it’s better than doing nothing,” Summer laughed.

“At first, the marketplace won’t be open, so you’ll need to get the workshop up and running to ensure production is ready. I’ll pay you a fair wage, and you’ll be in charge of hiring, wages, and purchasing. I’ll provide designs and help with new styles. If you do well, there’ll be raises,” Clara promised, reassuringly patting Summer’s shoulder.

“Okay, I’m ready to give it a try,” Summer agreed, her resolve firming.

Clara and Summer signed a confidentiality agreement and a long-term contract. Clara had bigger plans beyond just clothing, envisioning products like women’s lingerie and other essentials, which could be quite profitable.

After their visit to the county office, Clara showed Summer her home and explained her vision for transforming the fabric store into a bustling workshop.

“When fabrics and materials come in, they’ll be stored out back. The shop will be set up with worktables for the workers. We’ll have different groups focusing on different items,” Clara detailed, outlining the layout and workflow.

Clara handed Summer some design sketches. “Here’s what Group One will work on,” she said, showing her the adult clothing designs. “And here are the designs for Group Two and Three.”

Clara also provided funds to cover initial expenses, emphasizing the importance of keeping detailed records. “If you run out, just let me know,” she added.

“Got it, boss,” Summer nodded, absorbing every word.

Clara sent Sophie along with Summer to learn the ropes, planning for her to manage the adult section. Clara trusted Sophie’s instincts and knew she’d do well.

Later, as Clara returned home, she was met by her friends, Jane and Mike.

“Is this the werewolf? Aside from the awkward walking, it doesn’t seem much different,” Jane remarked with a teasing grin.

Clara grimaced playfully. “Don’t provoke him; he’s got a temper,” she quipped.

“Clara, we wanted to talk about getting involved in your marketplace plans,” Mike said, getting to the point.

“I was planning to bring it up with you,” Clara nodded. “I’ve got roles in mind, but you’ll need to wait until we open.”

“Can you give us a clue?” Jane asked eagerly.

“You’ll manage the kids’ section, Jane. Your knack for crafting adorable dolls is perfect for it,” Clara said with a smile.

“Wow, you really know me, Clara! I love working with little ones!” Jane beamed.

“And Mike, you should explore some leisure activities for men in the meantime,” Clara suggested.

Mike’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re not sending me to those shady places, are you?”

“Of course not!” Clara laughed. “I’m thinking of setting up a proper leisure area with games like chess or darts.”

Reassured, Mike chuckled. “Sounds like a plan!”
