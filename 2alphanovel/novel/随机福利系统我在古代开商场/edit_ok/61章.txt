**Receiving Ivy**

"Ivy, what's happening?" 

"Mrs. Smith, please let us know what's going on. We can help you figure something out," Jake said, concern etched on his face.

Mrs. Smith glanced at the community leader and then at Jake. 

"The mayor's son has taken a liking to my daughter and insists on making her his girlfriend, and he's not taking no for an answer."

"When did Ivy meet the mayor's son?" The elderly community leader looked at Ivy, who was crying in despair, barely able to stand, supported by Jake's friends.

"Two days ago, Ivy and I went to sell homemade crafts at the farmer's market, and we just happened to run into him. He took a liking to Ivy and forced us to tell him where we lived. He said he’d come to take her away in two days—tomorrow, to be exact," Mrs. Smith sobbed.

“Mr. Johnson, I don’t want to date him; I want to make my own choices!” Ivy suddenly knelt before the community leader.

The old community leader sighed and looked towards Jake. “Jake, can I ask for your help?”

“To be honest, Mr. Johnson, my family has recently had some issues with the mayor's office. If this matter escalates and we offend them, it might not only jeopardize Ivy’s safety but also our family business here in Willow Creek. After all, the mayor has significant influence,” Jake's expression turned serious.

This was truly a tough situation. The mayor's influence was starting to overshadow Jake's family.

The family had advised against provoking the mayor for the time being. 

“Jake, could you secretly take Ivy away? I can tell everyone that she left on her own,” Mrs. Smith suddenly suggested.

“Mrs. Smith, my family doesn’t allow me to have any guests over without notice. This...”

Ivy listened to everyone’s discussion, her heart sinking deeper. Was there really no other way out for her?

"Rachel, may I ask you for a favor?"

"You want us to take Ivy with us?"

"Only you can help her."

“What do you want us to do? Even Jake knows it’s tricky to go against the mayor's office, let alone us outsiders.” Rachel politely declined; she was reluctant to get involved in any trouble.

“If we were to leave today, I would agree without hesitation. But we still have a few days here. Facing the mayor is clearly not a wise choice.”

“I can help Ivy get ready and disguise her as your assistant. We can take her back to the bed and breakfast, and she won’t come out until you all leave. What do you think of this plan?"

“But the owner knows how many of us are checked in. If I take one more back today, and the mayor's son comes tomorrow to find her missing, it would be easy for him to find out.”

“I can handle the owner. As long as the young lady is willing, it can be done.”

Rachel hesitated. In town, the mayor had a lot of power.

Her relationship with the mayor had already soured due to business dealings. If the mayor found out about this, it could easily become a trigger for further conflict.

“Please take me with you! I’m willing to be your assistant; I’d rather do that than be pressured into a relationship.” Ivy, seeing no other option, pleaded with Rachel.

“Please, I am begging you. I would work tirelessly for you.”

“That mayor's son is not a good person. Anyone who dates him will suffer. Please, save me!”

“Miss, I’m not useless either. I know how to cook, especially seafood dishes.”

Rachel was somewhat moved by this.

“Please, help her!” Her younger sister tugged at Rachel's sleeve and whispered.

“Don’t worry, I can ensure the people at the bed and breakfast will keep quiet. So even if the mayor's office discovers she’s missing tomorrow, they won’t suspect you.”

“Miss, I also beg you! I can’t let the girls from our community face such a fate!”

“Alright, since you can assure me that the owner will be silenced, I will take her in.” 

Everyone's faces lit up with smiles.

Mrs. Smith also knelt before Rachel, pulling Ivy along as they thanked her repeatedly. "Thank you, Miss! Thank you for saving her life!"

“However, if you follow me, you must be loyal, and you will have almost no chance of seeing your parents again.”

Ivy swayed slightly, glancing at her mother.

“It’s fine; not seeing you is okay, as long as I know you’re safe,” Mrs. Smith said, smoothing Ivy’s hair.

“Mother, I’m sorry; I can’t be there for you and Dad anymore,” Ivy bowed her head deeply.

Seeing this, Rachel felt a pang of guilt.

“Jake, let’s wander around the town a bit more. There are many places I haven’t seen yet.”

Jake understood her intention. “Then I’ll personally show you around.”

“Why don’t you tidy up and chat with your family? We’ll come back to get you when we’re ready to leave.”

“Thank you, Miss.”

Rachel nodded and started to leave.

“Miss, wait a moment.”

“Mr. Johnson, please write a contract of employment. I am willing to serve the Miss to repay her kindness.”

“There’s no need for that. I need someone who can handle cooking. You don’t have to sell yourself to me; just be loyal. Work hard in my business and earn plenty of money, and you can eventually bring your parents to live with us, and you can honor them."

Ivy was skilled and would find her place in her business, relieving her of one worry.

As Rachel and the others exited, they ran into Ivy’s father, who returned with a worried expression.

“Good day, Jake.”

The man looked at Jake and forced a smile.

“Zach, don’t worry. We have good news at home; hurry back!”

Under Jake’s guidance, Rachel explored Willow Creek.

“Jake, you’re truly a good person. The community speaks of you with immense gratitude!” Rachel couldn’t help but exclaim.

“It’s all exaggerated. I’ve only done a small thing,” Jake replied modestly.

“To you, it may be small, but to these folks, it’s significant,” Rachel's sister interjected, still feeling quite impressed with Jake.

“Your supply must extend beyond just Willow Creek; otherwise, it wouldn’t be sustainable,” Rachel suddenly turned the conversation back to business.

She had decided to negotiate a partnership with Jake's family.

“Don’t worry, there are many suppliers we work with. Whatever quantity you need, we can provide,” Jake replied with a smile.

“However, I must remind you, some people can’t eat seafood, so be cautious when you open your restaurant to avoid any trouble from them.”

Rachel took this warning to heart.

“Thank you, Jake, for the reminder. I will visit the trading firm tomorrow to discuss our business.”
