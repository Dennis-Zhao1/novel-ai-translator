**Different Thoughts**

"Mrs. Smith, I know the Smith family is known for their generosity, but this is what our family wants. If you're concerned about any rumors, we can handle this discreetly," Clara whispered.

Mrs. Smith looked at Clara, taken aback by the coldness of her request—those children were her own granddaughters.

"I can't make this decision alone; I have to speak with the family matriarch first," she replied.

Clara beamed, confident that this would proceed. Given how much the elder Mrs. Johnson favored her grandson, Johnny, this matter seemed almost settled.

"Then you should go back and ask her. I'll be waiting for your news at home. But since these are real people, shouldn't we raise the price a bit?" she suggested slyly.

Mrs. Smith scoffed, "Why are you in such a rush? Nothing is decided yet!"

"Alright, alright, I won't take up more of your time," Clara said, bowing her head in deference.

As she watched Mrs. Smith leave, Clara's smile vanished instantly. "Pah! She really thinks she’s something special, just another cog in the Smith family machine."

"Mother, how did it go? Did it work out?" Emily asked eagerly as soon as Clara returned home.

Clara glanced at her daughter-in-law, who was also her niece, and her expression darkened as she recalled what Ivy had said. However, remembering Ivy's sound advice, she held back her anger.

"We're just waiting on news, but I think it'll be settled. The money from your side should make up for the last mistake."

"Ah, I've been ready for that! Last time, my family needed it urgently, and they paid me back. But I thought I'd wait until I had enough to give you a round sum. Here, I have a couple of hundred dollars—this is from my son's wages and some freelance work I did, already converted into cash for you. It’ll be easier for you to manage," Emily sweetly said, though her heart ached inside.

Clara quickly took the money from Emily's hands and put it into her purse. "It's getting cold; I can buy a few more outfits for my eldest grandson."

At that moment, her expression darkened again as her gaze swept around the room, finally landing on Kate, who was huddled in the corner.

"Mother," Kate spoke weakly.

"Don't call me mother; I can't afford that title. If it weren't for you being my eldest grandson's mother, I would have had my eldest son divorce you already."

"Mother, please don't! I've made a mistake; I won't do it again!" Kate trembled as she stepped forward.

Before long, the sounds of Kate's cries and Clara's heavy breathing as she swung a broom echoed through the house.

"Oh, my savior has returned!" Ivy said from her hiding spot, peeking through the window.

"Grandma, did my mom mess up again? Please don’t hold it against her; it will upset your health, and I’ll be heartbroken. Look, today my friend recommended a jewelry store to me, and I bought you a bracelet!" Alex said, frowning as he strode over to Clara.

Clara quickly dropped the broom and took the bracelet. "My eldest grandson is back! Oh, you still remember your grandma. This bracelet is beautiful; it must have cost you quite a bit. Save your money for yourself; nothing makes me happier than seeing you well-off."

Clara's eyes glistened with gratitude. "My Alex is so thoughtful."

"Kate, just look at yourself, you disgraceful mother! All you do is embarrass Alex every day."

"Grandma, I'll talk to my mom later; please don’t worry about her. Come, let's go inside; I want to tell you about my school," Alex said, suppressing his annoyance.

Clara, charmed by Alex, had lost all her anger and followed him down the steps.

"Kate, since Alex is back, why don't you go buy some groceries?"

"Alex certainly has a lot of pocket money, to even buy a bracelet for you, Grandma," Emily said, staring at the bracelet.

"Aunt misunderstands. The bracelet was bought with my savings; I skipped many outings with friends, which made them distant. But for Grandma's happiness, it's worth it," Alex maintained his warm smile.

"My good grandson, you can't do that! It's important to maintain good relationships with your friends; it'll help you later. Next time, I'll give you more money so you can treat your friends more often."

Alex nodded, "Okay, I will listen to Grandma."

Emily watched the two leave, jealousy bubbling up inside her.

"Aunt, how does it feel to be working so hard for money? No matter how hard you work, Grandma only spoils my cousin. Ah, it seems Aunt will never have a son. I bet all the money in this house will go to my cousin in the future," Ivy said, dashing off to avoid Emily's wrath.

Emily felt a knot of anger stuck in her chest, unable to release. Turning, she saw someone at the door and could no longer contain herself.

"It's all your fault, you two shameless women, for taking up my womb and preventing me from having a son!"

Sam tightly held his younger sister Zoe's hand, unsure of what their mother was upset about now.

"Go inside."

The six-year-old Zoe shivered; every time their mother sent them back inside, they would be punished. But if they didn’t go, the consequences at night would be even worse.

"Are you going to move or not?"

"I'm taking my sister inside right now," Sam said, tears brimming in her eyes.

"What a hypocritical woman! Acting gentle outside but harsh to her own children at home. These two siblings are definitely not living well," Lucy said, filled with sympathy.

"Did my cousin do that on purpose?" asked Sarah, though it was more of a statement than a question.

Nancy's curiosity was piqued by this remark, and she looked inquisitively at Ivy.

"How could that be? I just said it casually to annoy Aunt," Ivy quickly shook her head, shooting a glare at Sarah.

Sarah realized Nancy was still there and awkwardly cleared her throat.

Nancy finally breathed a sigh of relief; she was worried this incident would change the children's personalities, but thankfully, it seemed alright.

However, Lucy and Sarah had made up their minds. Behind Nancy's back, they both gave Ivy a thumbs-up.

Although Sam and his sister were pitiful, that hardship didn’t make them kind-hearted. Instead, it twisted their personalities. When the original siblings were still around, they had often been bullied by the two, for in this household, they were always held in higher regard.

Later that evening, in Clara's room.

"Why are we keeping these three kids around? Are we just going to let them stay here and eat for free? And you even gave them extra for dinner tonight," Mark, the head of the family, asked impatiently.

"Don't be so anxious, dear. The Johnson family raised the price to a hundred dollars and sent word that we need to find a way to send these three children over tomorrow night."

"A hundred dollars? They’d never get that price elsewhere. We've raised them for over ten years; they owe us for the years they’ve lived. Did you agree to it?"

"Of course, I was the one who insisted they raise the price. How about that? I did well this time, didn’t I?"

"Mm."

Soon after, the room was filled with the sounds of hushed conversations and laughter...
