**No Boats Available**

As Clara Joy and her friends made their way down from the upper floors, they were greeted by a group of people waiting outside the door. The leader of the group greeted them with a broad smile.

"Welcome, honored guests. Please, follow me."

Clara kept a neutral expression and walked past him, while her sister, Comfort, flashed him an icy glare.

"Lead the way," Clara said, her tone a bit sharp.

When they arrived at the Smith family's trading house, Clara and her group were shown into a room filled with the scent of fresh coffee.

"Mr. Smith, the esteemed guests have arrived," announced a staff member.

"Please, have a seat," Mr. Smith invited warmly.

"May I ask why you summoned us, Mr. Smith? Was such an elaborate display necessary?" Clara's voice carried a hint of sarcasm.

"Please, no offense intended," Mr. Smith replied, turning to Comfort. "I assume this fine young man is the leader of your group?"

Comfort stayed silent, glancing at Clara for guidance.

Mr. Smith, a perceptive man, quickly sensed the dynamics.

"My apologies! It seems you are the true leader here," he said, directing his attention back to Clara.

"Leader is too grand a title; I'm just an ordinary woman," Clara replied modestly.

"I sincerely apologize for the manner of your invitation. Please accept my regrets," Mr. Smith continued, his tone becoming more formal.

"Let's cut to the chase, Mr. Smith," Clara interjected, steering the conversation away from pleasantries.

With a nod, Mr. Smith shifted focus. "You're here, I presume, to buy seafood?"

Clara didn’t deny it.

"Hasn't Mr. Smith already deduced that? Why ask again?"

"Presumably, you've heard of our Smith family business as the finest in this coastal town, providing top-quality seafood. We can deliver anywhere you need," Mr. Smith boasted.

Clara sighed at his persistence. "But what can be done? I intended to discuss business with your esteemed company, but the way Mr. Smith conducts affairs is... less than appealing."

"I apologize again and hope you won't hold it against us. My actions were only to ensure your visit," Mr. Smith insisted.

"Is that really an invitation? If we hadn't come, your inn would have had no customers today, and we wouldn't have been able to leave," Clara stated bluntly, not holding back her criticism.

Mr. Smith could only muster an awkward chuckle. He had never dealt with someone so unapologetic, unwilling to spare his reputation.

"Since you're here, let’s discuss business," he suggested.

"Honestly, Mr. Smith, we're looking to buy seafood, but it's just a small amount—not worthy of such a grand invitation," Clara politely declined.

That evening, Comfort and the others returned with news.

The Smith trading house had a reputation for being ruthless, often exploiting local folks and sometimes buying inferior goods to resell. In contrast, the Jordan family business was known for its integrity, often helping the local community and conducting business transparently.

However, Clara suspected that the Jordan family must have their own strategies to compete with Smith.

Still, the Jordan family's reputation was far better than the Smith family's, which convinced Clara to consider them for a business deal.

"How much do you wish to purchase, young lady?" Mr. Smith asked.

"We only want to buy a small amount for ourselves. I don't understand why you think there's business to be discussed. We were merely asking around to gather information, pretending we were looking to make a large purchase to avoid being underestimated," Clara said with an innocent expression.

Mr. Smith was caught off guard by her response.

He scowled, scrutinizing Clara. She sat upright, unfazed by his gaze.

Mr. Smith felt a surge of frustration; his assumptions were wrong. He had expected a wealthy client, only to find travelers inquiring.

"Mr. Smith, can we leave now?" Clara asked, her patience wearing thin.

"Are you truly not going to place an order for seafood? Our inventory is the most comprehensive," Mr. Smith pressed, still holding on.

"We're buying just a little bit, Mr. Smith. Do you really think we'd be interested in purchasing here?" Clara asked, feigning surprise.

Unexpectedly, her comment led Comfort to misunderstand, thinking Clara intended to place an order with the Smith family.

"Buy seafood, buy seafood! If we’re not purchasing here, let’s go to the Jordan family; they’re much better!" Comfort exclaimed, pulling Clara towards the door.

"You're trying to deceive me!" Mr. Smith exclaimed.

Clara quickly shot a warning glance at Comfort.

"Oh, dear! What are you talking about? Have you lost your mind again?" Clara’s friend, Serenity, hurriedly pulled Comfort back.

"Does the young lady look down on our Smith family?" Mr. Smith pondered Clara’s words. He nearly let himself be fooled by her.

At this point, Clara could no longer pretend.

"I don’t look down on the Smith family; I just dislike the way I'm being treated. Also, the reputation of the Smith family in this harbor town seems rather poor."

"Our trading house is unmatched in this town. If you don’t place an order with us, you may regret it," Mr. Smith said, his expression darkening.

"We've just arrived here and haven't decided where to place our order yet. There's no need for Mr. Smith to be angry; perhaps we could become partners in the future," Clara replied coolly.

With that, she prepared to leave.

However, Mr. Smith understood her words were mere excuses.

"You best not underestimate yourselves. Besides ordering from us, you have no other options. Just wait and see," Mr. Smith said, glaring at Clara and her companions as they turned to leave.

Clara ignored his threats, anger simmering beneath her calm exterior. She despised being coerced.

The next day, Clara learned firsthand about the Smith family's tactics.

She planned to explore the nearby villages, but the only way to get there from this town was by boat. After asking around, no one was willing to take them.

Clara raised an eyebrow. This situation felt familiar; it reminded her of their run-in with the Evergreen Gang, who had also made travel difficult for them.

At least back then, they had a place to stay and food to eat.

"No wonder the Smith family has such a bad reputation—this is how they treat people who don’t deal with them," Clara said upon returning to the inn, where Serenity’s face was flushed with anger.

"What do we do now? Are we really supposed to go to the Smith family and beg them?" Serenity asked, frustration evident in her voice.

"We won't go," Clara declared firmly.

"Then what do we do? We have no boats, and we can't even explore the surroundings!" Serenity's irritation was palpable.

"Do you think I’m really that foolish? Every time something happens, all I can do is panic and not think clearly—I’m just a burden," Comfort lamented.

"You are not foolish. You know things I don’t even understand yet," Clara reassured her.

"Sister, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have said that," Comfort said, fidgeting with her jacket as she sat beside Clara.

"It’s fine; Comfort only wants what’s best for us," Clara said, ruffling Comfort's hair gently.

"Just wait; someone will eventually be willing to give us a boat."
