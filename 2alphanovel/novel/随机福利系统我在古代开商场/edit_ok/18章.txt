**Unbelievable Luck, Exploding?**

By noon, Rachel Smith felt somewhat distracted.

“I wonder if they sold everything. We used so much sugar—if it doesn’t sell, it’ll be a huge loss,” she mused, her hands fidgeting with the edge of her apron.

Sarah, busy organizing the shelves, reassured her with a warm smile, “Just trust them. Lucy’s got a quick mind; she’ll definitely sell it all.”

Despite Sarah’s comforting words, Rachel couldn't shake off her anxiety. It wasn't until Lucy and the others returned, announcing that everything had sold, that she finally felt at ease. She circled the car parked in the driveway a couple of times to reassure herself.

Lucy counted the money, totaling twelve dollars and twenty-five cents. They discussed the pricing and decided to pay Emma and Jake a dime more than the market rate. They agreed on three dimes for apples and four for chestnuts.

Last time, Emma brought thirty pounds of apples and twenty pounds of chestnuts for a total of one hundred seventy cents. This morning, she sent another ten pounds of each from yesterday, amounting to seventy cents, which meant they owed her two hundred forty cents in total.

Jake delivered thirty pounds of each from yesterday, totaling two hundred ten cents.

Looking at the forty pounds of goods they had, Lucy felt a twinge of worry. It simply wasn’t enough.

“Mom, maybe you could ask around the neighborhood to see if anyone’s got extra apples and chestnuts they’re willing to sell,” Lucy suggested, considering the neighbors who might have a surplus of these items.

These items could be stored and were likely to sell well for a while. It was crucial for their family to secure a larger house before winter set in, and this depended on their success.

Rachel set off and soon returned with good news—many people were willing to help gather the goods.

In the afternoon, as Lucy and her companions were packaging the chestnuts and apples prepared by Rachel and Sarah, a faint yet urgent voice echoed in her mind.

“Due to the inability to capture what the host desires, the system has been continuously rewarding luck points. Now, the host's luck points are full, yet the system continues to accumulate...”

“Beep beep beep! Urgent situation: host's luck points are about to explode.”

The voice grew increasingly frantic.

“Ah, the luck points are going to explode! We have to protect Lucy!” 

“How do I consume the luck points?” Lucy sensed the urgency in the voice and asked in her mind.

“Anything will do! Hurry outside, or strange phenomena will occur, like wild chickens and rabbits rushing straight into your home!”

“Beep beep beep...”

“Beep beep beep...”

“I’m going out for a bit.” Lucy left that sentence behind, quickly grabbing a basket and heading out.

As she passed by the neighborhood pond, she clearly saw fish leaping near the shore, thrashing about.

It had been a long time since she had eaten fish, and Lucy swallowed hard.

Bending down, she scooped up a basketful, so heavy that she could barely lift it.

“Reward for the host: Permanent Strength Pill.”

A pill appeared in her hand out of nowhere, and without a second thought, she popped it into her mouth.

With a burst of strength, she managed to lift the basket, surprising herself.

“Not enough consumption, not enough!”

Lucy sprinted back, carrying the basket of fish weighing nearly a hundred pounds.

“Come with me! There are tons of fish by the pond!”

Seeing Lucy in a hurry, Sarah and Rachel immediately dropped their tasks and grabbed baskets.

Rachel hadn’t yet processed what was happening when the trio dashed off. She stood there for a moment, unable to find a basket, and finally just grabbed two wooden tubs from the kitchen.

On the way, they encountered neighbors who looked at the family rushing toward the pond with puzzled expressions. Upon seeing them return, they could no longer contain their curiosity and all started following suit, each grabbing a basket to head to the pond, but none caught a single fish.

After Lucy and her family returned, she called out to Sarah and Rachel to head up the hill again.

Rachel stayed home to guard the place.

To avoid raising further suspicion among the neighbors, the three of them took a rarely traveled path up the hill.

Last time, they descended with goods from this route, so Emma’s mom didn’t realize she had taken so much to their home; otherwise, things would have ended very differently that day.

They made it up the hill without a hitch, though there was still some obstruction as wild chickens and rabbits occasionally fell in front of them.

Finding a flat spot, the three sat down and watched as various wild chickens and rabbits fell before them in all sorts of bizarre ways. Some injured chickens couldn’t fly, others landed headfirst into the dirt, and some rabbits crashed into trees. Even more ridiculous were the rabbits that suddenly fell asleep right in front of them.

“This is too ridiculous! Lucy, don’t do this again next time; it’s too shocking! Just let her feel what you want and give you the rewards!” Sarah said, clutching her heart.

“Who knew it would turn out like this? The neighbors must be so confused.”

“Let’s just pretend we don’t know anything.”

Lucy nodded; there was no other option.

When a massive wild boar fell right before them, the system rewarded them with three storage bags, and finally, the anxious voice of Lucy fell silent.

Each of the three received one storage bag. Under Lucy’s guidance, they each dripped blood onto the bags to recognize ownership. Once claimed, the bags shrank into three circles that fit snugly around their wrists.

They packed their things into the storage bags and went back down the hill, empty baskets in tow.

Having just witnessed the fish leaping into Lucy’s basket, Rachel felt hopeful upon seeing the three return.

If luck really was this good, their future days would be splendid.

But to her surprise, the three returned with empty baskets.

“Nothing at all?”

“Nothing. I saw the fish jumping at the pond and thought I was lucky, which is why I brought my sisters back with me. Unfortunately, we didn’t catch anything. Guess it was just a fluke.”

“Cough, cough, Smith family.”

Rachel couldn’t contain her disappointment and sighed several times when she heard the old neighborhood leader’s voice from outside.

“Mr. Johnson, what brings you here? And everyone else?”

“The neighbors said they saw you all catching a lot of fish in the pond and asked me to find out how you did it,” Mr. Johnson said, his face slightly flushed.

“Mr. Johnson, why should we share our fishing methods with others?”

“We’re all from the same neighborhood. You caught so many fish so quickly; the pond belongs to everyone. You should share with us,” someone from the neighborhood chimed in eagerly.

“Mr. Johnson, we didn’t use any special methods. I just happened to walk by and saw the fish gathering near the shore, so I called my family to go fishing together. Even if we did have a method, we wouldn’t share it with the neighbors,” Lucy asserted firmly.

Some neighbors still thought her family was easy to bully and had no reason to demand anything.

“Look, you really can catch a lot; just let everyone know the pond is full of fish. It won’t interfere with your fishing.”

“And we’re all from the same neighborhood.”

“You ladies need our support, so let’s help each other.”

The neighbors chattered away, and Mr. Johnson felt he shouldn’t have come with such a soft heart.

“Quiet down, everyone! If they don’t want to share their way of making money, then so be it! Where do you get off talking nonsense? You should share your own ways of making money instead,” he barked, silencing the crowd.

“Everyone’s intentions are clear, but…” Lucy scanned the room and continued.
