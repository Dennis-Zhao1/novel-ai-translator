**Epilogue**

Ethan Jade and his friends were on a road trip when they unexpectedly ran into Clara Joy, who was heading back home. They stopped at a scenic overlook along the way.

"Who's that guy hanging around you lately, Clara?" Ethan teased with a playful grin.

"Just a buddy," Clara replied, trying to brush it off with a casual shrug.

"Really? Seems like he might be more than 'just a buddy,'" chimed in Clara’s sister, Sarah, with a knowing look.

Clara rolled her eyes, trying to ignore their banter as she focused on the road home. When she returned to town, she saw the local shopping mall was still under construction.

Ethan realized he had time to fine-tune the plans before the mall's grand opening. He spent his days training the team he'd hired to ensure everything would run smoothly.

On August 15th, the shopping mall finally opened its doors. The buzz of the crowd was overwhelming, keeping Ethan and his crew on their toes the entire day.

A month flew by since the opening, and they had already turned a nice profit. Just five days later, Clara's brother, Alex, felt a calling to join the military alongside their cousin, Chris, motivated by a sense of duty to protect their family from old rivals.

Another year passed, and Ethan’s family had become the wealthiest in their county. They had made numerous influential connections and expanded their reach significantly.

For a whole year, Young Master Carter had been showing interest in Clara, even though she often kept him at arm's length.

"Clara, where’s Carter today?" Ethan asked as he noticed Clara taking a break on the rooftop lounge.

"Not sure," Clara replied absently, her mind elsewhere.

"He left a letter for you!" Ethan exclaimed, catching Clara's attention.

As she opened the letter, a strange emptiness settled in her heart, though she couldn't quite explain why.

"If you care about him, maybe you should take a chance," Ethan suggested.

"He’s already taken ninety-nine steps towards you; the last step is yours," Sarah added.

"I… I don’t even know how I feel about him," Clara stammered, feeling caught off guard.

"We all see it, Clara," Ethan insisted gently.

"If you wait too long, you might miss your chance!" Sarah urged, tapping her foot anxiously.

Clara froze for a moment, then suddenly found herself sprinting out the door.

In the end, she caught up with Carter, and they finally confirmed their feelings for each other.

With the mall thriving, Ethan began to think of new ventures. He had his friends, Mike and Lisa, gather the local kids and teens, setting up a community center where they could learn new skills and engage in creative activities.

This act of community building made Ethan well-known and respected throughout the county.

Five years later, Ethan’s family had established successful businesses across the region. The young people they had helped along the way were now key parts of Ethan's expanding network.

He set up a security firm, which on the surface offered protection services, but secretly aimed to challenge the corrupt elite.

Once Ethan was confident in his relationship with Clara, he ensured she was always surrounded by friends and allies. Whenever challenges arose from the city, Ethan was always there to lend a hand.

Over the next five years, Clara and Ethan solidified their partnership. They were ready to take on new challenges as they headed to the city to expand their business empire.

During this time, Alex honed his skills and rose through the ranks, becoming a respected leader.

Upon arriving in the city, with Ethan's support, they discovered that the influential Su family was connected to their past. They approached the Su estate to uncover the truth. With the public watching, their father had no choice but to acknowledge them.

They encountered Shen Sumei, who had been working against them from the shadows.

The trio cleverly worked to reveal the corruption within Shen Sumei's family, exposing her father's misdeeds.

With no remaining support, Shen Sumei found herself isolated, and under Ethan and Clara’s guidance, she was brought to justice.

After settling old scores, they ensured their father faced consequences as well.

With that chapter closed, they focused on opening their new business in the city.

During this time, Sarah met a prince named Gavin, who, despite his initial plans to use her to gain power, gradually fell for her genuine and kind-hearted nature.

In the end, Gavin gave up his ambitions, choosing a quieter life with Sarah.

Once Ethan achieved his own goals, he invited Clara to share his success. Clara pretended to hesitate, playfully listing her conditions before agreeing.

Even as a successful businesswoman, Clara never gave up on her dreams. She traveled extensively to form new partnerships and foster growth.

At first, some in their circle expressed doubt, but over time, most came to support Clara's vision.

With every new venture, they established educational programs and community centers. Many young people succeeded in their careers, contributing to a thriving society.

Gradually, no one dared to speak against Clara, and some even suggested changes to traditional practices.

Ethan cherished Clara, allowing her the freedom to pursue her goals, resulting in a fulfilling and harmonious life together.

When Clara married Carter, their family bonds strengthened, and they supported each other through life's challenges.

Though the three sisters married into different families, they often reunited, each having found happiness with their partners.

Twenty years later, Ethan passed on his responsibilities, choosing to travel and enjoy life with Clara. When they grew weary, they returned home to spend time with their loved ones.

Living a life of contentment and joy, Clara always wore a smile, embodying happiness in every moment.
