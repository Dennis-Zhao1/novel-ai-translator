**Ghostly Encounter**

Inside the old carriage, screams pierced the air, but the people gathered outside remained eerily silent. Mary Smith, terrified to her core, cowered behind her two daughters-in-law, trembling uncontrollably.

Even Emily Johnson was momentarily stunned by the noise. After a long pause, she moved forward and lifted the curtain of the carriage.

"My dear girls, it's my fault as your mother. I can't let you leave this world so easily!" Emily exclaimed as she threw herself onto her three children.

Susan, along with the two others who had been awakened by the commotion, exchanged bewildered glances at Emily, listening to her heartbreaking sobs.

Susan and her two companions shared a knowing look, sighing in unison. They each suddenly gained a new memory in their minds. They realized they had somehow time-traveled to an alternate historical era. Fortunately, they weren't strangers but had been close friends in their past lives. After a tragic car accident claimed their lives, the three sisters had summoned them here. However, the exact method by which these sisters had brought them to this world remained a mystery.

“Mom, please don’t cry. We’re not dead,” Susan said, lifting her hand to pat Emily's back gently.

As soon as the words left her mouth, the cries abruptly stopped.

Emily pulled away from her children and saw three pairs of eyes staring back at her. She quickly pinched each of their faces and hands, exclaiming, “You’re warm! You’re really alive!”

“Yes, that's right! So please don’t be sad anymore, okay?” Susan blinked her eyes innocently.

Emily hurriedly wiped her face, not doubting for a second. Deep down, she had always refused to accept that her children had perished.

“Oh, thank goodness! My dear girls are back!” Emily exclaimed joyfully, tightly hugging her three children.

Outside, the crowd could only hear muffled sounds from within the carriage, unable to discern the words. Some began to wonder if Emily had been “taken by ghosts.”

“Ghosts!” Mary Smith squeaked in fear, but her head kept popping out from between her two companions to peek into the carriage. When she finally saw the three children helping Emily out, she recoiled in terror.

Seeing Mary’s frightened expression, Susan couldn’t help but smirk playfully, a mischievous smile dancing on her lips. She glanced at her two good friends; one was still lost in thought about how they arrived here, while the other maintained her usual cool demeanor from their previous life. It seemed she would have to take the lead in this situation.

But first, she needed to calm down the townspeople who were on the verge of panic. “Everyone, don’t be afraid! Since Grandma says we’re ghosts, then so be it...”

“Ah!” Some timid women shrieked in fear, some even bolting away.

“Don’t be scared! We promise we won’t harm anyone. Every grievance has its source, and we hold no ill will toward you,” she reassured, managing to calm the frenzied crowd somewhat.

Susan elbowed her companion, the second sister in this life, Sarah, while the eldest, Samantha, stood coolly to the side. They all had names that didn’t quite fit the village norms. However, in this village, they were simply referred to as “Big Girl,” “Second Girl,” and “Third Girl.”

“What’s wrong?” Sarah asked.

“Never mind that! Let’s go give that old woman a little scare!” Susan—now called Sophia—said, tilting her head towards Mary Smith.

Sarah nodded. “Let’s go! I’ve just sorted out my memories, and that old hag is too cruel.”

Emily overheard their conversation and narrowed her eyes, slipping away to the side. This scene was noticed by Samantha, who couldn’t help but show a barely perceptible smile on her otherwise calm face.

“Ah, don’t come any closer! Stay away from me!” Mary cried, backing away in a panic as she saw the two girls approaching.

The two women beside her, Alice and Nancy, were trembling in fear but didn’t dare to flee due to Mary’s imposing presence.

“Block them! Don’t let them near me!” she ordered.

Sophia twisted her neck, revealing a playful expression, while Sarah remained grinning at the three women in front of them.

As the trio kept their guard up against Susan and Sarah, Samantha had already stealthily circled around to their backs.

“Grandma, even if we three sisters have passed, we still remember your kindness. We specially came to inform you that we’re watching over you,” Sophia said, her gaze sweeping over Alice and Nancy. Suddenly, she covered her mouth in mock surprise. “Oh, right! We also brought a message from the beyond!”

“Please, no! You three just go!” Mary pleaded.

Suddenly, Samantha leaned forward, her voice icy. “Let’s go, ladies.”

Meanwhile, Sophia and Sarah bared their teeth, playfully growling at Mary and her companions.

“Ah! Help! The ghosts want to eat me! The ghosts want to eat me!” Mary shrieked, her feet frozen in place as she could only wail helplessly.

“I was wrong! Please spare me! I’m just the daughter-in-law of the family. I only targeted you because my mother-in-law despises you! Blame her, not me!” Nancy, the second aunt, fell to her knees with a loud thud.

Mary shot Nancy a furious glare. Just then, she noticed something swaying beside her and turned to see Samantha playing with a brick she had found, sending a shiver down her spine.

Sophia and the others caught a whiff of the smell and glimpsed the wet patch beneath Mary, rolling their eyes in disgust.

Alice’s eyes reflected her discomfort, but she kept a watchful gaze on the trio, finally coming to a realization.

“If you truly remember your grandmother’s kindness, you shouldn’t scare her like this. If you’re really going to repay kindness with malice, then come at me!” Alice retorted, indignant.

Sophia sized her up. This Alice was indeed clever; she probably saw through their little trick. But so what? They had achieved their goal.

“Indeed, the second aunt is quite filial. But I recall the last time Grandma twisted her ankle, it was you who purposely moved the stones, wasn’t it? Don’t deny it; I saw it with my own eyes. And that time you claimed to have lost money, we all know what you were really up to.”

Mary initially felt touched, but as Sophia’s words sank in and she noticed Alice’s evasive eyes, she understood the situation. However, she refrained from saying anything, knowing the three girls might just take her away, and Alice could still be of use.

“You heard that? Your second aunt is willing to take my place! Take her away!” Mary said, completely disregarding her own embarrassing situation.

“Yes, I’m willing to take her place,” Nancy chimed in.

“Clap, clap, clap!” Samantha tossed the brick aside and stepped forward, “What a show! Second Aunt’s filial piety is truly moving.”

“Yes, Second Aunt already figured out we are not ghosts but humans, yet she didn’t tell Grandma first. Instead, she let Grandma be scared, only to come forward and show off her ‘filial piety.’ How truly...”

“Are you really not ghosts?” a girl who had been quietly observing asked.

“Come here and feel for yourself!” Sophia replied.

“Ah! You’re really warm! And you have shadows too! What was I thinking? I should have figured it out! How could ghosts survive in the daylight? This is wonderful! You’re alive! I was so upset hearing Grandma wanted to arrange a ghost marriage for you! I’m so relieved!” The girl exclaimed, tears streaming down her cheeks.
