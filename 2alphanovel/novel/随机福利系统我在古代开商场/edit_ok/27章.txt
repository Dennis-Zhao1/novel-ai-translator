**In the Depths of the Cave, There Lies a Home**

"Beep! The host's luck value is about to max out."

One sunny afternoon, Clara Joy returned from the local farmer's market, her arms filled with goods from her stall. As she approached her house, she gave her sisters, Ethan and Kayla, a quick update on her plans before heading for a hike up the mountain.

This time, however, she unknowingly veered off the familiar trail. By the time she realized her mistake, her surroundings were entirely unfamiliar. Yet, Clara remained calm; she was confident her luck would keep her safe.

Determined to find a flat rock to rest on and test her luck, she searched until she found a suitable stone. It was covered by a wall of ivy. Just as she settled down, she lost her balance and fell backward. To her surprise, instead of hitting the wall, she passed through the ivy and tumbled into the ground.

Clara picked herself up, realizing she had stumbled into a hidden cave. The dense foliage had concealed a small passage leading into the mountain's depths. As she wandered through the cave, she marveled at its vastness. "This place is enormous!" she thought.

After some exploration, Clara found herself in front of a narrow passageway. She felt a compelling urge to continue, so she took a deep breath and pressed on.

At first, the path was so tight she could barely squeeze through. After about fifteen minutes, she felt water beneath her feet. Using the flashlight on her phone, she saw the path widen into a small stream. The water flowed gently, and as she continued forward, she unexpectedly came upon a small boat.

Clara climbed into the boat and began paddling. Suddenly, the current picked up speed. Startled, she closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she saw light streaming in from above.

After another fifteen minutes of paddling, she noticed a grove of plum trees on her right. Some trees were in full bloom, while others were just budding. The sweet fragrance filled the air as Clara steered the boat to the shore, stepping onto solid ground.

Breathing in the scent of the plums, she walked deeper into the grove and soon spotted a small patch of land where a man was busy tending to his crops. Every so often, he glanced toward a woman standing near a cozy-looking house.

"Man plowing, woman weaving," Clara thought, the phrase coming to mind unbidden. Even as an observer, she could sense the strong bond of love between the two.

"Hello there," the woman called out to Clara, her voice warm and welcoming.

The man looked up too, and Clara instantly recognized him. "It's you! Thank you for helping us that night!" Clara exclaimed, her gratitude flowing freely.

"Just passing through. I couldn't let those troublemakers disturb this peaceful area," he replied humbly.

"But you saved us. I owe you my thanks," she insisted.

The man fell silent, and the woman smiled brightly. "Please, come here! How did you find your way in? We're thrilled to have a visitor!" Her smile was radiant, and her affection for Clara was evident.

Clara felt a warm sense of familiarity wash over her as she approached. 

"You're so beautiful! You look so delicate and fragile; I would never guess you could climb the mountains!" the woman continued, her eyes sparkling.

"You've got the wrong idea! Though I may look delicate, I'm stronger than most grown men!" Clara replied with a playful grin.

An idea began to form in her mind.

"Is that so?" The woman chuckled.

As Clara grew more comfortable, she shared a few jokes that had the woman laughing until her stomach hurt. The man watched with approval, as it had been a long time since he'd seen his wife genuinely happy.

Seizing the moment, Clara suddenly knelt before the man. "Please, sir, take me as your student and teach me martial arts," she implored.

The man scrutinized her for a moment before replying slowly, "Training in martial arts requires time and dedication. Besides, you're already a bit older; you've missed the prime age for training."

"I'm willing to work harder than anyone else. I just hope you’ll agree to teach me," Clara urged, her determination evident.

The man remained silent, and Clara, equally stubborn, stayed kneeling.

Finally, it was the woman who couldn’t bear to see Clara begging, gently pulling her up. "Dear, give him some time to think it over," she advised.

"The sun is setting. You must be from one of the nearby towns. If you don’t return soon, your family will surely worry," she added.

But Clara stood firm, "Sir, I truly need to learn martial arts. I don’t want to be defenseless."

"Please," she pleaded, kneeling once more, her expression resolute.

The man furrowed his brows, deep in thought.

"I can heal your wife’s leg," Clara stated suddenly.

"What did you say?" The man's expression shifted to alarm.

While chatting with the woman earlier, Clara had noticed the limp in her gait.

"I can heal your wife’s leg," she repeated confidently.

"You're just a young girl. How could you possibly know medicine?" he questioned skeptically.

"I had a mentor who taught me. Unfortunately, he's since disappeared, and it's been hard to locate him. Very few know of my skills. But I’m confident I can cure your wife’s ailment," Clara declared with conviction.

“Dear…” The woman’s voice trembled as she called to her husband, tears brimming in her eyes.

"Fine. If you can guarantee you can heal my wife, I’ll teach you. And not just you; I can teach your sisters as well," the man finally agreed, a hint of hope in his voice.

"Thank you! Thank you so much!" Clara exclaimed, her heart soaring.

"Child, get up! Can you really heal my leg?" the woman asked, her voice filled with hope.

"Rest assured, I can do it, or I wouldn’t have spoken so recklessly," Clara reassured her.

"When will you start treating my wife?" the man asked, his voice trembling slightly.

Clara, having been a doctor in her past life, understood their anxiety completely. 

"I’m not fully prepared today, but I’ll come tomorrow afternoon to treat her," she promised.

The man set down his hoe and moved to embrace his wife, whispering comforting words. "See, my dear? I told you your leg would heal one day. Just hold on a little longer, alright?" he murmured, his voice tender.

The woman nodded vigorously, her eyes hopeful, clearly placing all their faith in Clara.

Clara felt a surge of confidence swell within her, especially since she had just received a reward of spiritual water from the system. This water, as she learned from the system's whispers, had cost her ten points of luck value to obtain.

"Bring your sisters along tomorrow. After I treat your wife, I’ll teach you all," the man instructed Clara.

"Okay, thank you, sir!" Clara quickly corrected herself, worried he might change his mind.
