**Buying Song Qingqing**

In the following days, Clara Joy's family was busy preparing ingredients at home. Clara's mother, Susan, also made both clear and tomato-flavored hot pot bases.

The day before they were set to sell at the local farmer's market, Clara invited Ethan and Ivy to help thread the skewers. That afternoon, Alex delivered three hundred bamboo tubes. That evening, everyone gathered to enjoy a rabbit hot pot, complete with both spicy and mild broth, leaving Ethan's son, Jack, who came home from school, thoroughly satisfied.

After dinner, Ivy pulled Clara aside.

"Hey, Clara, how much money do I still have with you?"

Clara raised an eyebrow, sensing something important was on Ivy's mind.

"Just a moment, let me check," she replied, heading to her room. In truth, she was pretending to look for the money; after getting the storage bag, she had stashed all the cash inside it.

"There's about two dollars and twenty cents," Clara announced as she returned, looking at Ivy. "Want to count it and see if that's right?"

Ivy shot her a playful glare. "Do you think I don't trust you?"

She stared at the jar full of coins with a sigh.

"What's wrong?" Clara asked, noticing her friend's expression.

"My mom is planning to marry me off to a widower soon. I wanted to use my savings to buy my freedom, but this amount is too little. She won’t agree."

Ah, so that was it!

"Don't worry, I have money. I can lend it to you," Clara said, wrapping an arm around Ivy's shoulder.

It was hard not to notice how well Ivy had grown; Clara couldn’t help but admire her friend's figure, feeling a twinge of envy mixed with admiration.

Ivy simply gazed at Clara, her eyes filled with unspoken gratitude, completely unaware of Clara's lingering gaze.

"Okay, I'll borrow it. I promise to pay you back slowly," Ivy replied.

"Of course, that’s fine," Clara said, swallowing hard.

Let’s not get the wrong idea; she was still into guys, but she appreciated beauty in all forms.

The next day, Clara and Susan set up their stall at the market, while Clara's mom and Ethan helped with the skewers. Clara felt confident that even without any marketing strategy, they would sell well. Just the aroma alone made her crave more.

After setting up the stall and lighting the charcoal, Clara began boiling the three different flavors of hot pot base. As the pots bubbled away, the enticing fragrance quickly spread through the area.

"Hey, what are you selling? It smells amazing!" an older man approached.

"Sir, we’re selling hot pot skewers, but we just started cooking. It’ll be a little while before you can buy," Clara replied, noting the man’s well-off appearance.

"How long will it take? If you take any longer, I might just drool away!" he joked, clearly intrigued by the delicious scent.

"This won’t take long, sir. Just a little bit more time," Clara assured, continuing to add ingredients to the pots.

Seeing that more and more people were drawn in, the man worried about losing his spot and smiled at Clara, "Then I’ll just sit here and wait. Do you have a bench?"

Clara handed him her own bench.

The man began chatting with her, and through their conversation, Clara learned his surname was Johnson. He was a traveling merchant who knew about various places and could even provide items from beyond the borders.

"Alright, it's done! You can all come buy now. Meat skewers are two cents each, and vegetable skewers are one cent each," Clara announced brightly.

Each skewer didn’t have too many pieces, which allowed for a lower price, but they would still earn a fair profit.

"Hey girl, hurry up and serve me first!" the man urged.

Clara handed him a bamboo tube. "Just pick what you want and put it in here, then head over to my sister to settle the bill."

"I want some of all three flavors," Mr. Johnson said, clearly eager.

Clara handed him two more bamboo tubes. As more customers gathered around, she stood back to ensure no one tried to sneak away without paying.

Susan was busy calculating the bills, barely able to keep up as the skewers varied in length for easy identification. Meanwhile, Clara continuously added more ingredients to the pots, ensuring no one had to wait too long.

Originally, Clara planned to sell for the whole day, but by noon, they had already sold out.

And so it went for the next half month; each day, business was booming, and they sold out before noon every time.

One day, as Clara and her companions entered the village, they spotted a crowd gathered around something. They could hear their mothers, Ethan, and Ivy among the noise.

“I’m not marrying him! He’s way too old! Are you trying to push me into a miserable life, Mom?”

“You silly girl, what are you talking about? Age brings wisdom; I’m doing this for your own good!” Nancy, Ivy’s mother, insisted, tugging at her daughter to come closer to the older men.

“Don’t think I don't know what’s going on. You and Dad just want to sell me off to make money for my brother's education!” Ivy shot back, her voice filled with defiance.

The villagers had been whispering among themselves, but Ivy's bold statement silenced them, revealing common views that daughters were less valuable than sons, and sacrificing a daughter for a son’s future was deemed normal.

“Ivy’s mother, this is about your daughter’s future happiness; you should really think this through,” Mrs. Smith spoke up, unable to comprehend why a mother wouldn’t care for her child.

“Exactly! Even if she has to marry, it should be for a respectable family,” Ethan added.

“This is my family’s business; why do you all care so much? If I don’t marry her off, are you going to pay for my son’s education?” Nancy retorted angrily.

“But Ivy earns twenty cents a day at my place!”

“Your work isn’t guaranteed every day, while my future son-in-law is offering eighty dollars!” Nancy dismissed them, showing no sign of compromise.

Mrs. Smith didn’t want to back down either. She figured if she could just delay things until Clara returned, surely there would be a way to save Ivy.

“Eighty dollars for marrying off your daughter to a man older than her father? It makes me wonder if you even care for her at all!” Susan chimed in from behind Mrs. Smith, defending Ivy.

Mrs. Smith immediately tugged at Susan, trying to quiet her.

“Ivy’s mother, we need Ivy to work this winter. It would add up to quite a bit of money,” Mrs. Smith insisted.

Nancy snorted, clearly looking down on the idea.

“Don’t meddle in my family’s affairs. Can your offers compare to eighty dollars?”

“Can you do better? How about ninety dollars?”
