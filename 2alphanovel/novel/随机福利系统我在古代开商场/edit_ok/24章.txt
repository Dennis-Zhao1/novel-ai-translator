**At the Mercy of Others**

"You... what do you mean?" Nancy's voice trembled as she glanced warily at Sarah, who stood behind Emily, feeling an unsettling fear creeping in.

"You weren't willing to let your daughter marry for eight hundred dollars, so how about I offer nine hundred?" Emily proposed, her tone casual yet laced with a hint of mischief.

Nine hundred dollars sent a thrill through Nancy's heart, but she feigned reluctance.

Emily could see right through her act. "If you're not willing, then go ahead and marry her off for eight hundred. After all, I'm offering an extra hundred here."

"Why are you hesitating? We had a deal, and you can't back out now," the man who had been called the son-in-law grumbled, clearly displeased.

"Deal? If you offer me an extra hundred, I'll hand over my daughter without a second thought," Nancy snapped, her patience wearing thin.

The man was momentarily speechless; eight hundred dollars was already a stretch for him, and he was deep in debt because of it.

"Did you really mean nine hundred to buy her?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

Emily nodded firmly, "Absolutely."

"Alright, bring me the nine hundred, and I'll take the girl."

"Wait a moment, I've called the town head here to write up a contract before we proceed," Emily replied, buying some time.

Nancy's eyes flickered with a mix of anxiety and impatience.

"We're all from the same town; why don't you trust me? If I sell her to you, she'll be yours, and I won't have any further ties to her."

Emily shot her a skeptical glance, suspicion written all over her face. "I don't trust you."

Nancy, feeling humiliated, could barely contain her rage. "You..."

"What do you want?" Sarah interjected coolly, stepping in front of Emily and glaring at Nancy.

Nancy instinctively took a step back, fearing that Sarah might harm her again.

"I—I don't want anything," she stammered.

"If you want money, just wait patiently. Once the town head arrives and the contract is signed, you'll get your payment," Sarah ordered.

Moments later, the elderly town head arrived, accompanied by his son, having been summoned by Jack. They brought along the pre-written contract, which Nancy reluctantly signed.

With the contract finally in hand, Emily brought Lily before her and handed over the nine hundred dollars to Nancy.

Nancy's eyes sparkled with greed, and she clutched the money tightly to her chest. "Let's go home."

"For now, you'll be living with the three of us," Emily said to Lily once they returned home.

"I'm sorry for the trouble. By the way, do you have any paper?" Lily asked.

"I think we have a few sheets. Do you need them?"

"I remember Mrs. Smith can read and write a bit. I'd like to ask her to help me write an IOU."

"Oh come on, do we really need an IOU between us? I trust you," Emily reassured her, genuinely believing in their friendship.

"I know you trust me, but even friends should keep accounts clear. Writing an IOU would make me feel better," Lily insisted, her seriousness prompting Emily to relent, feeling comforted by the straightforwardness of their friendship.

So, they called on Mrs. Smith to help draft the IOU.

"Mrs. Smith, could you write that I borrowed nine hundred dollars from your family?"

Emily frowned. "No, no. You've only used one hundred, so you only owe us eight."

"I still need to stay with you for a while, and that means rent too," Lily countered.

Emily tried to argue a few more times, but ultimately she couldn’t convince Lily otherwise.

Afterward, Lily continued to help Jane and Mrs. Smith with their crafts while Emily and Sarah set up stalls in the county to sell their goods.

Daily, after subtracting costs, they earned a stable income of about one hundred dollars, totaling six to seven hundred pennies.

As time flew by, it was now mid-October.

Emily and Sarah had returned home to join in the crafting when suddenly there was a commotion outside.

Mrs. Smith had just come back from the restroom and noticed everyone busy. "I'll go check it out."

Minutes passed, and as they waited, Mrs. Smith had yet to return.

"I'll go see what's taking her so long," Emily said, wiping her hands on a cloth.

"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?" Emily called out, searching until she found Mrs. Smith lying next to the shed, a piece of paper clutched in her hand.

Panic surged through Emily as she rushed to her, calling out Mrs. Smith's name until she finally opened her eyes, tears brimming instantly upon seeing her daughter.

Without asking what happened, Emily quickly checked if Mrs. Smith was hurt. After confirming she was fine, she lifted her and carried her back to the house.

"What happened? What's going on?" Jane asked, worry etched on her face.

The others, including Sarah, looked equally concerned.

"I don’t know," Emily replied as she settled Mrs. Smith onto her bed, noticing the paper still in her grasp.

"Mom, is this because of what's written on that paper?" she asked gently.

Mrs. Smith nodded, tears spilling over uncontrollably.

[Do you recognize this pouch? He never cherished it. I am his wife, the daughter of a senator. Before you met him, he married me in a grand ceremony. You are merely a fleeting episode in our happy family, or perhaps just a plaything of his. I know you have three children, and I initially planned to spare their lives, but now that you're thriving, I must regretfully inform you that soon, your children will be taken from you.]

As Emily finished reading, her fists clenched tightly.

"Do you realize he deceived you?" she asked urgently.

Mrs. Smith shook her head in disbelief.

"He gave Aunt Carol money, telling me he was heading to Washington to take exams and to wait for him at the Smith family. He promised he would come back for me. I never realized that he had a family already."

As she spoke, Mrs. Smith broke down, her sobs echoing through the room, bringing in the others who were outside.

Hearing Emily's words, Jane couldn’t hold back any longer.

"I told you he was lying! Why didn’t you believe me? Look at his demeanor—how could he be the simple man he claimed to be? And he's been gone for years! Did you really not suspect anything?" Jane scolded Mrs. Smith, pulling her into a comforting embrace.

Emily and the others, worried about Mrs. Smith’s emotional state, couldn’t shake off the chilling last words from the letter.

The daughter of a senator, with power and wealth, threatening to take their lives. How could they resist?

They were at the mercy of others, completely vulnerable.

"I'm not worried for myself, but for my children. What should we do?" Mrs. Smith cried out, her voice torn with despair.

"Jojo, maybe you should hide. Get the kids up and leave quickly, go into hiding," someone suggested.

"Yes, hurry, pack your things and leave," others urged.

But Emily and the others shook their heads.

"If she could deliver this letter to you, it means she has people watching us. There's no escaping this," Emily said, her voice serious.

Suddenly, a wave of urgency washed over Emily.

"Jane, you need to leave now! Take Lily and go home. We don't know when they'll come," she insisted.

Jane understood the gravity of the situation. They were all defenseless against those who might come, and staying wouldn’t change anything, but leaving felt wrong too; they were stronger together.

"I'll stay with you."

"No, you have your brother John to think about. You can't gamble with your life like that," Emily said firmly, pushing them toward the door.

Jane and Lily's eyes filled with tears as they choked out, "Please, be careful!"

"Don't go looking for help. Those people are skilled fighters; it wouldn't help," Emily warned, her heart racing at the thought of them being harmed.

The wait to be besieged felt interminable, and as the time dragged on, darkness finally began to descend.
