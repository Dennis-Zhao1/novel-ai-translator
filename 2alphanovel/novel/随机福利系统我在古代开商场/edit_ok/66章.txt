**Reencounter with Uncle Zach**

Mrs. Smith noticed her husband was still brooding, so she gave him a gentle nudge. 

"Honey, don't you care about our daughter? You have a chance to send her something; why are you acting like this?"

"Clara, could you do us a favor and check on my daughter? I know where she is," Mr. Smith said, urgency in his voice.

After addressing her husband, Mrs. Smith turned to Clara Joy, who stood nearby.

"Please let me know where she is."

"She's at Pine Ridge. Just a moment, I'll get some things for you to take to her, and I'd like you, Ethan, to help me write a letter."

Mrs. Smith stepped back into the room and soon returned with paper, ink, and a small pouch. She handed the pouch to Clara Joy, then dictated her message to Ethan, explaining what she wanted to say to her daughter.

"Honey, aren't you going to say anything to her? This is your last chance."

"Let's leave it at that. Clara, I'm counting on you."

Mrs. Smith took the letter Ethan wrote and gazed at it as if it were her own child. Seeing Clara Joy start to tuck the items away, Mr. Smith finally reacted.

"Could you ask Ethan to add one more thing? Tell her if she can't manage out there, she should come back," Mr. Smith said awkwardly.

"Dear, go get the money I've saved and give it to Clara to help take to her."

"Oh, so all that money was really for our daughter. You were so evasive when I asked you before," Mrs. Smith said with a smile.

"Hurry up, why do you have to talk so much?" Mr. Smith snapped, a bit flustered.

"Thank you, Clara. It's my fault; I've let my people live worse day by day."

"Mr. Smith has recognized the problem and is willing to change; I believe things will get better for you all in the future."

Mr. Smith lowered his head further, realizing how he had obstructed the lives of his people over the years.

"Yes, you're right."

"There's no need for you to blame yourself, I understand your intentions. The reason you've advised the community not to trust outsiders is that you don't want them to be deceived," Ethan reassured him.

"Please, Ethan, you don't need to speak for me. This has been my personal issue. Without your help over the years, my people might not have a place to call home," Mr. Smith said, regret heavy in his voice.

Ethan could say no more and maintained a polite smile.

Returning from the Smiths' residence to the dock town, Clara Joy turned to Ethan.

"Working with you gives me great peace of mind. We're preparing to leave tomorrow. Thank you for your help during this time."

"We leave tomorrow?"

"Yes, I plan to head east first, then venture beyond the border to check things out."

"Clara, you're quite an ambitious person—a true heroine among women."

"I hardly deserve the praise. I'll need your help with supplies."

"Don't worry, Clara."

Once back at the inn, Clara Joy informed everyone they would be leaving the next day. Ivy immediately took Banxia and headed out, returning with numerous packages of dried goods.

After five days of traveling eastward, Clara Joy and her group arrived at the eastern border of the Southern Valley Kingdom.

"There are many people here who don't look like they're from the Southern Valley Kingdom—they're so tall and strong," Ivy remarked as she observed the surroundings.

"Let's rest here for a day and find someone who speaks our language before we cross the border to the grassland tribes," Clara Joy instructed from her seat in the carriage, addressing Jack, who was driving.

They settled at an inn, and that evening, Clara Joy enjoyed a delicious plate of braised beef.

In the Southern Valley Kingdom, killing cattle without permission was strictly forbidden, even more so than harming humans. The town they were in was right next to the grassland tribes, where many cows were raised specifically for transportation to this location to be slaughtered and sold.

"Hey there, Clara?" 

Just as Clara Joy and her group returned from exploring the town, they were called out from downstairs.

"Uncle Zach?" Clara Joy recognized him as the man who had sold her the furs.

Zach Thompson appeared rosy-cheeked, evidently having had a few drinks. With a wide grin, he approached Clara Joy.

"What brings you all the way out here?"

"We're here to see if there’s anything new to stock in the market."

"I can't believe how far you've come, running into you here—it's such a coincidence!"

"Indeed, Uncle. Are you here to collect goods again?"

"My home is just nearby. I came back to visit my family and to gather some items from the grassland tribes."

Clara Joy's mind raced—this was exactly the person she needed!

"Uncle, do you know the language of the grassland tribes?"

"My wife is from a grassland tribe, so I often travel back and forth between the two regions. Of course, I know the language."

"Then could I trouble you to accompany us for a few days and help translate? I’ll pay you fifty dollars."

"You're straightforward, girl. I'm happy to do it for just twenty; it’s not that hard, just a few words here and there."

Clara Joy smiled and nodded.

"Great, then I'll count on you, Uncle."

"When are you planning to head out beyond the border? I need to go home and let my family know."

"We’ll be leaving tomorrow."

"Okay then, sounds good!" Uncle Zach replied cheerfully.

"Have you eaten? If not, you're welcome to join us." Zach Thompson said boisterously.

"We've already eaten, but thank you, Uncle."

"Alright, you all go rest. I'll finish my meal and then head home to inform my wife. I’ll be waiting for you outside the inn tomorrow morning."

"Ding, you've received a reward—a pimple remedy pill."

Back in her room, Clara Joy was surprised when the long-forgotten system voice chimed in.

"What is this?"

"This pill will cause the user to break out in red pimples for an hour."

"Why did I get this all of a sudden?"

"I don't know either, host. This is just something the system decided on its own."

Clara Joy placed the pill into her storage pouch, knowing it would surely come in handy later.

"Don't forget, there's another storage space you have."

Clara Joy paused for a moment; she had indeed forgotten about that.

"The storage space is different from the pouch. It can not only repair certain items but also has a larger capacity. If you don't use it for a long time, it will vanish on its own."

"I understand now."

Clara Joy took the pill out of her pouch and placed it into the storage space.

"Is this better?"

"Yes."

The next morning, after having breakfast at the inn, Clara Joy and her group were ready to set off. But Uncle Zach was nowhere to be found.

Clara Joy sat in the lobby, unsure of what to do.

"They're here! They're here! Clara!"

Clara Joy heard Jack's voice and stood up to walk outside. In the distance, she spotted Uncle Zach hurrying toward them.

"Uncle Zach, what happened? Why are you so late? You could have at least sent us a message to let us know we were waiting for so long!" Ivy complained, hands on her hips.

"I'm so sorry! I'm really sorry! I had some unexpected family matters to attend to, and it held me up for a while."
