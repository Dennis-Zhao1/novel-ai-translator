**Seeking the Werewolf**

The next day, Clara and her sister, Emily, waved goodbye to their friend, Sam, as Clara set off on her quest to find the werewolf that Ethan had mentioned.

As she arrived at Wolf Mountain, Clara immediately sensed that this place was different—a thick, almost ancient forest surrounded her. Occasionally, the cries of distant wildlife echoed through the trees, sending a shiver down her spine.

Clara trekked over hill after hill, yet she found no signs of human life. Suddenly, she heard two distinct animal sounds nearby, causing her heart to race with fear. She quickly scanned her surroundings but saw nothing, so she scrambled up a tree for safety.

From her high perch, Clara spotted two animals locked in a fierce struggle: a lion and a wolf. Beside the wolf lay a small pup that looked weak and vulnerable. Clara deduced that the lion was trying to take advantage of the wolf's recent motherhood, likely hoping to feast on the defenseless pup.

The lion's attacks were brutal, and Clara felt a pang of sympathy for the wolf mother. It was clear that the wolf was in a dire state, stumbling as it tried to defend its young. Yet, when the lion lunged, the wolf somehow managed to hold its ground.

“Awooo—”

Clara waited patiently as the battle raged on. Against all odds, the weakened wolf managed to kill the fierce lion. However, after the lion fell, the wolf collapsed alongside it, its legs flailing as if desperately trying to reach its pup.

In that moment, Clara felt a profound sense of maternal strength. She couldn't help but remember Ethan’s words about werewolves. A surge of compassion welled up in her heart.

Without hesitation, she leaped down from the tree and made her way towards the fallen wolf. As she approached, the wolf suddenly sprang to its feet but quickly collapsed again, clearly lacking strength. Despite its condition, the wolf's gaze remained fierce and wary as it eyed Clara.

When Clara picked up the small pup, the wolf let out a series of increasingly frantic howls. Ignoring the wolf mother's cries, Clara tore a piece of her outer garment and wrapped it around the tiny creature, cleaning its wounds as best as she could. Gently, she placed the pup back beside its mother.

Searching her backpack, she found some ointment and began applying it to the pup's wounds.

“Please don’t look at me like that. I’m here to help, not to harm. I promise!” Clara spoke softly to the wolf, hoping it would understand her intentions.

To her surprise, the wolf seemed to comprehend her words, shifting its gaze from Clara to the pup. When Clara approached again, it ceased its howling.

After bandaging the pup, Clara turned her attention to the wolf mother’s injuries. Just as she was about to treat the wolf mother, a figure suddenly lunged out from the bushes, colliding into Clara and sending her tumbling to the ground.

“Ah!”

Clara landed heavily, and as she looked up, she instantly recognized the creature standing before her. It was the werewolf Ethan had mentioned.

The werewolf eyed her with suspicion, poised to attack at any moment. They stared at each other, neither daring to make a move. Clara felt utterly unsure of how to communicate with this creature.

“I just want to help them!” she pleaded.

The werewolf, misinterpreting her words, let out a couple of threatening growls in response. Clara fell silent, pointing at the pup and then at the wolf mother, trying to convey her intentions.

When she attempted to inch closer, the werewolf growled again, ready to pounce. Clara retreated, remaining still. Just then, the wolf mother howled a couple of times.

The werewolf hesitated, its gaze shifting from fierce to questioning as it observed Clara. Taking a cautious step forward, Clara tried again, moving slowly.

This time, the werewolf didn’t block her path, but it remained close, radiating a tense energy as if ready to spring into action at any moment. Clara felt a wave of pressure wash over her. She hadn’t intended to use her special water, but given the circumstances, it seemed wise. After all, it could aid in healing the wolf mother quickly and perhaps earn her the trust of the werewolf.

As she tended to the wolf mother’s wounds, Clara applied the ointment and then retrieved a vial of special water from her bag, offering it to the wolf mother.

“Here, drink this. It will help you feel better,” she encouraged, hoping the wolf would understand.

Having already opened the bottle, Clara didn’t hesitate to share some with the pup as well. Finally, she extended the bottle toward the werewolf.

To her surprise, it opened its mouth wide, ready to drink.

Taking matters into her own hands, Clara poured some of the special water into the werewolf’s mouth.

After a few moments, the wolf mother managed to rise to its feet. The werewolf’s demeanor shifted dramatically, its attitude toward Clara becoming more amiable as it circled around her curiously.

How simple it was; just a little kindness had won over this creature’s loyalty. Clara gently reached out to stroke the werewolf’s head.

At that moment, the wolf mother called out again, and the werewolf carefully placed the pup on its mother's back, ready to leave. It noticed Clara was not following and turned back, calling out to her, even tugging at the hem of her pants with its hands.

Seeing the werewolf crawling like a wolf, Clara felt a pang of sympathy in her heart.

She decided to follow them, pulling out another vial of special water from her bag and holding it high in her hands.

Clara hoped this would encourage the werewolf to stand upright, and perhaps even help heal it. After all, the werewolf had lived among wolves for so long that its mental and social development might not be quite right.

When the werewolf saw Clara pouring out the same special water it had just consumed, it made a determined effort to leap up and drink. But no matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t reach the liquid.

After a moment of thought, it observed Clara’s movements, its eyes filled with confusion. Slowly, it mimicked her, standing upright and taking a few tentative steps forward.

Seeing this, Clara quickly extended her hand, allowing the werewolf to drink the special water.

As they followed the wolf mother deeper into the woods, Clara continued to encourage the werewolf to stand and walk upright, pouring out the special water whenever necessary.

Her welfare system had been showering her with special water without any signs of stopping, even after she had given some to Sam that morning.

Following the wolf mother, Clara soon found herself at the edge of a wolf pack. The moment the wolves spotted Clara, they began to stir uneasily.

Noticing this, the wolf mother rushed to a particularly majestic-looking wolf, howling a couple of times. The noble wolf responded with a few howls of its own, calming the pack and dissipating their hostility.

Clara followed the werewolf into a cave where a cozy nest made of grass awaited them, alongside piles of fresh meat.

Taking a seat on a nearby stone, the werewolf approached her, carrying a chunk of meat in its mouth.

“Do you want to come with me? You don’t belong here,” Clara murmured, though she knew the werewolf wouldn’t understand.

This was not a matter that could be rushed; she couldn't remain on this mountain for long—too many dangers lurked in the shadows.

Determined, she stepped out and sought the wolf mother, knowing she could communicate with it.

“He doesn’t belong here. He should come with me. Can you help me tell him?”
