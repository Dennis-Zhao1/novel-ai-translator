### The Old Chapel in the Rain

Clara Joy hurried home, but the sky gradually shifted, and soon a light rain began to fall.

Before long, the rain intensified, drenching her clothes and chilling her to the bone in the winter air.

All she wanted was to find a place to escape the downpour.

She recalled that there was an old, unused chapel not far ahead.

With renewed urgency, she quickened her pace.

As she pushed open the creaky door of the chapel, she was met with the unexpected sight of a knife pressed against her throat.

Squinting, Clara realized that despite having trained in self-defense for a year, she couldn’t even catch a glimpse of the man's movements, which spoke volumes about his skill level.

“Right now, go find a doctor,” he demanded, his voice cold.

Clara scanned her surroundings and noticed a frail man slumped in the corner, with an arrow protruding from his arm. He was dressed in luxurious garments, clearly someone of wealth, and different from the man holding her hostage—most likely his master.

Seeing the state of the injured man and the rain pouring outside, Clara's resolve hardened. She didn't want to remain soaked in the cold any longer.

“I know some medicine,” she boldly claimed.

The man who held her hostage clearly didn’t believe her.

“Quickly, or I’ll kill you.”

“Well, suit yourself if you don’t believe me. But let me tell you, your master can’t afford to wait. If I don’t find a doctor soon, he’ll be dead before I even finish,” Clara retorted, crossing her arms and pretending not to be scared, even though her heart raced in her chest.

The man glanced at his master, who was growing paler by the second, his lips tinged with blue.

“Don’t try to trick me, or else...”

“Or else you’ll kill me? Got it, you don’t need to repeat yourself,” Clara interrupted, her tone defiant.

Finally, she was allowed to step inside.

“Is there any hot water? I need a sip,” Clara demanded, walking over to the firewood pile with determination.

“Why are you drinking hot water? You should be treating your master,” the man warned.

“I’m freezing here! If I can’t warm up my hands, what if I make his condition worse?” Clara snapped back, her irritation bubbling over. Why did trouble always seem to find her when she just wanted to escape the rain?

“Here, miss,” a raspy voice said, and Clara turned to see the man at the fire handing her a cup.

“Thanks.”

After drinking the water, Clara warmed her hands by the fire before stepping closer to the injured man.

“Is there any alcohol?” she inquired.

The man who had held her hostage noted her approach and realized she was about to treat his master.

Though he was doubtful, he refrained from interrupting her.

“Here you go,” Clara said, taking a mouthful of alcohol before spitting it onto the wound of the injured man.

He grimaced, pain flickering across his features.

Then, Clara yanked the arrow out, noticing the flesh around the wound had turned an alarming shade. It appeared the arrow was poisoned.

Quickly, she poured some of her precious spirit water onto the wound and made sure to administer some directly into his mouth. Finally, she tore two pieces of cloth from the man who had initially held her hostage, soaked them in alcohol, and wrapped them around the injured man’s arm.

After finishing, Clara wiped the sweat from her brow, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

The man who had threatened her shifted his expression.

“What were you using on my master’s wound and what did you give him to drink?”

Since Clara had taken a sip before treating the man, he hadn’t stopped her, but his curiosity lingered.

“It’s a detoxifying and rapid healing remedy,” Clara replied, returning to her spot by the fire.

“Miss, drink some more hot water. Your clothes are soaked; you must be cold,” the raspy-voiced man advised kindly.

Clara accepted the cup, keeping her gaze fixed on the rain outside, silently wishing for it to end soon.

“Oh, by the way, my fee for treating your master is one hundred dollars,” Clara said, noticing the injured man had weakly opened his eyes.

“One hundred dollars? Why don’t you just go rob a bank?” the man who had held her hostage scoffed.

Meanwhile, the raspy-voiced man was busy feeding his master some water.

“Is your master’s life worth less than one hundred dollars?”

Clara had grown bolder, for the system in her mind reminded her that these three posed no real threat.

“Pay her five hundred dollars,” the injured man said, casting a glance at Clara.

“Master, this…”

“Just give it to her, and let her keep her mouth shut.”

Clara felt a flush of embarrassment; she could hear him perfectly well—there was no need for a middleman to relay the message.

“Don’t worry. I’ll act like I never saw you today. I’m not looking to stir up trouble for myself,” Clara said, accepting the five hundred dollars with a bright smile.

“Miss, do you have any more of that medicine you used on my master? We’re willing to pay a high price for it.”

“That was a rare formula left by my mentor; I only have one bottle left.”

“May I ask who your mentor is?”

“I don’t even know my mentor’s name; I rarely get to see him.”

“If you have more, we’ll pay one hundred dollars per bottle.”

The raspy-voiced man said, clearly noticing that his master’s condition had improved significantly compared to before.

They often traveled and frequently sustained injuries, and although their usual healer was skilled, none compared to the remedy Clara had just provided.

“Really, I don’t have any more.”

“Five hundred dollars.”

Clara shook her head; although she had eight bottles remaining, she wasn’t eager to profit from the system.

“One thousand dollars,” the injured man said, observing Clara’s frown.

“Deal. It’s a transaction.”

After all, what was the harm in a single sale? They were offering her a thousand dollars!

This was a significant step toward her goal of becoming financially secure.

“You’re lucky. This medicine is exceptionally rare; even a glimmer of hope can save a life. Selling it to you for a thousand dollars is already a bargain.”

The injured man’s face twisted with annoyance.

“Another two hundred dollars, and shut your mouth.”

Clara instantly fell silent.

“Is what you said true?” the raspy-voiced man asked after settling his master down.

Clara nodded, affirming the truth of her statement but also silently reminding herself to not let the prospect of wealth cloud her judgment.

“Do you have any left?”

Clara quickly shook her head.

Yet after witnessing the previous events, the man was skeptical.

“If you have more, we can offer an even better price.”

Clara shook her head vigorously, desperate to convey her honesty. She needed to stabilize her own emotions, telling herself that she couldn’t let money sway her judgment. Stay clear-headed, Clara Joy; don’t let greed take control!
