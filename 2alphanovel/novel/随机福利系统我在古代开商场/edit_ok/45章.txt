**Renting Land**

When Clara Joy returned home with Mr. Thompson, she took the evening to unwind. By the following morning, she was energized and eager to tackle her plans.

She recruited a team of construction workers, emphasizing that they should heed Mr. Thompson's guidance. The very next day, this crew set off to the plot of land Clara had acquired on the outskirts of the city. However, since she hadn't yet secured the necessary building materials, the workers began by clearing the site.

After navigating a few logistical hiccups, Clara discovered that the crew leader had a connection who sold bricks and tiles. She arranged a meeting to review the materials. Satisfied with the prices, she ordered a substantial amount of red bricks. With the remaining funds, she entrusted Mr. Thompson with a significant sum to purchase additional necessities, acknowledging her lack of expertise in the field and preferring to rely on his judgment.

That night, Clara lay in bed, tallying the finances. Together, the group had pooled fifteen thousand dollars—covering the fabric shop, providing working capital for Lisa, purchasing the land, acquiring bricks, and compensating Mr. Thompson a total of five thousand two hundred fifty dollars. This left her with nine thousand seven hundred fifty dollars.

“Wow, money sure goes fast,” Clara thought.

“Ding! Rewarding the host with greenhouse planting techniques,” announced the voice of her system.

After receiving the manual, Clara returned to the village. She first stopped by Chris Parker's home before heading to the local leader's house. The village leader had mostly retired, leaving many responsibilities to his son, Frank Smith.

“Hi, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Smith!” Clara greeted warmly.

“Clara, good to see you! Come on in,” Mrs. Smith quickly offered her a seat.

After handing over some gifts she had brought for the Smith family, Clara took a seat.

“I have something I’d like to discuss with Mr. Smith,” she said.

“Sure, go ahead,” the village leader replied.

“I want to rent some of the villagers’ land to build greenhouses for growing vegetables,” Clara explained.

“How do you plan to rent it?” Mr. Smith asked, intrigued.

“I’ll convert the annual yield of each acre into cash, compensating the villagers accordingly. This way, it’s similar to them farming for themselves, but the produce will need to be purchased,” Clara detailed.

“Let’s see… I can offer nine hundred dollars for high-quality land per year, seven hundred for medium-quality, and four hundred for low-quality,” Clara calculated in her mind before speaking.

The village leader was familiar with how much an acre could produce, and Clara’s proposed prices were fair—sometimes, a poor harvest wouldn’t even reach that amount.

“I can help you talk to them, but it will depend on whether the villagers are willing,” he said.

“Please inform everyone that those who rent land to me can work for me at twenty dollars a day,” Clara added.

“Alright, that should appeal to them. Such a stable job isn’t easy to come by,” Mr. Smith nodded.

“Frank, go gather the villagers. Let’s meet outside the community center,” he instructed his son.

As Frank was about to leave, Clara suddenly remembered something.

“By the way, please don’t notify those families who caused trouble at my home before about this,” she stated clearly.

Clara was firm in her stance; she wouldn’t pretend everything was fine with those who had wronged her. Even outside, she had ensured she got back at Mark Zane for his earlier offense.

Frank paused and looked at his father.

“Go on, do as Clara said,” Mr. Smith replied.

Once Frank left, Clara followed Mr. Smith towards the community center.

They waited outside, and soon, villagers began to gather. There were a total of forty-eight families in the village. Excluding those who had offended Clara and the Johnson family, thirty families remained.

As the villagers arrived and listened to Clara explain her land rental plan, many hesitated, unsure of how to respond. Only the Parker family immediately approached Clara, expressing their willingness to rent out three acres of land.

Others were convinced when they learned that renting out their land would also allow them to work for Clara. One by one, they agreed.

Frank took note of which families were renting land and how many acres they were willing to part with, while Clara distributed payments.

All the rental agreements were for three years. After that period, Clara would assess the situation and decide whether to continue.

In total, Clara managed to rent sixty acres of land: twenty-four acres of high-quality, thirty acres of medium-quality, and six acres of low-quality. It was clear that the villagers were cautious, as none were willing to rent out all their land to Clara.

She spent one hundred thirty-five thousand dollars to secure the lease. Since the Parker family was busy selling hotpot in the city, Clara didn’t reach out to Alex for the greenhouse construction.

After careful consideration, she decided to have Frank manage the operation.

Firstly, as the next village leader, he already had respect in the community, which would lend credibility to his authority. Secondly, Frank had a similar character to his father—upright and fair—but he was also firmer and not easily swayed by emotions.

“Are you really willing to trust me?” he asked, a hint of surprise in his voice.

“Of course! I’ve always known about Mr. Smith’s integrity,” Clara replied confidently.

“Alright, if you trust me to handle this, I’ll make sure everything is done properly,” he assured her.

Clara then shared the greenhouse construction methods with Frank, and Mr. Smith joined in to review them. The system provided two options: a basic wooden structure and a more robust metal one. Due to budget constraints, Clara opted for the wooden design.

While this method was less durable and prone to damage compared to the metal version, her financial resources were limited, and she couldn't help but feel frustrated.

Clara, accustomed to delegating tasks, finalized the construction method and handed over the greenhouse project, along with subsequent work arrangements, to Frank. She also gave him a thousand dollars.

“So much money? Are you sure you don’t need anything specific?” Frank asked, hesitating to accept the funds.

“It’s alright. I trust you, Frank. I’m a bit lazy and prefer not to worry about everything myself, so I’ll rely on you to handle it,” Clara said with a smile.

Frank suppressed his excitement and solemnly accepted the money.

“Don’t worry, I won’t mismanage a single dollar. I’ll keep accurate accounts,” he promised.

Clara laughed, feeling relieved. His straightforwardness made it all so much easier for her. She had initially worried that proposing this might lead him to overthink, but it seemed he was astute enough to understand her intentions.

“Great, then I’ll be counting on you, Frank.”
