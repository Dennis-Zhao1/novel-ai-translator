**Loss**

Clara Joy felt a deep ache for her sister, knowing how troubled she was.

“Mom, please get better soon. The chill is setting in, and we’re counting on you to help us make some new clothes,” Clara said, clutching Mrs. Smith's hand as she sat by the bedside. But there was no response from Mrs. Smith.

“You girls should just focus on your lives. Your mom may need some time to heal,” suggested a gentle voice from the room.

Clara nodded, knowing their small food stand hadn’t opened in days. Luckily, Clara’s other sisters—Ethan Jade and Sophie Quinn—were always home, so they didn’t have to worry about Mrs. Smith doing anything drastic.

The next day, Clara and her sister Susie Quinn headed into town to sell some street food. On their way back to their neighborhood, they noticed their neighbors giving them sympathetic looks.

“Mrs. Brown, what’s going on?” Clara asked a neighbor passing by.

The woman hesitated before finally saying, “I’m so sorry for your loss.”

Clara’s heart sank immediately.

James Owen, who overheard the woman, quickened his pace toward Clara's home.

“Get out! Get out of our house!” Clara’s sister Susie screamed, her voice filled with anguish.

“Mom, don’t leave us!”

Outside their modest home, several people stood, and upon seeing Clara and her sister, they instinctively parted to let them pass.

Clara felt as if her feet were made of lead as she walked inside.

The scene that met her eyes was heartbreaking: Mrs. Smith lay motionless in the courtyard, her eyes closed, with a pool of blood surrounding her head. Tears streamed down Clara’s cheeks uncontrollably.

Just days ago, Mrs. Smith had been so determined to protect them.

“You’re back. Mom was killed by them! They did this!” Susie pointed accusingly at Mrs. Green, who stood to the side.

Clara narrowed her eyes.

“Don’t go making baseless accusations, you brat. She fell and hit her head on a rock,” Mrs. Green said, her voice shaky.

“Isn’t it because you pushed her?” 

Clara stepped back and approached a neighbor. She pulled out a small sum of money. “Could you please help us find some authorities at the county office?”

She then gave Sophie a knowing look.

Sophie understood immediately, and together they restrained Mrs. Green and her accomplice with ropes.

“Why didn’t you call the community leader?” Clara asked, trying to comfort Susie.

“Quinn went to get him, but he’s out of town today.”

“I finally had a mother who cared for me, and now she’s been taken from us!” Susie cried, struggling to catch her breath.

“Hey, I’m really sorry. I went back to grab you some vegetables when I saw you didn’t have much left. I didn’t know that when I returned, she would be gone. It’s my fault; I shouldn’t have left,” Aunt Penny said, filled with regret.

“Don’t blame yourself, Aunt Penny. You don’t need to feel guilty. Right now, we should focus on preparing for the funeral. We’re not experienced in this, so we’ll need your guidance,” Clara said, shaking her head.

“Let us go, you witches! This has nothing to do with us!” Mrs. Green continued to scream, while her accomplice stood silently, her face pale with fear.

Sophie shot a cold, piercing glare at Mrs. Green, silencing her with fear, before turning to get a cloth and stuffing it into Mrs. Green’s mouth.

Since the authorities hadn’t arrived yet, Clara and her sisters didn’t dare to move Mrs. Smith's body.

Leaving Sophie behind, Clara followed James and Aunt Penny to town to buy what they needed for the funeral.

By the time they returned, the officials had arrived.

“Here you go, two truth pills for the host,” someone declared.

“It’s not my fault! I swear it’s not my fault!” Mrs. Green's accomplice finally reacted upon seeing the officials, repeating the same line over and over.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Green continued to defend herself, and while the officials were distracted, Clara discreetly slipped a pill into Mrs. Green’s mouth.

“I pushed her. She deserved it. That ungrateful woman! I only came to taunt her because I heard she was sick, and I thought I’d take care of that little brat while the others were away. But she went mad and pushed me out. I lost my balance and accidentally pushed her into the yard. I didn’t expect her to hit her head on a rock and die. I wanted her to suffer, but I didn’t want her to die like this. Those girls won’t let me off the hook.”

“Officer, my sister and another person who helps out at our house are witnesses. She’s already admitted to it, so we don’t need to conduct further investigation, right?” Clara said, slipping a small bribe into the chief officer’s hands.

The officer, initially thinking this trip wouldn’t yield much, was pleasantly surprised by Clara’s savvy.

“Yes, she has already confessed. We will take her away now. Rest assured that our superior handles matters fairly,” the officer assured.

With Mrs. Green and her accomplice taken away, Clara and her sisters finally had the chance to clean Mrs. Smith's body and dress her in her burial clothes.

Perhaps it was the bribe, but the next day, they were notified that Mrs. Green would be imprisoned for about ten years, while her accomplice, having not laid a hand on Mrs. Smith, would not face any sentencing.

After Mrs. Smith's burial, life began to return to normal, though Susie struggled with her grief.

Clara and Sophie decided to let Aunt Penny and Sophie handle the food stand at Aunt Penny's home, keeping Susie close by.

Through this ordeal, Clara realized that the three of them needed to learn some self-defense. They also needed to earn more money to hire skilled protectors because trouble seemed to find them.

As time passed, Susie gradually emerged from her grief, returning to her usual self.

Seeing her sister like this brought Clara and Sophie relief; they had feared that Susie would retreat into a shell.

One day, while at their stall, an unexpected guest arrived.

“Are you really that heartless? That was your grandmother!” 

“Heartless? Who can kill their own daughter and still be considered kind?” Clara shot back.

“But Grandma didn’t mean to! She didn’t intentionally push Auntie towards the rock,” Nathan, standing to the side, protested.

“How did you all turn into such cold-hearted people? This is wrong. Girls should be soft and gentle. Do you know how much this affects my career?” 

“Your career has nothing to do with us,” Clara retorted.

“I’m still your cousin! If I succeed, I can definitely help you out,” he added.

Clara shot him a disdainful look, not wanting to hear any more of his hypocritical nonsense.

But Sophie couldn’t take it anymore and shoved Nathan aside.

“If you care so much, then go back home and ask your family for money! Maybe your grandmother can get out a few years sooner,” Clara said scornfully.

To her surprise, Nathan actually took her words to heart and went home to speak with his family—not out of concern for Mrs. Green, but because he feared his career might be jeopardized.

Although, ironically, he hadn’t even passed his preliminary exams yet.
