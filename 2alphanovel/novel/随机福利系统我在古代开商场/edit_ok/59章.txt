First Encounter with Zach Chen

"Clara, who do you think will come looking for us?" Emily asked, intrigued by her sister Clara Joy's musings.

"Well, Emily, in this town, we have the Smith family and the Chen family. Considering how the Smiths have been acting, the likelihood of us choosing them is slim. But if the Chens step in to help us navigate our current troubles, we'd definitely be appreciative," Clara Joy explained, her voice steady yet hopeful.

"So, if the Chen family helps us, we'll naturally feel more inclined to work with them, right?" Emily pondered, beginning to grasp the situation.

"That's what I'm thinking, but it's not guaranteed," Clara Joy admitted, a hint of uncertainty clouding her voice.

Emily gave Clara Joy's hand a comforting squeeze. "We should be patient. I believe your logic is sound. The Chen family should know this is a golden opportunity."

"Let's hope so," Clara Joy replied, her heart fluttering with anxiety. What if the Chen family didn't want to face off against the Smiths for such a small venture? What then?

Watching her sister, Emily felt a pang of sympathy, silently berating herself for not being able to better support Clara Joy through this.

"Miss, if it comes to it, maybe we could be a bit more assertive. I can't imagine they wouldn't help us," Bella chimed in, frustration evident in her voice as she turned to Emily.

"Bella's got a point," Emily nodded, finding some truth in her words.

"But then we'd be no better than bullies," Clara Joy interjected, playfully tapping Emily on the head.

Instantly, Emily's mood soured, and she shot Bella a glance. Bella, feeling the tension, shifted her gaze away innocently.

"Don't worry, Miss. How about some coffee?" Sam suggested, entering with a steaming pot from the inn.

Just then, a series of knocks echoed from the door.

"Ladies, someone downstairs is looking for you," a young attendant announced.

Clara Joy quickly motioned for Emily to open the door.

"Dear guests, the Smith family sends word that if you agree to collaborate with them now, they will overlook any past grievances."

Clara Joy felt disappointment wash over her; she had hoped it would be someone from the Chen family.

"Please let them know that even if we don't order seafood, we will not be collaborating with the Smith family," Clara Joy replied with a firm tone to the innkeeper.

"Miss, I advise you to reconsider. The Smith family has significant influence in this town. They're offering you a chance now, so you should accept. Otherwise, it might become very difficult to operate in Dock Town in the future."

"Thank you for the warning, but I don’t feel secure collaborating with the Smith family," Clara Joy stated firmly.

With a sigh, the innkeeper left.

"Clara, you don’t think the Chen family will really not come, do you?" Emily asked, concern etched on her face.

"Mr. Collins, could you take Cedar out for a moment?" Clara Joy asked.

"What do you need, Clara?"

"Just spread the word that we plan to order a significant quantity of seafood and will be looking to place long-term orders."

"Got it."

After some time, Mr. Collins returned with Cedar and nodded at Clara Joy.

"Clara, we found a café not far from the Chen family. I believe our news has reached their business by now."

"Great job."

Just as Clara Joy finished speaking, a voice called from outside the room.

"Ladies, someone is looking for you downstairs," announced another inn attendant.

Clara Joy stood up, noticing her brother Benji standing still, showing no inclination to move.

"Benji, what’s wrong?" she asked.

"Sis, you and Emily go ahead. I won't go. I’m worried," he admitted.

Clara Joy understood his hesitance from yesterday's troubles and offered some comforting words. But Benji resolutely shook his head, refusing to go.

With no other option, Clara Joy asked Mr. Collins to stay behind with him, bringing Cedar along just in case.

"Miss, are you planning to take a boat to the surrounding villages? I'd be happy to take you," said a young attendant peering in through the door.

"You're from the Chen family, aren’t you?"

The attendant was surprised Clara Joy recognized him so quickly.

"Yes, my boss sent me to escort you."

"Perfect! Let’s go then."

Clara Joy followed the attendant to the shore, where she spotted a larger boat, already occupied by a charming young man.

Upon seeing Clara Joy and the others, the young man stood up gracefully.

"I'm Zach Chen."

"This is Clara Joy, and this is my older sister," Clara Joy introduced.

The head of the Chen family seemed younger than the Smiths and was strikingly handsome, his face always adorned with a gentle smile that made one feel at ease.

"Which village would you like to visit?" he asked.

"Anywhere is fine for us to look around."

"Then let’s head to Little Fisher Village; it’s where we source our goods."

Clara Joy was impressed; this was a true businessman, directly taking her to see the goods.

"That sounds perfect. Thank you, Zach, for providing us with a boat."

As the boat gently glided away from the shore, Clara Joy and Zach Chen remained silent at first.

It wasn’t until they were far from the shore that Zach broke the silence.

"I heard you came to Dock Town to order seafood."

"Yes, that's correct."

"Then I won’t beat around the bush. I believe you are already familiar with my Chen family, so I would like to discuss this business with you."

Hearing his words, Clara Joy felt a slight shift in her impression of the Chen family.

They surely knew about her standoff with the Smith family, yet he didn’t mention it, applying no pressure.

"You must have heard about our situation with the Smith family. Right now, our only choice is to work with you."

"Miss, that’s not quite right. To be honest, seafood isn't exclusive to our town. When we negotiate business, my Chen family aims to satisfy you, not because you have no other options."

"I hope you will willingly collaborate with us and that we can meet your expectations in terms of attitude, sincerity, and quality of goods."

"You truly are as they say, Zach."

Clara Joy felt a deep admiration for Zach Chen.

At the same time, she recognized her own shortcomings; compared to such a businessman, she had much to learn.

"Then I hope you can meet my expectations in every aspect."

"Of course."

"Where are you from, Miss?"

"Greenfield County."

Soon, Clara Joy and Zach were engaged in light conversation, discussing the types of seafood she wished to procure.

"Miss, your ideas are quite innovative; opening such a large market is something I've never heard of before."

Clara Joy smiled, effortlessly steering the topic away.

"You’ll see my marketplace here in the county soon. You must come to support me when it opens, Zach."

Clara Joy didn’t hide her ambition at all.

Zach felt a rush of excitement; her words indicated that they might establish similar marketplaces in every county.

That would require a significant quantity of seafood…

Zach's heart raced with anticipation.
