**Resurrection? Or Another Trick?**

"Please, Mom! I beg you, don’t let them take the Nier sisters away!" Ivy's desperate plea rang out in the small town square, causing heads to turn toward the commotion.

Hearing her daughter's voice, Mrs. Smith instinctively glanced toward Mrs. Johnson, who stood nearby with an air of impatience.

"Sarah, Jessica! Hurry up and pull your sister back!" Mrs. Smith barked her orders, her voice carrying authority.

The two women exchanged quick glances before rushing forward. Sarah grabbed Ivy's arm, trying to pull her away from the old wooden carriage.

Ivy clung desperately to the carriage, her nails scraping against the wood in a futile attempt to hold her ground. The sound echoed through the chaos, drawing the attention of the gathered crowd.

"Mrs. Smith, what’s the hold-up? You said you were in charge, so why the mess now?" Mrs. Johnson frowned, clearly annoyed by the delay.

"Don't worry, Mrs. Johnson. I'll handle it right away," Mrs. Smith replied, forcing a smile and nodding reassuringly.

Mrs. Johnson shot her a disdainful look from her elevated position. "Hmph! The ceremony is waiting; don’t delay any further!"

Mrs. Smith nodded repeatedly, but as she turned back to Ivy, her expression hardened.

With a swift motion, she slapped Ivy twice. "Get out of the way! Are you ignoring your mother's wishes now? The Nier sisters are going to a better place, so why are you blocking their path?"

"A better place?" Ivy's eyes burned with anger as she glared at Mrs. Smith, her gaze filled with icy disdain.

Mrs. Smith's eyes flickered, realizing she was losing control of the situation. Her voice rose as she defended herself, "How is it not a better place? They've suffered so much, and I've arranged for them to be at peace together so they won't be lonely!"

Seeing Ivy's unwavering defiance, Mrs. Smith dramatically sat down on the ground, lamenting loudly, "Oh, what a burden I bear! I raised them with love, and now I have to ensure their peace even after they're gone. And look how they repay me!"

"If I had known it would come to this, I wouldn't have taken them in at all! My life is truly miserable…" She pounded her thighs in a theatrical display, eliciting eye-rolls from onlookers.

Mrs. Johnson watched Mrs. Smith's antics with disdain, shifting her gaze elsewhere. Indeed, she was just a woman adept at making a scene.

Ivy, seeing her mother's performance, softened her expression, filled with helplessness. "Mom, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have looked at you like that, but please, don’t let them take the children away. They are already gone; just let them rest in peace."

"Auntie, we all understand your good intentions. Please let Nier and her sisters go in peace," urged Emily, a kind-hearted woman from the town who was friends with Ivy.

At her words, other women in the crowd chimed in.

"Yes, Mrs. Smith, let the children be buried at home."

"No way!" Mrs. Smith shouted, then quickly realized her tone was too harsh. "Listen, this arrangement cannot be canceled, no matter what!"

At that moment, the town's mayor finally arrived, supported by Emily's son, Mike. Upon seeing Mrs. Smith in the crowd, he couldn't hide his annoyance.

"Mrs. Smith, what are you causing a ruckus about this time?" 

Mrs. Smith lifted her chin defiantly. "Oh, Mayor, you're here! But this is a family matter. You can't interfere!"

"What you're doing is inhumane and will be condemned by everyone."

"You don’t need to worry about that. As long as the children are at peace, I don't care what others say."

The mayor was furious at her unreasonable behavior and decided he didn’t want to waste any more words on her.

"Sarah, where's your father?"

Sarah looked back, still holding her position. "I don’t know; he went out."

Before the mayor could respond, Mrs. Johnson's cold voice rang out. "Time is running out! If this isn't settled soon, we’ll leave! There are plenty of families eager to join the Johnson family through this arrangement!"

If it weren’t for maintaining the Johnson family's reputation, she would have ordered someone to clear the way.

"Sarah, Jessica! Are you two starving? You can’t even hold onto one person! If you don’t stop her, you won’t eat dinner tonight!"

Upon hearing this, the two women steeled themselves. No matter how much Ivy resisted, she couldn’t compete with their combined strength.

Seeing Ivy being pulled away, Mrs. Johnson waved her hand, and the bearers rushed to lift the carriage. But with three bodies inside, they moved slowly.

Ivy was in despair, shouting, "No! My children!"

"Give my children back! Let go of me!" She screamed, fighting against Sarah and Jessica.

"Quick! Hold her back! Don’t delay the Johnson family’s schedule!" Mrs. Smith had never seen her daughter in such a state; she looked as if she was about to go mad.

Emily, watching from the sidelines, felt tears streaming down her face. Taking a deep breath, she rushed to help Ivy, trying to break her free from the grip of the others.

"This is our family matter! What does it have to do with you, Emily?"

"As a mother, I can't bear to see this scene."

Upon hearing Emily's words, several soft-hearted women in the crowd rushed to help, while others gathered around, trying to block the carriage.

Though they didn’t know why they were doing this or what difference it would make, they couldn’t let the three sisters be taken away like this.

But no one dared to look at Mrs. Johnson; everyone kept their heads down, pretending to chat casually.

Seeing the extra hands helping Ivy, she struggled even harder. Mrs. Smith quickly called for her granddaughters to assist, rolling up her sleeves and joining in.

"Get away from me!"

"My children! My children!"

"Auntie, please let Ivy go. Don’t let them take the children away!"

"Ah! It’s so noisy! Can you all be quiet?" The voice rang out, instantly silencing the crowd, all eyes turning toward the source.

"Zombie resurrection!" The bearers were the first to react, dropping the carriage and fleeing.

The crowd erupted in chaos, scattering in all directions.

Inside the carriage, the shortest of the "corpses" frowned in annoyance.

"I said to be quiet! How can the sick rest with all this noise?"

Ivy was the first to react, her eyes widening. "It's Annie! Mom's Annie!"

"Who are you, and why are you shaking my bed?" Annie, filled with irritation, opened her eyes, ready to give these noisy people a piece of her mind.

"Ghost! Help!"

"Ah! Who are you?"

"Can you be quiet?"

"Ah!"

"Ah!"

"Ah!"
