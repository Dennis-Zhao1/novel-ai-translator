**Money Flows Like Water**

Clara Joy, Ethan Jade, and the others helped Mrs. Smith walk toward the old cottage, and from a distance, Clara couldn't help but feel a sense of doubt creeping in.

The cottage was at the edge of the small town, rarely visited by anyone, leaving the area desolate and overgrown with weeds towering over them. The structure was in such a state of disrepair that it looked like a strong wind might bring it down. Some of the shingles were missing from the roof, and inside, you could probably see the sky.

"This place isn’t too bad, right?" Clara Joy tried to reassure herself, her voice carrying a hopeful lilt.

"You're just kidding yourself," Ethan Jade countered, not missing a beat.

"Okay, okay," Clara Joy shrugged with a smile. "Looks like we've got some work to do today."

Leading the way, she carefully stepped through the overgrown grass to make a path for the disoriented Mrs. Smith.

Once inside, it was empty—there wasn’t even a chair to sit on. Well, there was some grass growing, at least.

"It's all your fault, Mom. You’ve let us down," Mrs. Smith sobbed, her face filled with regret.

"Mom, please don’t think like that. Leaving the old house, we don’t feel wronged at all. This is great! Just the four of us, living our own lives, without having to serve anyone else. The difficulties we face now are only temporary. We will make sure you live well in the future, so please don’t feel sad," Clara Joy couldn't bear to see her mother in such a state, and spoke up to comfort her.

"Exactly, Mom! Try to be a little happier; otherwise, it makes me feel bad," Shu Yu added, shaking Mrs. Smith’s arm gently.

"You need to pull yourself together. If you don't, we really won’t have anywhere to sleep tonight," Ethan Jade said, lacking the knack for sentimental words but with a touch of humor.

Mrs. Smith could keenly sense the change in her eldest daughter’s attitude toward her.

"Are you blaming me for not bringing you out sooner?" Mrs. Smith couldn’t help but ask.

"No, you’re overthinking it. We’ve only got this afternoon; let’s just focus on getting things organized."

Mrs. Smith sighed, wiping away her tears, gazing at Ethan Jade with a pleading look, hoping she wouldn’t blame her.

Seeing this, Clara Joy was ready to step in and speak up. After all, in her past life, Ethan Jade had grown up in a loving family, and her feelings for her previous parents ran deep. Given her personality, she might not say anything soft-hearted.

As expected, Ethan Jade remained silent and moved to the side to start clearing weeds.

"Mom, Big Sis has probably been too tired these past few days. She wouldn’t blame you; we all know you are doing this for our sake."

"Oh dear, this place is really something!" A voice called out from the doorway.

"Aunt Sara!" Clara Joy exclaimed, with Shu Yu following closely behind.

Seeing Sara arrive, Mrs. Smith decided not to dwell on her feelings and resolved to make it up to her children in the future.

"Sara, what brings you here?"

Sara tossed down a few garden tools she had been holding, "If I don’t come, how will you manage to get things organized this evening? You don’t have any tools!"

"Come on, let’s work together. We need to get as much done as possible. Don’t just sit there feeling sorry for yourself. You should have moved out sooner; this is much better. Don’t let it affect the kids!"

Hearing Sara's words, Ethan Jade raised an eyebrow; she found this woman more to her liking than Mrs. Smith.

"And I sent your husband to borrow a cart from the town chief. He should be back soon. Whoever is at home needs to go to town to buy things; he’ll take them with him," Sara continued, cutting grass as she spoke.

Mrs. Smith thought it over. She definitely couldn’t go, and given the recent events, Clara Joy was the most suitable choice.

"Let Clara go with him."

No sooner had she spoken than sounds came from outside.

Clara Joy, clutching all their belongings, climbed onto the cart with Sara's husband, Mr. Lee, to head to town.

"Clara, what do you plan to buy?"

"We have nothing at home—tools, pots and pans, food supplies, and clothes. We need to buy all of it."

Mr. Lee nodded, understanding, and planned the route.

Their first stop was the hardware store, where Clara Joy purchased two pots, a spatula, a garden tool, a kitchen knife, and two metal basins.

Next, they headed to the general store to buy bowls, ceramic pots, ladles, and wooden buckets.

Then, they went to the clothing shop, where Clara Joy bought eight sets of simple clothing and some ready-made quilts. Finally, they visited the grocery store, where she bought thirty pounds each of flour and rice, along with various essential seasonings.

Watching the coins flow out of her hands, Clara Joy felt like her heart was bleeding.

Noticing that Clara Joy didn’t buy any cooking oil, Mr. Lee nodded in approval; the girl was quite thrifty.

He pulled Clara Joy over to the butcher's shop, where she bought two pieces of lard. At that time, cooking oil was exceedingly expensive, so lard was a better deal, plus they could eat the cracklings.

Thinking about the cracklings made Clara Joy swallow hard; she hadn’t had them since she was a child in her past life, and the delicious flavor was still fresh in her memory...

"Clara, let’s settle the bill and be on our way," Mr. Lee urged as the butcher finished weighing the lard, but Clara Joy was still distracted, looking around.

He had planned to make a table and a few stools for Clara Joy's family later that afternoon!

"Mr. Lee, wait a moment. Please add two pounds of pork belly for me."

Mr. Lee hesitated at first, but remembering that they had just moved out, he thought it wouldn’t hurt for them to have a good first meal. However, he felt that for just four women, two pounds of meat seemed excessive.

"Clara, meat is expensive. For your family, half a pound would be just right."

"Not enough. You’re also having dinner at our place tonight," Clara Joy replied with a cheerful smile.

"You’ve just moved out; life is tough. We wouldn’t want to impose on you," Mr. Lee said earnestly.

Clara Joy immediately pouted, looking quite unhappy. "How could we not feed those who help us? Mr. Lee, do you think our place is too shabby?"

Mr. Lee quickly denied it.

"If you don’t join us for dinner, then when you get back, you won’t need to help us anymore."

Mr. Lee, a straightforward farmer, couldn’t argue with Clara Joy and quickly gave in.

After the butcher finished weighing the meat, he noticed Clara Joy’s eyes were fixed on a bucket of pig’s feet nearby.

"Young lady, are you interested in pig's feet?"

Clara Joy nodded eagerly, her big eyes blinking innocently.

Her demeanor melted the butcher’s heart, a burly man who couldn’t help but feel soft.

"Since you want it, I’ll do you a favor and give you this pig’s foot for free."

Clara Joy was overjoyed and hurriedly thanked him, "Thank you, sir! You’re such a kind person."

Mr. Lee couldn’t help but admire how easily Clara Joy managed to get a free pig's foot. Though it might not be worth much, on ordinary days, some folks would buy one just to satisfy their cravings, which still cost a bit!

Later, Clara Joy also begged Mr. Lee to take her to buy some vegetables, but this time he refused, insisting he had some at home and would bring her some later.

On the way back, Clara Joy counted her spending. Wow, she had just spent over five dollars! Most of that was on iron, as she had opted for sturdy pots, which meant the hardware store had cost her over three dollars!
