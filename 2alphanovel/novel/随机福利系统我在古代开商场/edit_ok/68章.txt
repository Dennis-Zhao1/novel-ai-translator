**Chapter One: Unexpected Encounters**

As the last of the crowd thinned out, the figures of strangers fading into the distance, Clara Joy shoved Ethan Jade away with a sudden burst of frustration. Straightening her jacket and smoothing down her hair, she tried to play it cool, preparing to make her escape. But before she could take a step, Ethan's hand shot out, gently catching her wrist.

"Where do you think you're going without settling up?" he asked, his voice carrying a playful edge of authority.

"Oh come on, Ethan, remember the last time we helped her out? You said she owed you fifty bucks," Clara retorted, throwing a glance over her shoulder at the retreating figures.

Ethan's scowl deepened slightly. "Exactly, and it’s time for her to pay up. No money, no running off."

Clara bit her lip, a resigned look crossing her face. "I don't have that kind of cash right now. Can I just owe you?"

"Not a chance. If you run, I’ll find those folks and bring them back," Ethan teased with a mock threat, his eyes narrowing with a hint of mischief.

At that, Clara's bravado crumbled. "No, please! I’ll get you the money right now!" she pleaded, desperation creeping into her voice.

With a heavy heart, she reached into her purse, pulling out a hundred-dollar bill with a pained expression. "Here, take it."

"You're still short by twenty bucks," Ethan pointed out, his tone teasing but firm.

Clara grimaced, her lips pressing into a pout as she muttered under her breath. "Fine, take it." She handed over the remaining cash, turning her head away to ignore the sting of her dwindling funds.

"Good job, Clara. Now, Ethan, don’t forget to thank the lady," he instructed himself with a self-satisfied grin.

"Thank you, Miss," Ethan said, his tone dripping with mock politeness.

Clara rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Next time you have such a 'great' deal, you know where to find me!"

She turned her back on them, her annoyance palpable, while Ethan strolled away, a hint of amusement in his stride. Clara watched him go, tapping her foot on the ground in irritation.

"Are you okay, Clara?" her sister, Autumn, asked gently, concern etched on her face.

"No, I'm not! That’s a hundred bucks gone!" Clara moaned, her expression one of sheer distress.

"Alright, alright, let’s not dwell on it. Just let it go," Autumn soothed, patting Clara's back in a comforting gesture. Clara had always been a bit of a penny-pincher, and it seemed nothing could upset her more than losing a small fortune.

Feeling deflated, Clara had no desire to linger any longer. She wanted to return and count her dwindling savings. "Autumn, you stay. Yu Jin and I will head back."

"I’m heading home first," Clara grumbled, her usual cheer absent from her voice.

"Go on, don’t think too much about it. Just treat it like you fed the dogs."

"Right! Just feeding the dogs. That makes it easier to swallow. But I’m still going back."

As Clara walked along the path back to the inn with Yu Jin, she refrained from making any additional purchases, lost in thought.

Suddenly, "Whoa..."

"Watch out, Miss!" Yu Jin cried, her voice laced with urgency as she saw Clara, who was obliviously walking with her head down.

Realizing too late, Clara quickly sidestepped, just as a cyclist sped past, completely oblivious to the people around him. The crowd scattered, but Clara’s attention was drawn to a young girl standing frozen in the middle of the street, wide-eyed and helpless.

Without a second thought, Clara sprinted forward, grabbing the girl just in time to pull her out of harm's way as the cyclist whizzed past.

"Are you alright?" Clara asked, concern flooding her voice.

The cyclist, clearly irritated, shouted something at Clara, words that didn’t need translation — they were obviously curses directed her way.

But Clara didn’t want to escalate the situation. She turned her focus back to the girl. "Are you okay?"

"Thank you for saving me," the girl replied, her voice trembling.

Clara took a moment to truly see the girl — she was breathtakingly beautiful, with a natural grace that made her seem almost ethereal. The girl had delicate features, a soft complexion, and a gentle aura that drew Clara in.

"Are you sure you're alright?" Clara pressed, her heart aching with empathy.

"Really, I’m fine. Thank you for your concern," the girl said, blushing slightly as she lowered her gaze, feeling the intensity of Clara’s stare.

Clara’s heart raced as she realized how entranced she was by the girl. "Please, no need to bow in gratitude. I couldn't let anything happen to you."

The girl smiled shyly, her expression warming Clara’s heart even more.

"Do you live around here? Let me escort you back to ensure your safety," the boy who had been with the girl suggested, his demeanor earnest.

The siblings exchanged a glance before the boy spoke again. "We live in a small place at the end of the street. It’s not much, but it’s home."

"What about your parents? Are they with you?" Clara inquired, her curiosity piqued.

"Our mom passed away, and our dad remarried in another state. He doesn’t care for us anymore," the girl replied, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Clara felt a pang of sympathy at the revelation. "I’m so sorry to hear that. I didn’t mean to bring up painful memories."

The girl quickly wiped away her tears. "It’s alright. We get by on the kindness of strangers."

"Would you consider coming with me? I can’t promise riches, but I can ensure you won’t have to worry about food and clothing," Clara offered, feeling an urge to help.

The boy and girl exchanged thoughtful glances. "We’re grateful, but I don’t want to put my sister in a position of servitude," he said, his protective instincts kicking in.

"You wouldn’t have to serve me. Consider it a job. Think it over, and if you decide to join me, I’ll need a way to contact you," Clara urged, her determination clear.

"Let us return home and discuss it. If we choose to come with you, we’ll find you," the boy replied, his expression serious.

Clara nodded, acknowledging their need for time to think. They made their way to the inn together.

"This is our place," Clara said, gesturing to the establishment.

"You haven’t eaten lunch yet, have you? Let me order some food for you two. Afterward, you can head back," Clara said, her kindness shining through.

She now knew their names — the boy was Alex, and the girl was Lily.

As Clara placed the order, she stood by the innkeeper, waiting for the calculation, but before the innkeeper could finish, Alex had already calculated it.

"That’ll be twenty-two dollars and seventy-five cents," Alex stated confidently.

"Wow, you’re fast!" Clara remarked, raising her eyebrows in admiration. Alex was proving to be quite useful.

With a business in need of a manager, Clara realized Alex could fit the role perfectly. If she could bring them along, it would solve her staffing issues.

Returning to her room, she retrieved some funds from her savings. After the last venture, she still had around six thousand dollars left.

"Tomorrow, I’ll negotiate some business and get home early. There are too many places out here that drain your money," Clara resolved, a determined glint in her eye as she planned for the future.
