**The Drugging: A Tale of Deception**

Clara Joy felt a rustle in the air and instinctively glanced at Sarah, who seemed utterly unfazed. Breathing a sigh of relief, Clara bid her farewell and made her way into the quiet woods.

“Relax, Clara. The system is just for you; no one else can see it. Time to get your rewards,” a voice echoed in her mind.

Clara focused intently, trying to sense anything unusual, but everything felt normal.

“Where are you?” she asked aloud.

“I’m part of you, but intangible. You can’t see me,” the system replied.

“Part of me? So you know everything about me and could easily harm me?” Clara questioned, her voice laced with caution.

“I wouldn’t harm you! I only know what you choose to share, and I’m here to reward you with useful items. I exist only because of your wishes,” the system, known as Willow, replied, its tone growing softer and more anxious.

Clara detected a hint of defensiveness and fear, recognizing Willow’s sincerity. “You mentioned rewards?” she prompted.

“Oh, right!” 

A set of silver needles suddenly materialized in Clara's hand, shimmering in the light.

Clara opened the case, her eyes lighting up as she examined the needles. In her previous life, she had studied medicine, and these needles were unlike any she had ever seen. They were soft yet resilient, a rare combination that was perfect for precise work.

“Anything I produce is top-notch. Aren’t I useful?” Willow chirped excitedly.

Clara nodded, realizing the needles' timely appearance was crucial for her and her sisters' safety.

“Just remember, you said I could make you disappear with a single word. So, don’t deceive me or do anything harmful,” Clara warned.

“Willow would never lie or act against your interests. My original creator designed me to help people like you from alternate worlds,” Willow explained earnestly.

“Your creator must be impressive to have created something like you,” Clara remarked.

“She was, but she’s been gone for a very long time. I barely remember how long,” Willow said wistfully.

“Have you had other hosts?” Clara asked, curious.

“I have. Every few centuries, I bond with someone new. But it must be someone my creator deemed fated. Your sisters are from another world too, yet only you were chosen,” Willow elaborated.

Clara now understood more about the system and pondered its implications for her. “So, you only provide rewards. Do I have to complete tasks for them?”

“No, our relationship is always under your control. Rewards appear randomly,” Willow reassured her.

“What’s in it for you? Why bond with hosts?” Clara inquired, skeptical.

“I gain merit points by bonding with a host until their end. With a thousand points, I can access my creator’s world. But if I upset a host and they end the bond, I lose a hundred points. So, I’m always in your best interest. Please trust me,” Willow pleaded.

Clara felt a pang of sympathy for Willow, realizing it was more burdened by penalties than rewards, much like her past work experiences. After asking so many questions, she decided to trust Willow for now.

“How many merit points do you have?” she asked.

“Ninety-nine. You’re my most important host,” Willow replied.

That evening, Mrs. Smith not only had the Miller and Smith families prepare chicken soup, but also bought several pounds of meat for them to cook. She even instructed Heather to make four servings of egg custard.

“I don’t know what’s gotten into Mom. She’s being so nice to those kids,” Heather said, grumbling in the kitchen.

“Mom has her reasons. Besides, those kids were really scared,” Mrs. Miller replied, connecting Mrs. Smith’s unusual behavior with the suggestion made the day before.

Heather shot Mrs. Miller a suspicious look. “Mom isn’t that kind-hearted, and you’re acting strange today.”

“I’m not odd at all. Let’s just cook before Mom starts urging us,” Mrs. Miller insisted.

“Eat up, you three. You’ve all lost weight lately,” Mrs. Smith said, serving each of the sisters a piece of chicken.

Clara smiled sweetly. “Thank you, Grandma! You’re so kind!”

Mrs. Smith’s expression turned sour, a chill running down her spine. What was with this girl? So unsettling.

That’s right, I’m disgusting you, you old bat, Clara thought while chewing her chicken, maintaining a cheerful facade.

“Heather, head back to your room. The kids will sleep in the room next to us, which I’ve prepared,” Mrs. Smith said gently after dinner.

Hearing this, Heather felt warmth wash over her. It seemed her mother truly realized her mistakes after all, considering the children were her granddaughters.

“Thank you, Mom. Clara and the others will definitely honor you in the future,” Heather said, visibly moved.

Clara watched her sister, who was touched by Mrs. Smith’s words, and knew how hard it would be for Heather to handle the truth tomorrow. But if they exposed Mrs. Smith now, she could easily deny it, so they had to play along for now.

“Exactly! We will take good care of Grandma!” Jessica chimed in, emphasizing her words.

“This is some syrup I made for you. Drink it before heading to bed,” Mrs. Smith said as she and Mrs. Miller brought in three bowls after Clara and her sisters returned to their room.

“Look how nice your grandma is! You’re the only ones in the house besides Tommy. Drink it while it’s hot,” Mrs. Miller said, handing the bowls over.

The sisters exchanged glances, signaling the moment had arrived!

“The syrup is too precious. We should save it for Grandma,” Clara said, acting considerate.

The next morning, Thomas, along with Uncle Hank and Uncle Mike, headed off to work in town, so Clara didn’t mention saving any for them.

Mrs. Smith’s eyes flickered. “Go on and drink. There’s plenty more at home, and I don’t want to drink too much before bed.”

“Alright, Grandma. You and Aunt Heather go ahead and get busy. We’ll drink it and return the bowls shortly,” Clara replied.

Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Miller showed no concern that the sisters wouldn’t drink. Previously, they had watched John drink and had been quite envious.
