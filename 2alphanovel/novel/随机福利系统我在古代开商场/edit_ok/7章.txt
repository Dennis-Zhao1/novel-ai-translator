### Ethan Jade

"Mom, I'm feeling dizzy!" Ivy whispered urgently, clutching the edge of the kitchen counter for support. Her knees wobbled as though the room was spinning, and her voice cracked with tension.

"Keep it down, Ivy! Do you want to wake the whole neighborhood?" Clara Smith replied, her tone sharp despite the concern in her eyes. She glanced toward the back door, wary of anyone overhearing.

Ivy winced, swallowing her frustration. She nodded, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Sorry, Mom."

"Are you sure about this, Clara? Once we go through with it, there's no turning back," a voice came from outside the back door. Mrs. Johnson, accompanied by a few neighbors, waited in the shadows to help Clara and Ivy execute their plan.

Clara’s gaze hardened as she turned to face the group. "Trust me, I’m sure," she said firmly, her nod signaling confidence.

Mrs. Johnson frowned, her unease clear. "Alright then," she muttered, handing Ivy a thick envelope. "The lady said you can keep the previous payment. This time, it’s a hundred dollars."

Ivy’s eyes widened as she took the envelope, the crisp bills inside feeling almost unreal. "Wow, that’s generous! Thank the lady for me," she exclaimed, unable to hide her excitement.

"Don’t get too comfortable," Mrs. Johnson warned. "The lady doesn’t want any trouble—or gossip—reaching the wrong ears."

Clara waved off the warning. "There won’t be any trouble," she reassured her. "I’ve got everything under control."

After the neighbors left, Ivy turned to Clara, her voice bubbling with excitement. "Mom, you’re amazing! We scored a hundred bucks so easily!"

Clara allowed herself a small smile, handing Ivy a few coins from her pocket. "You did good, kid," she said, tousling Ivy’s hair.

Ivy clutched the coins, a mix of gratitude and frustration brewing inside her. On the surface, it seemed like a victory, but part of her couldn’t shake off the gnawing feeling that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

In the dimly lit room, Clara’s friends stirred nervously. The air was thick with tension as they exchanged uneasy glances. Grace broke the silence. "What’s the next step? Are we really going through with this?"

Clara didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she exchanged a knowing look with Kate. Despite the fear gnawing at her, Clara’s resolve remained firm. "We stick to the plan," she said quietly. "I just hope Ethan got the message in time."

Kate nodded, but Grace’s anxiety was evident. "And if he didn’t?" she whispered.

"Then we pray for a miracle," Clara admitted. Her voice betrayed a flicker of doubt, but she quickly composed herself. She couldn’t afford to falter now—not when so much was at stake.

After what felt like an eternity, the sound of tires crunching on gravel signaled the arrival of their ride. Clara’s heart leaped in her chest. Could this be Ethan? Could he have sent someone to help them?

Her hope quickly faded when Mrs. Johnson’s voice barked orders to load the girls onto the van. Clara’s mind raced as she and her friends were ushered inside. They didn’t resist, instead feigning compliance to avoid suspicion.

Inside the van, Clara heard Mrs. Johnson muttering. "Girls, don’t hold this against me. It was your grandmother’s decision to sell you. I’m just following orders."

Clara felt a surge of anger but bit her tongue. She knew better than to reveal her hand too early.

The van rumbled along dark, winding roads. Suddenly, it came to a halt at a checkpoint. Clara’s pulse quickened as she heard an officer’s voice outside.

"Good evening, ma’am. What’s your business at this hour?"

"Officer, I’m from the Johnson family," Mrs. Johnson replied smoothly. "We had some delays on the road, but we’re on official family business."

The officer shone a flashlight inside the van, his gaze briefly lingering on the girls before nodding. "Understood. You can proceed."

Clara’s heart sank. If Ethan was going to save them, this would’ve been the perfect moment.

"Hold on!" a commanding voice called out, shattering the tension.

"Ma’am, it’s Ethan," someone whispered urgently to Mrs. Johnson.

Mrs. Johnson’s expression tightened. Of all the people they could’ve run into, why did it have to be him?

Ethan approached the van, his posture radiating confidence. Even in the dim light, his sharp features and piercing gaze were impossible to miss. "Out for a late-night drive, Mrs. Johnson?" he asked, his tone laced with teasing, though his eyes were anything but playful.

"Ethan," Mrs. Johnson greeted him stiffly. "It’s nothing serious. The lady was feeling unwell, so I came out to fetch medicine. We’re on our way back now."

Ethan arched an eyebrow, circling the van thoughtfully. His sharp instincts told him something was off. Without warning, he pulled back the curtain covering the van’s window.

"Mrs. Johnson," he said slowly, his tone turning icy. "Are these girls your ‘medicine’?"

Mrs. Johnson flinched but quickly regained her composure. Years of experience had taught her how to keep her cool, but Ethan wasn’t one to back down.

"I know what’s going on here," Ethan said, his voice low but firm. "And I won’t allow it. These girls are coming with me."

Mrs. Johnson opened her mouth to protest, but Ethan cut her off. "No excuses. If you don’t let them go, I’ll make sure the entire town hears about this. Your lady wouldn’t want that, would she?"

Mrs. Johnson hesitated, weighing her options. Finally, with a frustrated sigh, she nodded. "Fine," she relented. "Take them."

Ethan stepped aside, motioning for the girls to exit the van. Clara and her friends remained still, their breaths shallow as they maintained their act. 

"Tell your lady," Ethan continued, his voice laced with warning, "that I’ll ensure these girls are safe. If anything happens to them, she’ll have to answer to me."

As they stepped out of the van, Clara allowed herself a brief moment of relief. Ethan had saved them—at least for now.

But her gratitude was short-lived. Ethan’s sharp gaze fell on her, his expression a mix of suspicion and curiosity. "You’re not asleep," he said, his tone accusatory.

Clara froze, realizing their ruse was up. She opened her eyes fully, her mind racing for an explanation. "Thank you, Ethan," she said quickly, her voice trembling with sincerity. "I promise I can help Mr. Smith."

Ethan’s eyes narrowed. "What do you know about medicine? You’re just a small-town girl."

"I know enough!" Clara insisted, her voice rising with determination. "Just give me a chance."

Ethan studied her for a moment, then sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Fine. You got your rescue. But don’t push your luck."

Clara felt a mix of triumph and frustration. She had more to prove, but for now, she was just grateful to be safe.
