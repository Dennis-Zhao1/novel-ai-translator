**A Debt of Gratitude**

“What’s this?” Mrs. Smith asked, eyeing the herb in Ivy’s hand, her expression curious yet cautious.

“It’s an herb called Fo-Ti, Mom. Can you ask Mr. Johnson if we could borrow his truck? I need to head into town,” Ivy replied, glancing at the horizon to gauge the time. It wasn’t too late yet.

With the money she would make, they could finally sell the homemade candy and roasted chestnuts the next day. Ivy had a strong appreciation for money from her past experiences, and not having any cash on hand felt incredibly uncomfortable.

Mrs. Smith sensed a growing distance between herself and her children. Except for Emily, both Alice and Sarah were no longer as close to her as before, which made her heart ache.

Ethan, without hesitation, grabbed Ivy’s hand and led her towards the most reputable clinic in town.

**Greenwood Clinic.**

Although it was already past mid-afternoon, the clinic was bustling with patients. A young assistant was deftly sorting through various herbs.

Dr. Harris, who had just finished examining a patient, glanced toward the door while handing a prescription to the assistant. What he saw caught him off guard.

A frail girl was standing there, a large bundle slung over her shoulder, her eyes darting around like she was a bandit descending from the mountains.

But upon closer inspection, he realized that the bundle was actually Fo-Ti!

“Hold on a second, everyone!” Dr. Harris called out to the patients in front of him.

Ivy stood at the entrance, scanning the busy clinic. She had no idea whom to approach to sell her herbs and was just about to leave when—

“Miss, please wait!” Dr. Harris shouted, disregarding his image as he rushed toward her.

Ivy turned, puzzled, unsure if he was calling her.

Dr. Harris had already reached her side, his demeanor warm and inviting. “You’re here to sell herbs, aren’t you?”

Ivy nodded, recognizing him as the doctor who had just treated a patient. He seemed capable and trustworthy.

“Please, come inside,” Dr. Harris said politely.

“After you,” Ivy replied, feeling a sense of respect for doctors like him.

Dr. Harris led Ivy into the clinic’s backyard. Ethan was waiting by the truck at the entrance. Seeing Ivy being welcomed inside, he felt reassured; the doctors at Greenwood Clinic were all kind-hearted.

He couldn’t help but wonder how precious Ivy’s Fo-Ti really was that Dr. Harris himself had come out to greet her and invite her to the backyard. Usually, when someone came to sell herbs, they would simply call the assistant over to weigh them.

Ivy emerged from the clinic with a beaming smile, her hands now holding over fifty dollars.

“Should we head straight home?” Ethan asked.

“Let’s buy some wrapping paper, weigh out a few pounds of sugar, and pick up some meat before heading back,” Ivy replied.

On their way, Ivy noticed a bookstore and asked Ethan to stop the truck.

“What do you need from the bookstore?” Ethan queried, his brow furrowed in confusion.

Ivy smiled but said nothing. She had been pondering how to repay Mrs. Brown and Ethan for their kindness, and the sight of the bookstore sparked an idea.

Ethan had only one son, Mark, who studied in town and had a day off every week, though he might get extra time off during busy farming seasons. Since Mark was a diligent student, Ivy decided to buy him a stack of paper and a set of pens as a way to express her gratitude.

After purchasing the other items, Ivy returned to the butcher who had sold her pork the previous day. This time, she bought a larger quantity, and the owner graciously gifted her a pig’s foot. Ivy couldn’t help but compliment the butcher, making him beam with joy, and he even tossed in a couple of bones for her.

When Ivy got home, Mrs. Brown brought over some fresh vegetables. Ivy asked Ethan to wait for her so they could return the truck to Mr. Johnson’s house together. She had intentionally brought along about two pounds of meat as a token of appreciation.

By now, thanks to Susan’s chatter, word had spread throughout the neighborhood that Ivy’s family had found a way to sell herbs for money. Neighbors they encountered on the road would ask her questions.

Ivy openly acknowledged the gossip, which helped assuage any concerns about their sudden wealth. After all, her family was all women, and it would be easy for rumors to fly if they suddenly had money to spend.

“Take the meat back. We’re all from the same town,” Mrs. Johnson, the town chief’s daughter-in-law, insisted.

“Mrs. Johnson, this isn’t just a thank-you for the truck. It’s also for the town chief’s hard work helping us with the land contract. Please accept it,” Ivy insisted firmly.

“Let’s talk about something else, shall we?” Ivy said, placing the meat on the counter and changing the subject.

“What is it? Just say it,” Mrs. Johnson encouraged.

“My sisters and I want to prepare two types of food and need to go to town or the county to buy supplies. We’d like to rent the truck for that. Would thirty dollars a day be okay?” Ivy proposed.

“That works, but let’s lower it to twenty dollars. We still have another truck for plowing, so it’s more than enough,” Mrs. Johnson agreed.

“Thank you so much, Mrs. Johnson! You’re too kind. Don’t worry; we’ll treat the truck well and make sure it’s well-maintained before returning it,” Ivy replied happily, sealing the deal before stepping outside to find Ethan still waiting by the door.

“Mr. Brown, why didn’t you leave first?” she asked.

“No rush; it hasn’t been long,” Ethan replied casually. Ivy had already informed Mrs. Brown and Ethan that they would be having dinner at her place that evening.

After dinner, Ivy brought out the gifts for Mrs. Brown’s family: a pound of sugar, two pounds of pork, and the supplies for Mark.

“I can’t accept this. You and your mom are like family to me,” Mrs. Brown protested.

“I know Aunt Brown’s heart. To me, you’re like family, and that’s why you should accept this. I sold some herbs today and wanted to honor you with this. If you refuse, it would feel like we’re growing distant,” Ivy explained earnestly.

“See? I told you that Sarah has changed a lot. She never used to have such a sharp tongue,” Mrs. Brown remarked, glancing at Mrs. Smith and Ethan.

Amy and Lily sat in a corner, hoping not to be the next subjects of discussion.

But as fate would have it, Mrs. Brown’s gaze landed on them, and she said, “Lynne, I have to say, all three children have changed a great deal since the events of the past few days. Alice was always the most outgoing, and Sarah the shyest, but now it seems they’ve switched roles. And Emily, who used to avoid you, now clings to you.”

Mrs. Smith’s heart sank deeper as she looked over her children, feeling guilty for their struggles.

“It’s all my fault as their mother; they’ve had to endure so much because of me, and that’s why they’ve changed,” she lamented.

“I told you to move out sooner. But at least now that you’ve moved, things are looking up. Just look at how lucky you’ve been since leaving. Sarah even found that precious herb!”

“Yes, things are definitely better now,” Mrs. Smith smiled, but Ivy sensed a lingering sadness in her mother’s brow.

Mrs. Brown, aware of Mrs. Smith’s pain, scolded herself for bringing up sensitive topics. She turned and affectionately ruffled Ivy’s hair.

“Well, since it’s the children’s way of showing respect, I’ll accept it,” she finally conceded.

With that, she followed Ethan out, muttering to herself about how she shouldn’t have mentioned those things earlier.
