**Evening Gathering**

“Hey, turns out it was just a mix-up! I always knew Mrs. Smith had a big heart; she would never say something like that,” one of the girls exclaimed.

“Wow, Mrs. Smith is really generous! She bought gifts for everyone and even handed out money!” another girl added.

“Exactly! Her kindness is absolutely genuine,” a third girl chimed in.

Clara Joy accepted the money with a smile, not at all bothered by the fact that Mrs. Smith’s reputation had improved. After all, it wasn’t her who felt wronged.

“Thank you, Mrs. Smith! Take care!” Clara Joy called after her as Mrs. Smith hurried away. Once she was out of sight, Clara Joy angrily shoved away the old housekeeper's hand.

“What were you thinking, saying I wanted to buy them things? There are so many ways to handle this; why did you pick the worst one?” Mrs. Smith snapped.

The housekeeper immediately looked down, ashamed. “I wasn’t thinking straight! I just wanted to protect your reputation, and I spoke without thinking. I deserve to be punished.”

Mrs. Smith looked at the trembling housekeeper, a flicker of fear crossing her mind that someone might overhear. “Fine, I’ll let it go this time since you were thinking of me. Just be more careful next time. Those two girls are getting an undeserved advantage.”

Clara Joy jingled the silver coins in her hand, pondering if this was just luck. On the way back, Clara Joy’s sister, Sarah, watched her giggling.

“Hahaha, the look on Mrs. Smith’s face was just too funny! She never expected it would actually benefit us in the end!” Sarah laughed.

“Yeah, it was hilarious! But you don’t have to keep grinning like that!” Sarah said, rolling her eyes.

“Oh come on, I’m just in a good mood!” Clara Joy replied cheerfully.

Julie, having heard the news, couldn’t stop herself from laughing either. However, when she spotted Mrs. Williams sitting alone and looking forlorn by the fireplace, she felt compelled to share the news.

Clara Joy and Sarah didn’t stop her. Julie, having grown up without her parents, had come to see Mrs. Williams as a mother figure. It was quite an achievement for her to have held on for this long.

“Third Sister was right to do so,” Mrs. Williams said, gripping Julie’s hand tightly, then turned to Clara Joy.

However, Clara Joy didn’t respond; she still felt a knot in her heart. Mrs. Williams had truly come to terms with things recently. The last time Clara returned home, her mother had relentlessly mocked and scorned her, making her realize she was no longer their child.

Now she only had her daughters, but she understood that they wouldn’t easily believe her again. However, if she just held her ground and didn’t make mistakes, she would eventually regain their trust. At least, after all this time, Second Sister was willing to talk to her again.

“Detecting unfavorable factors,” a voice suddenly echoed in Clara Joy’s mind, causing her to snap her eyes open.

“What’s happening?” she asked.

“I don’t know either. The system detected something, but don’t worry; there’s nothing nearby that can harm you,” the system, named Ava, replied, sounding puzzled.

Clara Joy couldn't trust the system entirely. She gently shook Sarah awake, and together they circled the house, but found nothing amiss.

“Don’t worry, it’s probably just a system error,” Sarah reassured her.

Yet Clara Joy still felt uneasy.

In the woods behind the Williams family, Carol was conversing with a group of men in black clothing.

“Let me tell you, those three girls are doing better and better; they’ve already moved out of my house, and I can’t control them anymore,” she said.

“The lady gave you so much money, not for you to make their lives difficult. How could they leave?” one of the men questioned.

“I…I…” Carol stammered, unable to respond.

“Never mind, useless peasant. I will report back to my lady myself,” the man said dismissively.

“But I can still keep an eye on them and pass on messages,” Carol protested.

“Don’t let them have it easy. Find a way to make trouble for them.”

“Uh, those girls seem to have changed completely; they’re crafty and resourceful,” Carol replied, feeling frustrated.

If she had any clever ideas, she wouldn’t even need to bother with them; that way, she wouldn’t be looked down upon!

“You’re useless then. You won’t be getting any money this time,” the man in black said coldly before disappearing in an instant.

Carol muttered a few curses under her breath as she cautiously made her way out of the woods.

“The system doesn’t make mistakes; this unfavorable factor will bring trouble in the future,” Ava’s mechanical voice rang in her ears.

Who could be plotting against them? Clara Joy mentally went through the list of people she’d offended. Could it be Mrs. Smith? But why would she be scheming at this hour?

Forget it, Clara Joy shook her head. If it’s about the future, then let it be; for now, just focus on living well in the present.

“Let’s sleep. It’s only a matter for the future,” Clara Joy said, patting Sarah.

“Where did you go?” Mr. Williams suddenly asked when Carol returned.

“I…I just went to the restroom,” she replied.

“You were gone for nearly half an hour! You just went to the restroom?” Mr. Williams sounded skeptical.

Carol felt the weight of his suspicious gaze and remembered there were no more free funds. Anger flared within her.

“Are you accusing me of being unfaithful? You old man! I, Carol, have served you diligently for almost my entire life, and you dare to doubt me?”

Mr. Williams wasn’t the kind of person to self-reflect either.

“Then where did you really go?” he pressed.

This was a matter she couldn’t divulge, and Carol’s eyes darted around nervously.

After being together for so long, Mr. Williams could tell something was off. He remembered how there always seemed to be more money at home lately and that she had sneaked out in the middle of the night without explaining herself.

“Slap!” Mr. Williams struck Carol hard across the face.

Carol refused to admit to anything she hadn’t done, leading to a fierce argument that escalated quickly.

The commotion woke up everyone in the Williams household, who were clueless as to what the old couple was fighting about at such an hour.

The next day, when Clara Joy returned from town, she bumped into John, who was selling apples and chestnuts.

“Hey, did you hear? Last night, Mr. Williams and Carol got into another big fight. Apparently, Carol sneaked out last night to meet someone!”

Carol was out last night? Clara Joy exchanged a glance with Sarah.

Could Carol be plotting against them? But who was she meeting? Was she trying to get someone to harm them?

Clara Joy couldn’t figure it out, but she felt that since they were only running a food business, the best way to sabotage them would be through their food supplies.

It seemed that they would need to be more cautious about food matters going forward.

“Ding! You’ve received a dessert recipe reward.”

Clara Joy snapped back to reality. She hurried to her room to accept the reward.

She had been worried about how to sell the remaining apples and chestnuts, and now the system had provided her a great opportunity, reminding her that Thanksgiving was just around the corner.

However, in terms of food preparation, she and Sarah would only have the role of helpers for Julie.

When Mrs. Williams wasn’t paying attention, Clara Joy secretly passed the dessert recipe to Julie. The next day, after selling off the chestnuts and apples, they went to the blacksmith’s shop to order a large flat iron pot with a lid.

Three days before Thanksgiving, Clara Joy’s family stopped selling apples and chestnuts. She went back to town to pick up the pot and bought the ingredients Julie needed for making desserts.

Julie took charge of making the filling and dough, while Clara Joy and Sarah focused on wrapping the desserts. As for Mrs. Williams, Julie thought it was best for her to keep an eye on the fire for baking the desserts.

Without an oven, they placed the large flat iron pot on the fire Mrs. Williams had prepared, putting the desserts inside before covering it up. They then placed burning charcoal on top of the lid.

The large iron pot Clara Joy ordered had a diameter of three feet and could hold around a hundred desserts at once.
