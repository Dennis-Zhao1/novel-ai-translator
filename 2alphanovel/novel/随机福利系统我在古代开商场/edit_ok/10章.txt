**Achieving the Objective**

"First off, my dad left some money when he passed, enough for my sisters and me to live comfortably for a while," Ethan Jade said firmly, making sure everyone in the room heard him clearly.

"Secondly, you sold all the jewelry Dad bought for Mom. Even conservatively, I'd say it was worth a small fortune—enough to sustain a family for years."

"Thirdly, since we've been here, we've worked ourselves to the bone—up before dawn, asleep after everyone else. We've been yelled at, and going hungry is just part of the routine."

Ethan paused, noticing the deepening frown on Mr. Smith's face before continuing, "When you add it all up, it seems like you and Grandpa have taken quite a hefty advantage of us."

"Bah! What advantage have we taken?" Mrs. Smith scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "John, can you just sit there and watch your daughter accuse your parents? Oh, I really regret raising you!" she exclaimed, her eyes darting toward John as if seeking support.

John, supported by Claire and Lily, sensed his daughter's worry and gently patted her hand. "Mom, if you want to make a scene, go ahead. You know in your heart whether what Ethan said is true, and it would be just right for the neighbors to weigh in."

Seeing John's resolve, Ethan felt more assured and decided not to waste any more breath. "We want to move out, and you need to give us the money Dad left. After that, we'll be on our own."

"No way! You think you can just walk out and ask for money? And besides, if you move out, who’s going to do the work around here?" Mrs. Smith exploded, her face flushed with anger.

"If not, we’ll invite everyone to hear the truth. Not to mention the money my father left behind, just the fact that you sold us off to the Thompson family—if that gets out, even if you deny it, the neighbors will talk. Don’t you think the Thompsons will blame you for ruining their reputation?" Ethan challenged, his voice steady.

"How dare you!" Mrs. Smith shouted, pointing an accusatory finger at Ethan.

Mr. Smith’s face darkened further, silence enveloping him as he contemplated the situation.

Ethan decided it was time to play her trump card. "What if this leads to the Thompsons retaliating and ruining my cousin’s schooling, or even…”

"You move out, and I’ll give you the money. Just get out of here right now, and we’ll sever all ties!" Mr. Smith finally snapped, his voice cold and commanding.

Sever ties? Ethan couldn’t help but relish the thought. She feared these people would come back later, using their past kindness as leverage to entangle them further.

"Alright, just to prevent any troubles in the future if we run out of money and come back begging, Grandpa, don’t you think we should have the community leader come over to draft a written agreement?" Ethan suggested with a seemingly innocent expression.

Mr. Smith eyed Ethan suspiciously, her demeanor strikingly different from before, but he still doubted whether a single woman could survive with three young girls, even with the money he provided.

"Alex, go fetch the community leader," he ordered.

"Father, what will they do for a living if the youngest sisters leave?" Alex interjected, concerned.

"Brother, they’re the ones insisting on leaving; I didn’t force them out," John replied, clarity in his tone.

"Ethan, quickly tell your grandfather that you were just joking before! Little sister, you too—how could you let Ethan say such things?" Alex looked between Ethan and John, disapproval written all over his face.

In her memories, Ethan recalled that among the elders, her uncle had been decent, but unfortunately, he was under his wife’s thumb.

Seeing her husband’s sour expression, Mary tugged at his sleeve urgently. "Just go, stop wasting time."

"Brother, please go find the community leader. It’s our decision to leave," John insisted.

With no other choice, Alex reluctantly complied.

Before long, the community leader was summoned. Mr. Smith, without saying much, simply stated that the sisters were to move out, offering them the money, and that they would have no further ties.

"Grandfather, why not add a clause about severing ties with my mother? After all, regardless of how we separate, she’s still your daughter. If it comes down to a crisis, you must help her, right?" Ethan pressed.

"Add it. You can’t expect to come here again. Don’t ever set foot in my house again!" Mrs. Smith interjected angrily.

John opened his mouth, ready to argue against that clause, but Mrs. Smith’s words drowned him out.

"Then let’s have the community leader add that clause," Ethan said.

John felt his heart sink, tears trembling on the brink of falling.

Ethan quickly glanced at Claire and Lily, who tightened their grips, understanding her intention. If John fell to the ground crying, it would be such an embarrassment and a blow to their morale.

The community leader disapproved; he knew how difficult it must be for a woman to raise three young girls alone. But seeing that both sides agreed, he felt powerless to intervene.

After the relevant agreement was established, Mr. Smith directed Mrs. Smith to hand over the money to John.

"Now, just get out of my sight. It’s as if I never had you as my daughter," he said coldly.

Following the community leader, Claire and Lily practically supported John as they stepped out. Once outside, the community leader paused and looked at them with sympathy.

"Community leader, please don’t think we’re pitiful. We’re so happy to leave this house; at least we don’t have to worry about being betrayed," Lily said cheerfully.

The community leader grasped the meaning behind her words, finally understanding why they were so eager to leave the Smith family.

As Ethan patted Lily, the community leader said gently, "Don’t worry; I won’t say a word."

"Where will you stay now?" the community leader asked next.

Ethan was suddenly at a loss for words; she had completely overlooked that detail. She had assumed Mr. Smith would take his time returning, and that Mrs. Smith wouldn’t be able to make such a quick decision to kick them out.

"Community leader, I remember there’s a small cottage at the end of the neighborhood. Could we rent it for a while?" Claire suddenly suggested.

The community leader slapped his forehead. "Right! How could I forget about that place? No need to rent; I’ll let you stay there for free for two months. Although it belongs to the community, everyone around here is family, and I’m sure they’ll be more than willing to help. But we can’t let you stay for free forever."

Ethan felt relieved; she understood the reasoning behind only offering them two months of free rent. After all, everyone needed to contribute to community expenses, and if they overstayed without paying, there would certainly be complaints.

"We don’t want to stay for free; we’ll pay rent," Claire insisted.

Ethan nodded in agreement, wanting to avoid any potential troubles.

"If you insist, then pay what you owe," the community leader replied.

"Can you let my mother go over to rest while we head to town to buy supplies? We’ll come back in the afternoon to sign the contract with you," Ethan suggested, mainly concerned that the community leader wouldn’t have any small change on hand.

They truly needed to go to town to buy essentials since Mrs. Smith didn’t allow them to take anything with them.

They were genuinely leaving with nothing!
