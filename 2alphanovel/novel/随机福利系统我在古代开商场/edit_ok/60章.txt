Ethan Jade kept his excitement in check as he and Clara Joy strolled through the quaint fishing village. The air was filled with the warm greetings from familiar faces, each one offering a friendly smile.

"Ethan, you're here!" a joyful voice called out.

"The boss has arrived!" another chimed in.

"How's everyone doing?" Ethan replied warmly, engaging with the villagers.

"Pretty good! Thanks to your help, things are looking up for us," a cheerful villager responded.

A woman with a radiant smile approached, sharing, "My daughter-in-law just had a big, healthy baby boy a couple of days ago!"

"Congratulations, Mrs. Smith!" Ethan grinned, genuinely delighted.

"It's thanks to you, Ethan. Without your support, we couldn't have afforded this. In the past, selling goods to the Johnson family, we could barely buy meat," she said, gratitude evident in her voice.

"That's all behind us now. Things will only improve from here," Ethan assured her, his confidence unwavering.

As they walked, villagers continued to greet Ethan, and he reciprocated each one with genuine interest.

"Ethan, you're back!"

"Mr. Anderson!" Ethan exclaimed, spotting the village elder and rushing forward to assist him.

"Why did you come out yourself? Are you feeling better?" Ethan asked, concern in his voice.

"Thanks to the herbs you sent, I've been recovering well," the elder replied, a thankful smile on his face.

"That's wonderful to hear! Please take care," Ethan urged.

"Some villagers went fishing yesterday and caught quite a haul. Since you're here, come by my place and sample some!" the elder invited, grinning.

"Absolutely!" Ethan agreed readily.

"Are these your friends? They should come too," the elder continued, gesturing for Clara Joy and her companions to join in.

"Clara, how about this? I'll help the elder home, and you can explore a bit. Join us when you're ready," Ethan suggested.

"Sounds perfect," Clara replied, her smile warm and inviting.

As Clara Joy and her friend strolled through the village, they watched the villagers sorting their catch by the shore, while others came to collect their goods.

"This Smith family seems wonderful. What do you think, Emily?" Clara asked, her curiosity piqued.

"The happiness on their faces seems genuine. Ethan Jade seems like a truly good person," Emily responded thoughtfully.

Clara noticed a group of children playing nearby and approached them, asking Emily for some snacks to share.

"Who are you looking for?" one of the children asked, tilting his head curiously.

"I just have a few questions," Clara said with a gentle smile.

"Sure, ask away!" an older child replied eagerly.

"Do you know about the Smith family?" Clara inquired.

"Of course! My mom says they're our saviors!" the child responded animatedly.

"We can eat meat regularly now, all thanks to them. They even bring us clothes and candy sometimes," another child added.

"Wait, you're not from the Johnson family, are you?" the older boy asked suspiciously.

"No, we're friends of the Smith family, just visiting," Clara reassured them.

"Oh, so you're friends with them! Then you must be good people too," the boy concluded after a moment's thought.

"Did the Johnson family ever cause trouble afterward?" Emily asked, intrigued.

"They did, but the Smith family helped us handle them," the boy responded confidently.

"The Smith family is amazing! They never lower their prices, and they always pay us right away," another child added.

After chatting with the children, Clara felt she had a deeper understanding of the Smith family's impact. They continued their walk and eventually asked a villager for directions to the elder's house.

"You're back! Please, have a seat!" the elder welcomed them warmly, calling for his daughter-in-law to bring over some stools.

"Make yourselves at home; don't be shy," he said, sensing their potential discomfort.

"Thank you, Mr. Anderson," Clara replied graciously.

"No need to thank us! You're friends of Ethan, which makes you good people," the elder insisted, his eyes twinkling with sincerity.

"Ethan, you're here!" a cheerful voice called out.

"Sarah, you're back! Did school let out early today?" Ethan asked, his expression brightening.

"Yeah, we have a day off," Sarah replied with a smile.

"How's school?" Ethan asked, genuinely curious.

"My teacher praised me today, saying I'm making great progress!" she beamed.

"Thank you for helping Sarah attend the academy," the elder's daughter-in-law said, stepping forward to gently pat Sarah's head.

"Aunt, there's no need to keep saying that," Sarah said, slightly embarrassed.

"I'll always be grateful. You built the village school, and now Sarah is attending the academy. I'll remember your kindness forever," she added, glancing at Clara and the others.

Clara's thoughts raced. This aunt must have realized they were considering working with the Smith family. She intentionally highlighted their contributions to the village.

But Clara also felt a deep appreciation for Ethan Jade's integrity. How could she not trust someone like him for collaboration?

At noon, Clara and her friends enjoyed a light seafood feast at the elder's home. The dishes showcased the fresh flavors of the ocean.

After the meal, Ethan prepared to leave with Clara. The elder, ignoring Ethan's protests, insisted on accompanying them to the boat.

"Wahhhh—Mom!" a voice cried from a nearby house.

"Don't cry, dear. It breaks my heart to see you like this," a woman's voice trembled with emotion.

"I don't want to marry; I don't want to be a concubine! I just want to stay home and help you, please!" the girl pleaded desperately.

"Child, I have no choice! That horrible man has set his sights on you!" the mother lamented.

"Why must my fate be so cruel!" the girl cried, her voice filled with despair.

As they passed a home, Clara and the elder paused, drawn to the sounds of distress. The day had been filled with joy, but now, hearing the cries from this household piqued their curiosity.

"Ah, daughter, please don't do anything rash!" the mother sobbed.

Hearing the commotion, Ethan immediately rushed inside, followed closely by his attendants.

"Ethan, what’s happening here?" Clara asked, concern etched on her face.

The elder led Clara and the others inside, where they saw Ethan's attendant holding a girl tightly.

"Mr. Anderson, you're here too," the older woman said, her face streaked with tears.

"What happened? What's going on in this house?" the elder asked, looking around in alarm.
