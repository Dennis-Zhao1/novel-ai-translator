**Chapter: White Cliff Temple**

Clara Joy led her younger brother, Ethan Jade, down the narrow street in the southern part of the city. As they reached the end, it was exactly as she'd imagined—quiet and overgrown with weeds.

"Ethan!" Clara called, her voice breaking through the silence. She turned to see her brother pointing at something in the distance.

Ethan grinned, looking up at her. "Look, it's like a secret garden!" he exclaimed with childlike wonder.

Clara chuckled, feeling a warmth spread through her heart despite the desolate surroundings. "You're right. Maybe we can bring it back to life someday," she said, taking Ethan's hand.

Ethan sensed Clara's happiness and felt a sense of joy himself. They headed home, their spirits lifted by shared dreams.

“Mrs. Smith, we’re back!” Clara announced as they entered their home. Not long after, Mr. Harris came to visit.

Clara had thought he might bring Mrs. Green, but to her surprise, it was Mr. Harris's grandfather who accompanied him.

“Grandpa Harris, you made it! Please, have a seat,” Clara said warmly, gesturing to the cozy living room.

“No need for formalities. I just wanted to see how you two were doing. It’s been too long since you visited us,” the old man replied with a kind smile.

Mrs. Smith, Clara’s caretaker, quickly set out some coffee.

“I heard from Mr. Harris you're planning to open a mall,” the elder continued, sipping his coffee.

“Yes, Grandpa Harris,” Clara said, her demeanor respectful yet relaxed.

“Five stories is quite ambitious. Have you considered that not all builders might handle that?” he asked thoughtfully.

“I’m working on it. I want it to be a one-stop mall where people can find everything they need, with spaces to relax,” Clara explained, her determination evident.

“I know someone who used to be the best builder around, but he's retired now. If you can convince him, you'll be in good hands,” Grandpa Harris suggested, his eyes twinkling.

“Do you know where I can find him?” Clara asked eagerly.

“Behind the White Cliff Temple. But he's a bit of an oddball, so it won't be easy,” the elder warned with a smile.

“Does he have any interests? It might help me approach him,” Clara inquired, her mind racing.

“He loves good wine, but only the finest will catch his attention,” Grandpa Harris replied knowingly.

Clara nodded, grateful for the advice. “Thank you, Grandpa Harris. Your support means the world to me.”

“You’re like a granddaughter to me,” he chuckled.

“Grandpa Harris, you’re definitely my grandpa now,” Clara joked lightly.

“Wait a second! Aren't you mixing things up?” Mr. Harris chimed in, feigning disapproval.

“Let me worry about my family tree!” the elder Harris laughed, his voice full of warmth.

That evening, Clara invited Grandpa Harris and Mr. Harris to stay for dinner. They ventured out to buy fresh ingredients, and Ethan eagerly eyed the groceries, his anticipation clear.

“Patience, Ethan. We’ll cook a feast,” Clara said, teasing him gently.

Ethan nodded, his excitement palpable as they headed back.

Back home, Clara prepared a hot pot with a base Mrs. Smith had made.

“This is delicious! Mrs. Smith, we need more of this in the future,” Clara exclaimed, savoring the flavors.

Hearing this, Grandpa Harris gave her a playful look. Their mix-up was all in good fun.

“This meal is truly delightful,” Grandpa Harris remarked, clearly impressed.

After a joyful evening, Clara saw off Grandpa Harris and Mr. Harris, allowing Ethan to finish his meal in peace.

Once the dishes were cleared, Clara and Mrs. Smith continued to teach Ethan new words, filling the room with laughter.

The next day, Clara visited the liquor store to buy a jar of the finest wine she could find. Back home, she set up a makeshift distillation apparatus, refining the wine to perfection.

The rich aroma filled the air, and Clara knew she had succeeded. She carefully poured the wine into a beautiful ceramic jar, hoping it would persuade the retired builder to help her with the mall.

Though she had considered hiring other builders, Clara understood the importance of quality and safety, especially with so many people expected to visit.

She asked Mr. Harris and his friend not to drop by the next day, planning to take Ethan up the mountain herself.

As they prepared to leave, Clara rented a car for the journey, knowing they'd need it to reach the White Cliff Temple.

Once they arrived at the foot of the temple, Clara looked up at the steep steps, feeling a mix of anticipation and doubt. How long would it take to climb to the top?

Seeing the determined expressions of those around her, Clara felt as if the stairs were testing her sincerity.

Even though she was fit, the climb left Clara winded halfway up.

“Ethan, hold up! Wait for me!” Clara called out, watching her brother effortlessly ascend the stairs.

Ethan paused, stepping back to help Clara up, encouraging her to keep moving.

Together, they climbed the remaining steps, Ethan pulling Clara along as they finally reached the top.

Standing at the summit, Clara felt a wave of dizziness, but also a sense of accomplishment.

She found a secluded spot to hide the wine, then purchased some incense at the temple.

With reverence, Clara prayed at each statue, not sure if she believed in these traditions but feeling that a little sincerity couldn't hurt.

After her prayers, Clara intended to take the small path next to the temple to find the craftsman, but a young monk stopped her.

“Please wait, Miss,” he said respectfully.

“There’s an eccentric master living above. If you go up, you might disturb him, so I ask you to reconsider,” the monk advised.

Clara nodded. “I came to see him specifically.”

“Then I won’t stop you,” the monk said, stepping aside to let her pass.
