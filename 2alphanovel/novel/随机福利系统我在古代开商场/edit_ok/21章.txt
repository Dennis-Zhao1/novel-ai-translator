**Fancy Mooncake Sales**

The next morning, the family gathered for breakfast, exchanging laughter and stories over pancakes and scrambled eggs. Then it was back to the hustle of making mooncakes. By evening, their muscles ached, protesting every movement.

Seeing this, Mrs. Smith couldn't help but feel a wave of sympathy. Ignoring the aloofness from Ivy and Clara, she took turns massaging their shoulders.

“You both work so hard. It really tugs at my heart,” she said gently.

“We're determined to become the most successful family around here,” Clara finally responded, a hint of ambition in her voice.

Mrs. Smith blinked, surprised and moved. “Hearing you talk to me, Ivy, is more than I hoped for. I realize I might have been wrong before,” she admitted, her voice wavering with emotion.

“Hmm, we'll see,” Clara replied, her tone still cool but with a glimmer of warmth.

As for Ivy, who had remained silent, Mrs. Smith decided not to push her. It was a journey, after all.

The following day, Clara and Ivy asked Liam for help with the truck to head to the county fair for their stall. This time, they brought along a thousand mooncakes, some individually wrapped and some in beautiful gift boxes.

With the Fall Festival tomorrow, the county was bustling today, as schools had closed early for the holiday.

“Step right up! Solve the riddle and win a mooncake!” 

“Looking for mooncakes? Our stall has the best flavors!”

“Any aspiring poets out there? Compose a poem and the winner will receive a luxurious mooncake set!” Clara called out cheerfully.

Many passersby stopped to listen, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers.

“This sounds like fun! I must join in!” an elderly voice boomed. Although his English was a bit accented, many students perked up at the sound.

“Excuse me, are you Mr. Young?” one brave student asked, his face flushed with excitement.

Mr. Young examined the student before him. “Indeed, I am,” he replied with a nod.

At this moment, Clara and Ivy stepped forward and greeted Mr. Young with friendly smiles.

“No need for such formality. I’m just here to see your activities and perhaps scout for talent for my Westbridge Academy,” Mr. Young said casually.

Hearing this, the students around them buzzed with excitement. Westbridge Academy was the best in the county! Regardless of your background, if you had talent and passed their tests, you could enroll. Scholarships were available for those from less fortunate families.

“By the way, you’re selling mooncakes, right? I’ll buy a couple to try,” Mr. Young added.

“Mr. Young supporting us is already a huge honor! You don’t need to buy them. Ivy, wrap one of each flavor for Mr. Young,” Clara said gratefully, recognizing the gesture.

The crowd watched as Mr. Young took a mooncake, unwrapped it, and began to taste it. He had initially only wanted to help promote their stall, thinking he would say nice things as long as the flavor was decent. 

But to his surprise, these mooncakes were irresistibly delicious! He couldn't stop himself. After finishing one, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “This mooncake is unlike any I’ve ever tasted! Truly exquisite!”

“Could I try the riddle?” a student gathered his courage and asked, his face reddening.

“Of course,” Mr. Young replied.

“The first riddle is: All around are mountains, and the mountains connect to each other.”

The student repeated the riddle, thinking deeply. “Is it the character for ‘field’ (田)?”

“Correct! You win a mooncake!” Clara handed the mooncake over with a smile.

“Nine riddles remain. Do you wish to continue?” 

“Absolutely.”

The student answered five correctly in a row before he stumbled on the seventh. 

No other student dared to jump in, and even Mr. Young took a moment to ponder before he figured it out. Ultimately, it was a modestly dressed student, clean but clearly from a humble background, who managed to answer all the remaining riddles.

“Now that all the riddles have been solved, it’s time for poetry!” Clara announced.

The students gathered eagerly, each composing a poem to present to Mr. Young for judgment.

Meanwhile, the surrounding crowd, including some well-dressed young ladies out for a stroll, quickly formed around Clara’s stall. After all, even Mr. Young praised the taste!

Clara and Ivy were busier than ever, realizing they had gained the celebrity effect.

Those with money purchased luxurious boxes, while others bought regular ones, and still others chose loose mooncakes. Regardless, everyone wanted a taste of the flavor Mr. Young had endorsed.

As the poetry contest concluded, Clara had only two luxury sets left from the initial batch, while the rest had sold out.

The winner turned out to be the modestly dressed student, and Clara proudly handed him the luxurious mooncake set. Mr. Young patted his shoulder, inviting him to enroll at Westbridge Academy after the festival.

The student was ecstatic, showering Clara and Mr. Young with gratitude.

Watching him, the other students felt envy, but then they thought, even if they couldn’t join Westbridge Academy, at least they could enjoy the mooncakes that Mr. Young deemed delicious.

However, to their dismay, the mooncakes were all sold out.

Seeing the disappointed faces, Clara immediately assured them, “We’ll come back tomorrow with even more mooncakes. Everyone will have a chance to buy some!”

And with that, the crowd dispersed.

Clara picked up one of the mooncakes they had saved and approached Mr. Young. “Thank you, Grandpa Young.”

Mr. Young, who had been composed just moments ago, couldn’t contain his joy as he looked at the mooncake, his face beaming with a wide smile. 

“Then I shall accept it,” he said happily.

Clara nodded and informed him that they would only be able to come to his residence in the afternoon to help with his health.

Mr. Young gazed longingly at the mooncake in the butler’s hands, waving him off to signal he understood.

Today, Clara and her team prepared thirty luxurious mooncake boxes, selling each for thirty dollars, eighty regular mooncakes at ten dollars each, and loose ones for a dollar apiece. After deducting rewards and the ones gifted to Mr. Young, they earned a total of two hundred forty-two dollars.

Afterward, they waited for Liam to arrive before heading out to buy packaging paper and beautiful wooden boxes.

“They’re all sold out!” Clara exclaimed, laughing at the surprised expressions of Ivy and Mrs. Smith.

“That’s fantastic! That’s fantastic!” Mrs. Smith clapped her hands together excitedly.

“And tomorrow will surely sell even better,” Clara added confidently.

Upon hearing this, Ivy immediately chimed in, “Let’s make more and sell them all tomorrow.”

“Do we have enough mooncakes at home? We have about two thousand left, right? Let’s get the ones we need to package ready this afternoon. While making money is important, health is even more so!” Mrs. Smith insisted, cautious yet firm.

Clara agreed; the past couple of days, they had risen early and gone to bed late, leaving them all quite exhausted.

“Ding! You’ve earned a bottle of Spirit Water as a reward.”

Just then, Clara thought of something, and a voice echoed in her mind.

Wow, that’s quite intelligent, Clara thought, impressed.

“I’ll go get everyone some water,” she said, heading to the kitchen. Noticing Mrs. Smith hadn’t followed her, she took the opportunity to gather the water, dividing it into four portions before calling for Ivy to help her carry it over.

“What kind of water is this? It tastes sweet, and it makes you feel so much lighter after drinking it!” one of them remarked.

“Really? It’s probably just because I added some sugar,” Clara replied, brushing it off with a playful smile.
