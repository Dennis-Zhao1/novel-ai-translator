**Rescue**

Afterward, Clara Joy and Ethan Harper signed a seafood procurement agreement. Clara Joy handed over a deposit of a thousand dollars.

“I wonder if you have time tomorrow?” Ethan asked, his tone polite yet hopeful.

“Now that everything is settled, we should be heading back,” Clara Joy replied, her expression turning businesslike.

“Just make sure the goods are delivered to us on time,” she added with a hint of urgency.

“Absolutely. If you’re not in a hurry, why not stay another day or two? We could go out to the ocean with the locals from the small fishing village,” Ethan suggested, enthusiasm lighting up his eyes.

“Sounds great! I’d love to see the ocean,” Clara Joy responded, her eyes sparkling with excitement. This was an adventure she had never experienced before, and now she could finally indulge in the beauty of the sea.

“Let’s do it tomorrow then. I’ll be waiting for you at the trading house first thing in the morning,” he confirmed.

The next day, Clara Joy arrived at the trading house with her two companions, Sarah and Lily. To avoid crowding, they only brought along their trusty assistant, Ben, leaving the rest of the entourage at the inn.

“Good morning, Ethan,” the trio greeted him warmly.

They then made their way to the coast, boarding the same boat as before to reach the small fishing village.

“The boss has arrived; we’ve been waiting for you!” one of the villagers called out as they stepped onto the larger ship, which slowly drifted away from the shore.

The villagers were busy casting nets while Clara Joy and her friends stood at the bow, taking in the vastness of the ocean.

“What’s that over there?” Clara Joy pointed as she spotted a small island in the distance.

“That’s Pine Island. It’s home to quite a few families,” Ethan replied.

“It looks so small from here. Can so many people really live there?” Sarah asked with curiosity.

“In reality, it’s about the size of a small town,” he explained.

“Do they also rely on seafood for their livelihood?” Lily inquired.

“No, they mainly produce various fruits,” Ethan clarified.

Clara Joy’s mind began to race with possibilities—this was precisely the next step she needed to consider. However, the villagers were busy today and wouldn’t be able to take her there. It seemed she would need to stay a few more days.

At noon, the four of them had a casual meal on the boat with the villagers. By afternoon, they returned from the small fishing village, and the sky was still bright.

Once back in town, Ethan invited Clara Joy and her friends to a high-end restaurant for dinner. After their meal, with plenty of time before curfew, they decided to stroll around.

“Please, you have to save my brother!” a small voice pleaded.

“Please, I’m begging you!” 

As they walked back to the inn, they came across a young boy kneeling on the ground, repeatedly bowing towards a medical clinic. Beside him lay another boy who looked extremely weak, barely clinging to life.

“Get lost, you little beggars! Who would pay to treat you?” a clerk at the clinic sneered from the entrance.

While some in the crowd felt pity for the boys, no one was willing to step in to help.

Clara Joy glanced over and immediately walked towards them. She knelt down beside the young boy and pressed on his pressure points, while Sarah reached into her purse and pulled out a bottle of healing tonic.

“Help him drink this,” Clara Joy instructed the stunned older brother.

The boy quickly reacted, realizing they were his only hope. Initially, the younger boy couldn’t swallow on his own. Clara Joy guided the older brother to help feed him sip by sip.

The healing tonic worked wonders, and soon the younger boy began to regain consciousness. 

“Brother, I’m so glad you’re awake,” he said weakly, making Clara Joy’s heart ache for the fragile child.

“Thank the kind lady! It’s thanks to her that you’re alright,” the older brother urged as he helped his sibling sit up and knelt before Clara Joy.

“No need for that. Your brother is too weak; you should take him home now,” Clara Joy insisted gently.

But the older boy remained stubborn, gazing at Clara Joy with determination. 

“What? Are you trying to extort me?” Clara Joy thought, taking a cautious step back. She didn’t want to meddle in their troubles, especially with so many eyes on her.

“Please, kind lady, take us in. We can work for you!” the older brother pleaded.

Clara Joy paused, taken aback. “Do you not have parents? Why would you want to leave?”

“Our mother passed away, and our father remarried. Our stepmother is unkind, and we’re often left without food. My brother fainted from hunger,” he explained, tears welling in his eyes. “Please, take us in! We’re really hard workers and willing to do anything.”

“Why would you think I would want to take you in?” Clara Joy asked, incredulous.

“Because you’re the only one who has helped us. You’re so kind; you wouldn’t treat us badly. Plus, you seem capable, so you must need help,” the little boy said earnestly.

“Even if I agreed, how do you know your stepmother would allow it?” Clara Joy countered.

“She’s been wanting to send us away to save money for her own children’s education. She would definitely agree,” the older boy urged, sensing her hesitation.

“Please, kind lady, take us in! We will be very obedient and loyal,” he implored.

“What can you two little ones even do?” Clara Joy asked, still skeptical.

“Whatever you need, we can help. Please!” they chorused.

Just then, a woman rushed toward them, anger etched on her face. 

“Look at you two, slacking off instead of working at home!” she shouted. “I see you’ve gone wild! If someone hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have known you were here!”

Clara Joy stepped in to intervene. “Hey, who are you? What do you think you’re doing?”

“This girl is a good person; she just saved my brother!” the older boy found his courage and defended Clara Joy.

The woman’s eyes narrowed, and she sneered, “Oh really? What did she do to my child?” she demanded, pulling back the sleeve of the younger boy to inspect him.

“Didn’t you cause this?” 

“Pay up!” 

Clara Joy watched the woman’s performance with a cold gaze. Did she really think everyone was blind? 

“Lady, wasn’t it you who neglected your child? Today, he fainted from hunger, and this kind lady helped him!” the older boy exclaimed, pretending to be confused.

The woman’s anger flared even more. “Ungrateful little wretches! After all these years I’ve taken care of you!” she cried, pointing a finger at the older boy’s head.

“I don’t care. My child is hurt, and you owe me money,” she insisted, her face devoid of shame despite the crowd’s disapproval.

“Everyone can see this. You think you can extort me?” Clara Joy challenged.

“Besides, these two children are now under my care. They have nothing to do with you!” 

Thus, the scene unfolded, with Clara Joy standing firm against the woman, determined to protect the boys who had captured her heart.
