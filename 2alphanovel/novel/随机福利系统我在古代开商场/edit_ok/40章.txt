Certainly! Let's adapt the chapter for an American audience:

**The Betrayer**

The she-wolf caught Ivy's words, and a flicker of reluctance appeared in her eyes before she turned away, heading back to her den with a melancholy gait. Ivy understood that this situation would require patience and time to mend.

As Ivy returned to the werewolf's den, she remembered the oversized shirt she had bought for him upon her arrival. Once the werewolf left, Ivy retrieved it from her backpack.

When the werewolf returned and saw the shirt lying on his makeshift bed, he looked puzzled. Ivy noticed his confusion and mimed tugging at her own clothes. After a moment of contemplation, the werewolf seemed to catch on.

Though he had initially been unclothed, he had managed to cover himself with leaves. As he changed into the shirt, Ivy stepped outside to give him privacy.

After waiting for a while, she sometimes heard his anxious sounds, which she found a bit amusing. Yet, when the werewolf finally emerged, fully dressed and without any mishaps, Ivy couldn’t help but admire his cleverness, despite his childlike understanding of human ways.

As evening settled, Ivy lit a small campfire inside the werewolf's den. The flames scared away the other wolves, and even the werewolf shrank back at its warmth. Ivy took the meat he had brought earlier, used a pocket knife to slice it into pieces, and skewered it on a stick to roast over the fire.

As the meat sizzled, she sprinkled some spices over it, filling the den with an enticing aroma. Noticing the werewolf's curious gaze, Ivy waved him over and offered him some of the freshly roasted meat.

The werewolf glanced between the fire and Ivy, unable to resist the tempting smell, and approached her side. Ivy took a piece of meat from the stick, standing up to feed it to him by hand.

After the incident with the magical water, the werewolf had learned how to eat from Ivy’s hand. While she fed him, Ivy also took a few bites for herself.

That night, the werewolf tried to pull Ivy into his nest. However, she quickly waved her hands and instead found a rock to lean against, settling in to sleep with her back against the wall.

The next day, the she-wolf returned to the den, howling and glancing at Ivy. Once she finished communicating with her son, the werewolf nodded toward Ivy. Seeing this, the she-wolf howled twice in Ivy's direction.

Ivy understood this meant the she-wolf was instructing the werewolf to go with her, and he agreed. Without further delay, Ivy took the werewolf's hand, and they set off.

The werewolf looked back several times, his eyes filled with reluctance and a soft whimper. The she-wolf and the other wolves responded in kind. Ivy felt a surge of emotion and gently patted the werewolf's head, vowing to care for him.

As they walked, Ivy held the werewolf's hand, encouraging him to walk instead of crawl. Whenever he seemed too tired to continue, she would offer him water to rejuvenate his spirits.

Once they reached the outskirts of town, Ivy took out a small pair of scissors and carefully trimmed the werewolf's whiskers, then combed through his hair. Finally, his true features emerged, revealing sharp, strikingly handsome features despite the dirt from the forest.

“From now on, your name will be Ethan, okay?” Ivy said, patting his shoulder.

“Ethan.”

“Ethan.”

Ivy repeated the name several times. It took a moment for Ethan to process, but soon he began mimicking her lip movements.

“Outrageous.”

Ivy shook her head, correcting him.

“Ethan.”

“New Year’s Eve.”

Ivy patiently taught Ethan until he could finally say his name correctly. With Ethan by her side, Ivy headed into town.

Though Ethan still struggled to walk smoothly, often bouncing or stumbling, he was determined not to crawl as Ivy discouraged it. Even when he was on the brink of exhaustion, he would only tug at Ivy’s hand, and she understood his need. Each time, she would offer him water to keep him going.

Ivy planned to buy Ethan two new sets of clothes, as the shirt he wore was too loose. As they searched for a shop, they came across a crowd gathered in front.

With no other path available, Ivy prepared to guide Ethan through a gap in the crowd. However, with people packed closely together, it was nearly impossible to get through.

Noticing Ethan’s growing impatience, Ivy quickly retreated, fearing his instincts might take over. With no other choice, she stood aside, waiting for the crowd to disperse.

In the meantime, Ivy overheard the argument at the center of the gathering. As the surrounding chatter filled the air, she pieced together the situation.

It seemed a man had married into the family of the shop owner. Now, with the shop struggling and only his wife remaining, he had sought a mistress and was publicly belittling her.

“Even if I sell the shop at a loss, I won’t give you a dime,” the woman declared fiercely.

“You can’t sell the shop, or I will divorce you!” she retorted.

“Divorce me? Hmph, who do you think you are? Just because your parents have passed, you think you can do whatever you want? I’ll have you know, if anyone’s filing for divorce, it’s me, Jack!” the man shouted.

Ivy was impressed by the woman’s boldness. During such times, defiance was rare, even though her voice trembled with fear.

What caught Ivy’s attention was the woman's mention of selling the shop at a loss.

“This shop isn’t doing well. Who’d want to buy it? Let me manage it; a woman like you shouldn’t be out in public,” Jack sneered.

“I’m interested in buying it,” Ivy called out loudly.

In that moment, she knew it was an opportunity she couldn’t miss.

The crowd turned to look at her, creating a path for her to step through.

“Are you serious about buying it at a loss?” the woman, Jane, asked, surprised. She hadn’t expected anyone to be interested. Her statement was meant to save face in front of her husband.

“Miss, this shop isn’t in a prime location, and business is poor. Are you really willing to take it over?” Jane questioned.

“I am, as long as you sell it at a low price,” Ivy replied.

“Alright, then I’ll sell it to you,” Jane said, walking into the shop, leaving the crowd behind, unsure of her actions.

Jack glared at Ivy, anger boiling over, blaming her for ruining his plans.

“Oh, buying the shop will only lead to losses,” he taunted.

“Not your concern,” Ivy replied, clear in her disdain for such a man. When his in-laws had money, he shamelessly relied on them, and now he revealed his true colors as a scoundrel.

“This is the divorce certificate. Get lost,” Jane said, handing it over.
