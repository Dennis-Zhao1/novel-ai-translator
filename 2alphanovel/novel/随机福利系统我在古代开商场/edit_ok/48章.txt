**Sick Horse**

That night, Clara Joy looked at the remaining five thousand dollars in her savings. There were so many expenses ahead, and she worried it wouldn’t stretch far enough.

"Well, I guess I’ll just have to make it work," she sighed, pulling the comforter over her head.

The following day, with no set plans, Clara decided to check on the construction project downtown. Ever since Old Tom took charge, he had dedicated himself to it completely, even setting up a small trailer to stay on-site. Clara realized she hadn’t kept up with the progress.

As she made her way, another thought popped into her head. Buying a horse was something she’d been meaning to do for a while but kept putting off. She promised herself that after checking on the construction, she’d finally get one.

"Hey, Sam, remind me to buy a horse later," she said.

Sam, having matured considerably over the last few days, nodded. "Buy a horse, got it."

"Exactly. Make sure to remind me," Clara confirmed.

"Okay."

Clara handed Sam a bottle of water. He was now adept at opening it himself, though he only took small sips, knowing she'd only give him a refill after a while.

As Clara approached the construction site, she could see the workers buzzing about. When she got closer, she was amazed; the scene resembled a modern construction site. Old Tom had only laid the foundation so far.

"Do people in this era really know how to lay a foundation?" Clara mused, slightly skeptical. After all, this was a fictional era that might differ from what she’d learned about ancient times.

"Old Tom, welcome to the twenty-first century!" she joked.

"What are you talking about now, young lady?" Old Tom replied, scratching his head.

Clara laughed awkwardly and approached a nearby worker. "Is it necessary to start building like this?"

"Not really. Only wealthy families use bricks and stones for foundations, or if they’re building something tall. Most folks just pack down the earth," he explained.

So, there was a method for laying foundations at this time. It seemed her lack of knowledge had misled her.

"Young lady, once I finish here, you need to teach me about that distillation device. I haven’t had a drop of whiskey while building this place, and it's driving me mad!" Old Tom exclaimed.

"Don't worry, Grandpa Tom," Clara assured him.

After leaving the construction site, Clara headed home. "Buy a horse, buy a horse," she reminded herself, tapping her head. She couldn’t understand why her memory seemed to be failing her lately.

"Yes, yes, Sam, you're doing great!" she encouraged him.

Sam beamed back at her, his smile wide.

Upon reaching the horse market, Clara didn’t rush to purchase immediately but took a stroll around first.

"Miss, come and take a look at our horses," a shopkeeper called out, and Clara paused. Today, she was dressed casually, and this was the first shopkeeper to approach her.

She followed him, listening to his introductions, but nothing caught her eye immediately.

"Neigh, neigh~"

As she walked past a few sick horses, one caught her attention. The horse was entirely snow-white, with not a single speck of color, although it lacked a bit of shine. It appeared utterly lifeless, struggling even to stand, yet it stubbornly tried to rise time and again. Its ears perked up, as if straining to hear the sounds around it.

When Clara stood before it, the horse summoned all its strength to stand up again, focusing intently on her.

"Sir, I want this horse," Clara declared.

"Miss, this horse is sick. Whether it will recover is uncertain, and even if it does, it has a stubborn temperament. It might be hard to train," the shopkeeper warned.

"That's fine, I want this one," Clara insisted.

Seeing her determination, the shopkeeper decided not to press further, though he sold the sick horse to her for twenty dollars.

After the purchase, the shopkeeper released the horse and handed Clara the reins. Clara reached out to stroke the horse, which nuzzled against her hand affectionately.

She looked up at the shopkeeper. "This horse is really quite stubborn. No one in our shop has been able to get this close to it."

As he spoke, he found it curious and reached out to try again. But as soon as he did, the horse began to neigh loudly, kicking its hind legs.

"It seems you and this horse are meant to be together," the shopkeeper remarked.

Clara nodded in agreement, feeling a connection forming.

"Do you want to install a carriage now?" he asked.

"No, not yet. I’ll wait until it gets better before bringing it back for that," Clara replied, leading the occasionally wobbly horse out of the market, feeding it some water.

“I can’t tell if I can help you, but I hope this makes you feel better soon,” she said, almost as if the horse could understand her words. It shook its head in response.

"What a beautiful horse!" said Ivy, as she saw Clara return with the horse.

"But why does it look so limp?" she inquired.

"It’s sick," Clara answered.

"Have you given it water? It’ll look even better once it recovers," Ivy urged.

Clara understood what Ivy meant by water. "I’ve fed it already."

Ivy reached out her hand, wanting to pet the horse, which obligingly leaned closer to her.

"The shopkeeper said it has a stubborn temperament and is hard to train."

"Stubborn? It seems quite obedient to me," Ivy replied.

"I think so too. Maybe it just feels comfortable around us," Clara agreed.

Sam, watching from the side, felt an urge to touch the horse as well.

"Sam, why don’t you give it a pat? If it doesn’t shy away from you, you can take care of it from now on, okay?"

"Okay, I like it," Sam said, reaching out to stroke the horse, a satisfied grin on his face.

"I’ll handle the bathing and feeding," he promised Clara.

"Sam, why don’t you give it a name?" Clara suggested.

"Snowy?" he proposed.

"Snowy, that's a lovely name. From now on, it will be called Snowy," Ivy chimed in.

Clara thought to herself that if the horse could truly understand human speech, it would probably be outraged, given how stubborn it had been back at the market.

"Alright, Snowy it is," Clara confirmed.

"When Snowy is better, I’ll be ready to head south," Clara said, sitting beside Ivy.

"Sounds good."

"In a couple of days, I’ll bring Quinn back. Otherwise, you’ll be all alone at home," Clara added.

"No need, I can manage on my own," Ivy replied confidently.

"Still, I’ll go hire a few people to come back with me. I really can’t shake this worry. Why don’t you come with me?" Clara urged.

"I’m not going. If you leave, who will take care of things at home? I’m supposed to be the second master overseeing everything," Ivy countered.

"But I really don’t feel at ease with you alone," Clara insisted, concern etched on her face.

"I can take care of myself now; I’ve learned some self-defense," Ivy reassured her.

Suddenly, Clara recalled the night when those intruders came for them.

"No, I’ll leave the place to Alex and Lana. You must come with me," Clara said firmly.

Seeing Clara’s serious expression, Ivy’s demeanor shifted to one of concern.

"What’s wrong? What are you thinking about?" she asked.

"Those people from the main city are trying to hurt us," Clara confessed.

"Alright, I’m scared. I’ll go with you," Ivy quickly replied.
