**Revised Plan**

"Alright, I've got ten roots available. If you want them all, it'll be five thousand dollars," Clara Joy said with easy confidence.

Five thousand dollars? Ethan Jade was taken aback by the amount.

“Don’t worry, Ethan. You won’t be taken advantage of. We can go to a clinic to verify the quality,” Clara assured him.

Seeing Clara’s unwavering certainty about the price eased Ethan’s doubts. However, he realized that his current situation at home wasn't exactly rosy, and all his savings barely added up to five thousand dollars. If he spent it all without gaining his family’s favor, he’d end up losing both his position and resources.

“Think it over, Ethan. If these roots can win your family's attention, you could return to the city. Then, five thousand dollars would be mere pocket change for you,” Clara said nonchalantly.

Ethan was completely unaware that he was being led by the nose by Clara Joy.

He imagined being valued, receiving praise from his family, and getting an increase in his monthly allowance. Gradually, his eyes lit up with hope.

“Alright, I’ll buy them all.”

“Great! But you probably don’t have that much cash on you right now. I don’t have the roots with me either, so let’s head home to collect them. We’ll meet back here in half an hour.”

After watching Ethan leave, Clara Joy excitedly patted Jack's arm.

This feeling of happiness was exhilarating—she had just earned a hefty sum from someone she didn’t particularly like, and they were grateful to her for it.

"Clara, you seemed really annoyed at first. Why did you end up being so friendly with Ethan?" Jack asked, puzzled.

"Ah, my dear friend, you don’t understand. I was upset because he crossed my line, but later, I remembered we're in the business of commerce. It’s best not to offend anyone. We should speak appropriately to everyone, even turning those we dislike into customers. That way, we can earn their money—that’s what we should learn," Clara paused and blinked playfully.

"The most important part is that I get to make money off him. It feels so good!" Clara Joy said, fighting back laughter.

Though she might not be a model merchant, this was simply who she was, and how she operated was learned from observing others in her past life.

Jack nodded, beginning to understand Clara’s perspective as a merchant. First, have a bottom line. Second, avoid offending anyone, transforming those you dislike into customers to earn from them, and find joy in that.

If Clara knew about Jack's summary, she would surely have praised him, but…

Upon returning home, Clara Joy found Lisa sitting in the middle of the porch, looking forlornly at the door.

"Clara, Jack, you’re finally back!” Lisa exclaimed.

Seeing her, Jack instinctively wanted to flee, but Clara grabbed him.

“You need to learn to face problems instead of running away from them. Besides, she’ll be part of our team from now on, so you can’t escape,” Clara said with a smile.

Jack immediately wilted.

“Jack, from now on we can work together. Aren’t you happy?” Lisa blinked her big eyes, completely ignoring the displeasure on Jack's face.

Jack felt utterly helpless but still nodded. He knew that if he shook his head, Lisa would likely burst into tears.

“I knew Jack would be the best!”

Clara Joy paid no mind to their exchange. She found an excuse to retreat to her room and retrieved the ten ginseng roots.

Then she took Jack and Lisa to exchange them for five thousand dollars in a cashier’s check.

Once they got home, Clara accepted Lisa's earnest expression of gratitude and her small gift. Among the items, a handmade plush doll caught Clara’s eye.

“Isn’t this pretty? I made it myself!” Lisa said, following Clara’s gaze.

“It really is nice, your skills are commendable,” Clara replied, genuinely impressed.

But Lisa didn’t seem to acknowledge Clara’s compliment, instead sticking close to Jack and calling him “buddy” over and over.

Clara sighed and looked at her other friends.

“I might just be a stepping stone on her road to friendship,” Clara mused.

Her friends exchanged sympathetic glances, clearly saying, “As long as you know.”

That evening, Clara Joy called her friends, Sarah and Emily, to her room. She laid out all the money on the table—a total of over six thousand six hundred dollars.

“This money belongs to the three of us. It should have been divided between you two earlier.”

"Now, each of you will get two thousand two hundred dollars, and the remaining few dollars will go into the communal fund for buying supplies. How does that sound?”

Clara placed two thousand two hundred dollars in front of each of them.

“But most of this is what you earned, Clara! You collected the ginseng yourself, and Sarah and I barely know it, yet you sold it,” Emily protested.

Hearing this, Clara’s mood soured.

Sarah knew Clara would soon start lecturing them about fairness.

“Fine, then I’ll just take it with my sister. If you need money, just let us know,” Sarah said, and this made Clara smile again.

She thought of how in her previous life, after every payday, they would happily embrace each other, and it was the same now.

“Let’s all sleep together tonight. It’s been a while since we had a good chat,” Clara said, playfully pouting at the two.

“Sure! I love sleeping with you all!” Emily exclaimed.

Clara and Sarah exchanged glances, their lips twitching. They wondered how squished they would end up being, especially since Emily had a notoriously awful sleeping posture.

But they were happy nonetheless.

“What are your thoughts about what’s next?” Sarah asked Clara, lying on the bed.

“Well, you know beauty treatments, playing board games, and other leisure activities. My sister cooks a variety of delicious dishes, and I saw that the cute stuffed toy Lisa gave me was made by her. So, I think we can open a large shopping mall,” Clara suggested.

“We also need to have our own influence; otherwise, we can’t protect our business.”

Sarah always provided detailed advice for Clara.

“Exactly! We’ll recruit many people to work for us,” Clara replied.

Listening to Clara and Sarah talk, Emily couldn’t interject a word, but she nodded repeatedly, her mind wandering off to what kind of food she could sell later.

“For the first shopping mall, we probably can’t manage it all ourselves, so we can bring in some investments,” Clara continued with her ideas.

In her mind, the mall would have five floors: the first for a supermarket, the second for a children’s area, the third for adults, the fourth for food, and the fifth for leisure.

Clara was well aware that implementing all this would require a significant amount of money and time, but once the mall opened, it wouldn’t just cater to the townspeople but also attract visitors from surrounding towns and villages.

Even before they expanded to other counties, people from neighboring counties would be drawn in.

“We can definitely become the wealthiest in the country,” Clara declared.

At that moment, the three girls’ ambitions were magnified.

“Let’s go for it! Let’s go for it!”
