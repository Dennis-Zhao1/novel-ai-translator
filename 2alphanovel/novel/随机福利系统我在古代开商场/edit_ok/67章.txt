**A Declaration of Love**

After Ethan Smith arrived, Clara instructed him to head towards the grassland tribe. They were already near the border, needing just two more hours to reach the border tribe of the Prairie Kingdom.

As they approached the grassland tribe, Clara could distinctly feel that the customs here were much more open compared to those in her homeland. Peering out from the window of the carriage, she saw numerous women rolling up their sleeves, busily working, while others called out to attract customers.

"Hey Clara, look at all those stalls selling beef jerky!"

"Yeah, let's find a place to stay first, then we can explore," Clara replied with a smile.

With Ethan's help, their group found a cozy lodge. They were soon ready to head out for a leisurely stroll. However, Shawn was reluctant to join. He was so engrossed in his martial arts training that he seemed almost obsessed.

"I’ll just stay and train with Brian and Uncle John. You and Emily can go."

"Come on, Shawn, you should come with us! You've been training so hard lately; it's not good for you," Emily urged with a teasing tone.

Among their group, Shawn was undoubtedly the most skilled in martial arts, thanks to his incredible talent. Coupled with his constant practice in the wild, he had become physically robust and agile.

"I still won’t go. I enjoy training too much," Shawn insisted, shaking his head with a grin.

Emily pouted playfully. "Fine, but don't blame us if we find all the good snacks!"

Upon arriving at the market, Clara was greeted by an array of unique offerings from the Prairie Kingdom—beef jerky, fresh cuts of beef and lamb, various dairy products, and other meat snacks.

Emily trailed beside Ethan, eagerly asking him to inquire about any delicious foods they spotted.

"Ethan, can you ask how much the beef jerky is per pound?" Clara approached a stall selling beef jerky and turned to Ethan.

Before he could respond, the vendor shouted out first, "Beef jerky is ten dollars a pound! Miss, would you like to buy some?"

His heavily accented words left Clara momentarily stunned, prompting her to ask him to repeat it.

"Miss, this..."

"Don't be fooled by him; he loves to scam folks like you outsiders. Here, beef isn’t worth much. Beef jerky should only be five dollars a pound at most."

Suddenly, a young man darted in from the side, interrupting Ethan. The vendor, hearing this, was clearly agitated.

"You troublemaker, stop ruining my business!" He yelled, brandishing a stick at the young man.

Emily, standing close by, quickly snatched the stick from the vendor’s grasp and pushed it back towards him. "You, as a seller, should know about honesty! How can you blame others for ruining your business?"

"Let's go; we won't buy anything," Clara decided, leading Sarah and Lucy away.

After they had walked a short distance, Clara instructed Sarah to give the young man a few dollars. 

"Thank you, miss! Thank you!" he exclaimed gratefully.

"You’re from the Southern Kingdom!" Clara stated, confirming her suspicion.

"Yes, my sister and I are from the Southern Kingdom. My mother is from the Northern Kingdom, so I speak both languages. I come here to help some people from the South and earn a bit of money."

"Don't you fear getting hurt?" 

"I’m used to it now; as long as I can earn some money, it's worth it."

Clara nodded, allowing him to leave. She continued wandering through the streets until she came across a store that was impressively decorated and exceptionally clean. It felt refreshing to her.

They stepped inside, and it was filled with various items, resembling a small supermarket. Everything was clearly marked with prices, and nothing seemed overly expensive. For instance, the beef jerky here was listed at five dollars a pound.

In this era through which Clara and her companions traversed, every region used the same currency—dollars, silver coins, and gold coins. After browsing around, Clara made a few token purchases, but she still had some plans in mind and wanted to check out other shops.

Just as they exited the store, a group of people blocked their path. Clara and her friends immediately went on high alert. The leader of the group babbled on in a foreign tongue.

Clara looked to Ethan for help. 

"He says he thinks you are extraordinarily beautiful with your fair skin and delicate frame. He believes you need protection and he likes you. He’s wondering if you’d consider him."

Is this a love confession?

"Ethan, please tell him I’m not interested. And ask him and his buddies to step aside."

"He says you can try dating first."

"I'm not interested," Clara replied firmly.

"But he says he really likes you and wants you to think about it again."

"Please tell him that I'm married."

Upon hearing this, the leader became visibly agitated. 

"He says you are obviously from the Southern Kingdom. People there tie their hair up once married, but your hair is down, so he believes you aren’t married."

"I do not like him at all."

"He insists on taking you out for a meal first, so you can get to know each other."

"And if I refuse?"

"He says that it’s quite normal for such things here, and if you don’t agree, it would be disrespectful to him."

As Clara glanced around, she noticed the crowd was growing larger. They were in someone else's country and didn't want to cause trouble. Even if they did fight, it appeared the locals were strong and united.

Clara’s gaze shifted, and she suddenly spotted a familiar face.

"Ethan, tell him I’m truly married and my husband will be here any moment!"

"He says he wants to see your husband first. Otherwise, he won’t back off."

"He also wants to see if your husband is worthy of you. If not, he’ll keep trying; even if you are married, you can still leave each other."

"Where have you been, my husband!" 

Ethan had been frustrated by the group blocking his path when suddenly someone called him "husband."

"Please help me!" Clara whispered urgently to him.

"Five hundred dollars."

"That's too expensive; three hundred!"

"Six hundred."

"Four hundred!"

"Seven hundred."

"Fine, five hundred it is, just help me out of this mess!" Clara grit her teeth, exasperated.

"Five hundred isn’t going to cut it now; it has to be seven hundred."

"Okay. Just hurry and help me!"

Clara’s smile blossomed as she grinned brightly.

Ethan wrapped his arm around Clara and stepped forward to face the suitor. 

He spoke in the language of the Northern Kingdom, and the mysterious suitor’s expression shifted as he gazed intently at Clara. 

In the end, the man left reluctantly, casting a lingering glance back at Clara. 

As he departed, he said something to her, and Ethan quickly translated. 

"He said if your husband treats you poorly in the future, you can come find him, and he’ll love you well."
