**The Unruly One**

After a small wave of success, Clara Joy's family had sold a good amount of their chestnuts and hawthorns. However, there were still a few left in the basket as the market began to thin out.

“Let’s just wait and sell what we can. If it doesn’t sell today, we’ll just try again tomorrow,” Ethan suggested, glancing at the dwindling crowd.

“No way,” Clara replied, crossing her arms with determination. She was not about to leave with any leftovers from their sales.

“You stay here and keep selling. I’m going to see if I can sell some to the wealthier families in the town.” With that, Clara hoisted her full basket onto her back and headed towards the more affluent part of town.

Whether it was luck or fate, she soon found herself face-to-face with a young woman from one of the wealthier families.

“Roasted chestnuts and sweet hawthorns for sale! A perfect snack, delicious and sweet!” Clara called out with a smile as she passed by the young woman.

Hearing her call, the young woman signaled her attendant to stop Clara. She had managed to sneak out today after much pleading with her mother and was eager to indulge in some tasty treats.

“Hey, wait a second!” 

Clara perked up at the sound of the voice and turned around.

“Miss, how many bags would you like?” she asked, sensing a potential sale.

The young woman noted Clara's eagerness to sell before even knowing her interest. But the truth was, she did want to try the snacks, so she decided to overlook the abruptness.

“How much are they?”

“Miss, the chestnuts are seven dollars per bag, and the hawthorns are eight dollars per bag.”

“That cheap? Are they any good?”

Clara felt a surge of emotion at the question. “Miss, that’s already on the higher side!” The attendant beside the young woman sighed, knowing her mistress’s comments made negotiation challenging.

Clara noticed the attendant’s frustration but knew she had to make her products appealing to secure a sale.

“You can give it a try! Our hawthorns and chestnuts are all roasted with sugar, and you can see the thick layer of sugar coating the hawthorns.” Clara explained eagerly to the attendant.

“Hey, why didn’t you let me try? I’m the one who’s going to eat it anyway!” The young woman pouted, feeling a bit slighted that Clara directed her offer toward the attendant instead.

“Well, you can certainly try some too. If you like it, you can buy it afterward.”

With curiosity, the young woman picked up a piece of the sweet hawthorn. As it touched her tongue, a burst of sweetness filled her mouth, followed by the tangy flavor of the hawthorn—a delightful blend of sweet and sour that left her wanting more.

She then took a piece of the chestnut that the attendant peeled for her, savoring its sweet and fluffy texture.

“If I’m going to buy, how much for two bags of each?”

Despite being aware of the young woman’s wealth, Clara didn't want to exploit her; she didn’t want to ruin her business reputation.

“Two bags of chestnuts will be thirteen dollars, and two bags of hawthorns will be fifteen dollars.”

“How many bags do you have of each?” The young woman asked, her excitement palpable.

“Twenty bags of each.”

“I want them all!”

“Alright then, that’ll be a total of 280 dollars.”

“Here’s fifty dollars; no need for change. Just have someone deliver it to my house,” the young woman instructed, pointing at her attendant.

“Oh, wait! I’ll take one bag of each to snack on while I walk.”

Clara found the young woman refreshingly straightforward.

“Just a reminder, even if you enjoy them, don’t eat too many hawthorns at once. If there are pregnant women at home, it’s best they avoid them.”

The young woman looked puzzled. 

“You, the seller, are telling me not to eat too much? Wouldn’t it be better for you if I enjoyed them? You’d sell even more!”

“But it’s important to keep you and your family healthy.”

“Okay, but I have a big family; even if everyone gets a share, it won’t be enough. No need to worry.”

Clara felt a wave of joy wash over her. She hadn’t expected such luck—selling everything and making a good profit!

She thought about returning to see if her sister, Ethan, still had any left to bring over for sale.

Meanwhile, Ethan was still at her stall, watching as people passed by. Many were drawn in by her beauty alone; she didn’t need to shout out her wares or wear a big smile like the others. This unusual demeanor made many believe her goods must be exceptional, so much so that she didn’t need to advertise them.

As lunchtime approached, students from nearby schools began to spill onto the streets, and Ethan’s radiant beauty caught their attention. They flocked to her stall without her needing to utter a single word.

Indeed, beauty was an invaluable asset anywhere.

From a distance, Clara spotted Ethan standing in front of her stall, surrounded by a group of young men in nice clothes, fanning themselves. Ethan, however, wore a cool expression as she collected money and handed over goods.

“May I ask for your name, and where do you hail from, my lady?” one of the young men asked charmingly.

Ethan shot him a sidelong glance. Didn’t people nowadays believe in modesty?

“Are you here to buy? I sell chestnuts and hawthorns. If you’re not interested, please step aside so others can buy.”

“I’m merely captivated by your beauty, my lady. I wish to know you better. My family deals in grain, and I have some wealth. I’m still unmarried, and if you….” The rest of his words were left unspoken, but everyone grasped the implications.

Ethan’s expression turned icy. This was beyond mere boldness; it was shameless.

And revealing his wealth? Other girls might have fallen for his charm, but she was having none of it.

“If you’re not here to buy, please leave.”

“I merely wish for you to consider my words; look at this sun and wind.”

“I have no interest in considering anything, nor do I have the mood for it.”

“Such a shameless guy! I thought students would have better sense.” Clara interjected as she walked past, overhearing the murmurs from the crowd.

“Since you’re here, your school must be nearby, perhaps Greenfield Academy? I’ve heard that its teachers value character above all else. It seems they’ve yet to see what kind of person you are.”

Clara pulled Ethan behind her. She knew her sister could handle herself, but if things turned physical, they wouldn’t be able to take on the group behind them.

“However, I see that you’re somewhat reasonable. I’d like to believe that you were only jesting.”

The young man looked around and suddenly realized a crowd had gathered.

Recalling his family's words and the effort it took to be accepted into Greenfield Academy, he felt a twinge of shame.

“Indeed, I apologize for my rudeness. I was too forward.”

If not for your money, I’d have my sister teach you a lesson, Clara thought angrily, cursing the man silently in her mind.

Yet her expression remained unchanged, a polite smile plastered on her face.

“Since you’ve come this far, you must be interested in our snacks. Why not buy some? We sisters hardly make a profit and have to endure the elements.”

“I’ll take everything! I’ll treat my classmates. Since you don’t profit much, why not raise the price a bit? That way, I can offer it as a gift.”

What a fool, Clara thought to herself.

“Alright, I see you have ten bags each, so let’s say fifty dollars for each bag. That totals to one thousand dollars.”

Clara feigned an expression of being deeply touched, beaming at the young man with gratitude.
