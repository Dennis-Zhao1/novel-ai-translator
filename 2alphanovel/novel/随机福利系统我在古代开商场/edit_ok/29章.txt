**A Great Mentor**

Time passed quickly, and before Clara Joy and her friends realized it, December 10th had arrived. During this period, they had kept themselves incredibly busy.

Each morning, they embraced the brisk air of their small town with a jog, followed by a casual breakfast of pancakes and coffee. Afterward, they drove into town to set up their market stall. Lunchtime was a welcome break before heading off to train with their mentor, Kan Lanzi. Clara Joy always ensured to give her friend, Bailey Rose, a therapeutic treatment before their training. As the sun set, they returned home for dinner and continued their martial arts practice.

Their training schedule had been ongoing for over a year, and it had become a way of life for Clara Joy and her friends.

Clara Joy’s sister, Sophie, often watched them practice and sometimes joined in after dinner. This meant Clara Joy and her friends had to wait until Sophie went to bed to continue their intense sessions, often leading them to doze off under the stars in their backyard.

Sophie admired their dedication, which often led her to reflect on her own pursuits.

After finishing at the market one day, Clara Joy was getting ready to head home when she spotted Ethan approaching.

“Need something, Ethan?” she asked, her tone casual but curious.

“I keep telling you, just call me Ethan. Skip the formalities,” he replied with his usual easygoing style.

“Alright, spill it. What’s up?” Clara Joy responded with a playful impatience.

“My grandfather sent me to fetch you. Says he needs your expertise.”

Clara Joy knew this must be about her medical skills. It was the only reason the Yan family would call for her.

Seeing her nod in agreement, Ethan parked the car and mounted the driver's seat.

“You two head back. I’ll catch up later,” Clara Joy instructed her friends, Shu and Bailey, before hopping into Ethan’s car.

As they drove to the Yan residence, Ethan’s endless chatter filled the car, making Clara Joy’s head spin.

When they finally arrived, seeing Old Mr. Yan felt like a relief.

“Mr. Yan.”

“Ah, you’re here. Please, take a seat. I’m afraid we need your help once again.”

Clara Joy noticed a young woman seated next to the old man, likely around her age.

“This is my sister,” Ethan introduced.

Clara Joy exchanged greetings with the woman.

“My granddaughter has had a rough time lately and came to seek solace with her old grandpa here,” the old man explained.

“Oh, it’s just that my sister’s been trying for a baby without success. Her husband blames her health, and she’s quite upset. We were hoping you could take a look,” Ethan explained, cutting to the chase.

“Has she consulted a doctor?” Clara Joy asked.

“Yes, the family doctor insists it’s her problem. And her husband’s new girlfriend is already expecting,” the woman said, her voice a mix of disbelief and frustration.

Despite her doubts about Clara Joy’s age, Yan Ru respected her grandfather’s high praise for Clara Joy’s skills and remained polite.

Clara Joy moved closer to Yan Ru to check her pulse, while the others held their breath, not wanting to interrupt.

“Miss Yan, your health is actually quite strong. You’re not infertile; your body is well-maintained, making conception quite likely,” Clara Joy informed her.

“Then why did the doctor say I was unwell, and why haven’t I conceived?” Yan Ru asked softly.

Clara Joy, appreciating her calmness, offered more information.

“Infertility isn’t always the woman’s issue. Feel free to seek a second opinion. As for your husband’s girlfriend’s pregnancy...” Clara Joy left the rest unsaid, but the implication was clear.

Yan Ru found it hard to accept. She had suffered so much anguish over her inability to have children.

Old Mr. Yan and Ethan trusted Clara Joy’s expertise, but how they handled this family matter was up to them.

Seeing the family’s somber expressions, Clara Joy thought it best to leave.

But Old Mr. Yan stopped her.

“There’s one more thing, Clara.”

“Yes, Mr. Yan?”

“I see great potential in you. My grandson here is too naive for business, and I'd like him to learn from you.”

Clara Joy was taken aback; this was unexpected.

“Mr. Yan, you flatter me. I’m just managing a small business with no grand experience to offer your grandson.”

Old Mr. Yan stroked his beard thoughtfully.

“I trust you’ll become quite accomplished; I wouldn’t be wrong about you.”

Clara Joy glanced at Ethan, who seemed just as surprised by his grandfather’s words. She couldn’t help but smile.

“Well, if you believe in me, I’ll accept,” she agreed, realizing that having Ethan as an ally could be beneficial as her business grew, given the Yan family’s influence.

“Ethan, show your respect to your mentor and learn well!” Old Mr. Yan encouraged.

“Grandpa, she’s younger than me! Isn’t this a bit embarrassing?” Ethan protested.

“But she’s far more diligent, and you have much to learn from her,” the old man reasoned. “Or would you prefer returning to your studies?”

Reluctantly, Ethan knelt before Clara Joy.

“Master, please accept my respect.”

Old Mr. Yan nodded, satisfied. “See? Still under my influence.”

“We’ll have a small ceremony soon,” he added to Clara Joy.

“No, no, let’s keep it simple. I really don’t want any attention,” Clara Joy insisted.

Understanding her wish for privacy, Old Mr. Yan relented, allowing Ethan to bow a few more times.

Inside, Clara Joy felt a bit anxious about what she could teach Ethan.

As she left the Yan residence, Clara Joy felt like she was dreaming and thought:

She had gained a great ally now.

And one with wealth and influence.

Choosing to jog home to make up for her missed evening exercise, Clara Joy felt a sense of excitement about the future.
