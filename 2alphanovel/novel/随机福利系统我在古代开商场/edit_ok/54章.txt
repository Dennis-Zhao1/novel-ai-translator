**Becoming a Thief**

Clara Joy and her companions found themselves at a crossroads, with no clear destination in sight. They decided to settle in a small forest just outside the county line, sharing the sandwiches and snacks that Clara’s sister, Sophie, and their friend Alex had prepared the day before.

As the group finished their meal, Clara Joy leaned in closer to Sophie, her eyes alight with mischief. "The system rewarded me with an invisibility pill," she said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm planning to pay a visit to Maplewood Village."

Sophie’s eyes widened with excitement, her breath catching in her throat. She quickly covered her mouth to stifle her enthusiasm. "Do you have an extra one? I want to come too!" she pleaded eagerly.

"Just one," Clara replied, her tone tinged with apology.

"Fine, just hurry back! Grab everything you can from them!" Sophie encouraged, her frustration evident. They had heard plenty of stories about Maplewood Village while searching for a place to stay, and the tales were chilling. The villagers were notorious for their cruelty, abducting women and robbing travelers. Anyone who dared resist was often never heard from again.

It was maddening that the local authorities did nothing to curb their actions, turning a blind eye to the village's misdeeds, leaving the local populace in despair.

Clara had also learned that the strongest fighters in the village weren't the third-in-command but rather the elusive leader and his two strategists.

"You all stay here with my sister while I head out," Clara instructed with confidence.

"I want to go too!" Sophie’s brother, Jack, quickly chimed in.

Autumn, who had been quietly observing, also expressed a desire to join.

"I'm not doing anything dangerous! You guys just wait here for me," Clara waved them off with a reassuring smile.

With that, she used her agility to slip away into the shadows. Sophie quickly grabbed Jack’s arm to stop him from following. "Jack, don’t worry! Clara will be just fine!"

Feeling left out, Jack looked disappointed but eventually nodded in agreement.

Clara made her way to a vantage point where she could see Maplewood Village. She paused, considering the fact that while the third-in-command’s skills matched her own, the leader and the two strategists were even stronger. She knew that if she went any closer, she risked being discovered.

"Host, the invisibility pill lasts for only two hours, so you need to hurry. Otherwise, you could get caught," a voice from her system reminded her.

After observing for a while from her perch in the trees, Clara finally swallowed the invisibility pill. 

She approached the village gate, where two watchtowers stood tall on either side, guards on duty. Clara pushed the gate open and walked straight inside.

The guards heard the creak of the gate and exchanged puzzled looks. Seeing no one, they were baffled by how the gate could have opened on its own.

They descended from their posts and found the door ajar, the area around them empty.

"Could it have been the wind?" one of them speculated.

"What wind? Did you feel any?" another retorted.

"No."

"Then it can’t be the wind, can it?"

"Then what was it? There’s no one here."

"Is it a ghost?"

"Don’t be ridiculous."

"Keep your voice down! The leader doesn’t believe in that nonsense. We’ll get in trouble if he hears us."

Clara glanced back at the confused guards, a mischievous grin creeping onto her face. 

She then leaped onto the rooftops, carefully lifting tiles one by one in search of the storeroom. However, before she could locate it, she was spotted by three people inside one of the rooms.

"Who's there?" one called out.

One of the three leaped onto the roof, scanning the area cautiously. 

Clara held her breath, terrified to make a sound as she watched the man search nearby. After what felt like an eternity, he finally descended back into the room.

"Let’s check the storeroom to see if anything is missing," he ordered.

Clara quietly crawled to the edge of the roof, listening as the man instructed another, "Forget it; I’ll go myself."

Rather than following immediately, Clara stayed back, watching carefully. Only when the man returned did she leap down.

The clever villagers had hidden the storeroom in the most dilapidated building. Clara hadn’t even considered that run-down shack during her search.

Moreover, there were no warning signs or barriers on the walls of that crumbling structure. Clara climbed inside, and before she knew it, she accidentally triggered a trap that sent a barrage of arrows flying toward her.

Caught off guard, Clara scrambled to defend herself.

The commotion naturally drew the attention of the villagers, who rushed toward the noise. Clara pulled out her rope, using it to deflect the arrows as she dashed into the building.

Inside, however, she found it completely empty.

"Have I been tricked?" Clara thought in dismay.

"Host, keep moving forward. There’s something good ahead," the system’s voice piped up again.

Clara sensed that footsteps were nearing, so she hurried onward, hoping to find a hidden room. Her hands flew over the walls, searching for a switch.

Just as the door swung open, Clara discovered the mechanism to a hidden door; she slipped inside just as the guards entered.

Once inside, Clara was greeted with the sight of numerous treasure chests. Without a moment to lose, she began shoving everything into her storage pouch.

When someone opened the door, Clara seized the opportunity to slip out from the side and nimbly scale the rooftop to escape.

Without pausing for breath, Clara sprinted back toward the direction where Sophie and the others were waiting. Along the way, she spotted the man she'd previously saved, lurking at a distance from the village.

"Antidote," Clara said to her system as she approached her hiding spot.

"No antidote available," it replied flatly.

Sighing, Clara settled onto a tree branch to wait for the effects of the invisibility pill to wear off. She also took a moment to examine her haul.

Aside from a substantial sum of cash—ten thousand dollars—most of what she had pilfered were weapons.

Looking at the weapons reminded Clara of the conversation she had overheard between the three men who had spotted her earlier. They were certainly ambitious...

"You’re back?" Sophie exclaimed as she rushed over, a small campfire crackling nearby.

"How did it go? What did you get?"

"I couldn’t find the storeroom where they kept the money, but I did get ten thousand dollars," Clara replied, trying to keep her tone light.

Sophie pouted, clearly disappointed. "So they got off easy?"

Clara shook her head, "I disagree. Taking their weapons is likely a bigger blow to them than money."

As she had suspected, chaos reigned in Maplewood Village at that moment. The leader and his two strategists were throwing fits, barking orders in frustration.

They had searched the entire village and found no trace of the thief, yet all their weapons had vanished right from under their noses!

"Who could have done this?" one of them shouted in disbelief.

The guards at the gate exchanged glances, suspecting a connection to the mysterious opening of the gate, but no one dared to speak of it.

Suddenly, a figure appeared outside the village, prompting the guards to ring the alarm.

The villagers instantly went on high alert. But because their opponents were highly skilled and their weapons were missing, Maplewood Village soon fell under siege.

"Didn’t they say Maplewood Village is hard to breach, with advanced weapons? How could they be so weak?" Ethan Jade, the leader of their group, commented dryly.

"Was it not you who stole our weapons?" the village’s second-in-command challenged, still in disbelief.

"Why would we resort to such underhanded tactics?" Ethan replied coolly.

"Enough chatter. Move out!" Ethan commanded, his expression icy.

Thus, Maplewood Village faded into obscurity.

Ethan interrogated the leader of Maplewood Village, only to learn that before they attacked, someone had snuck in and stolen their weapons right under their noses. That was how they had managed to take the village so easily.

Clara, blissfully unaware of these events, was simply thrilled with her unexpected windfall of ten thousand dollars that would replenish her nearly depleted resources.
