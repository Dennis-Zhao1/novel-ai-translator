**A Qing**

The next day, Clara Joy took Ethan Matthews along for a stroll through the bustling streets. As they wandered past various shops offering a myriad of goods, Clara felt a growing curiosity to explore more deeply. Eventually, she decided to revisit the shop where she had negotiated for beef jerky the previous day. With determination, she led Ethan back to the store.

Ethan, catching onto Clara's intentions, stepped inside to discuss matters with the shopkeeper. "Clara, let's hang out here for a bit while the shopkeeper fetches his boss," he suggested after a brief conversation. He returned to Clara, who glanced up just as the shopkeeper gave her a slight nod.

As they waited, a friendly staff member led them upstairs and offered them some coffee.

"Ethan, do you plan to keep up this hustle?" Clara asked, a hint of curiosity in her voice.

"Yeah, gotta earn a living somehow. Plus, I kind of enjoy the challenge," Ethan replied with a touch of pride.

They chatted casually, and Clara discovered that he had a set of young twins at home.

Just as Clara took a sip of her coffee, a knock resonated from the door. Ivy opened it to reveal a middle-aged man who exuded an air of integrity.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, they transitioned into serious discussions. Clara expressed her intention to purchase a variety of items. The shopkeeper was taken aback; Clara was essentially looking to buy everything in the store and establish a long-term order. However, he faced a dilemma similar to the one with her previous supplier, as certain products like beef were challenging to preserve. Clara had her methods, but she couldn't disclose them directly to the shopkeeper.

She had a confidentiality agreement with her previous partner, which restricted her from sharing the ice-making technique with anyone else. Because of this preservation issue, the negotiations were temporarily put on hold.

Feeling a bit deflated, Clara stepped out of the shop, realizing she had been too eager to make money without considering all aspects. Yet, she was unwilling to give up on the beef order; its potential was too promising.

"Hey, Clara, do you have time tomorrow?" Ethan suddenly asked.

"What’s up, Ethan?" Clara replied, intrigued.

"My wife wants to invite you over for dinner," he explained.

Clara felt a bit puzzled but intrigued, her eyes reflecting her curiosity as she looked at Ethan.

"My wife is quite the host; whenever someone I know comes around, she's eager to whip up a feast. She always insists on having them over for a meal," he continued.

After a moment of hesitation, Clara agreed, thinking it might be a good way to take her mind off things for a while.

The following day, Clara and her family gathered some gifts before heading back with Ethan to visit his home.

"Come on in, make yourselves at home!" Ethan's wife, Anne, welcomed them warmly.

Ethan's house was a charming, traditional two-story home, and several helpers were bustling about. As Clara and her party stepped out of the car, a friendly woman hurried over to greet them.

"This must be Clara!" Anne exclaimed, pulling Clara into a warm embrace. "I've heard so much about you from Ethan. He says you’re a remarkably ambitious young woman destined for great things!"

"Oh, Ethan is just being kind; I’m just running a small business," Clara laughed modestly.

"Child, this is no small business! Once your market opens..." Ethan started to say, but was interrupted by Anne.

"And this is Miss Emily, and the young master? They’re both wonderful, such good-looking kids!" Anne then turned her attention to Clara’s sister, Emily, who stood beside her.

"Thanks for having us, Anne," Clara said politely.

"Oh, you’re not intruding at all! Just call me Aunt Anne," Anne replied.

"Sure thing, Aunt Anne," Clara responded with a smile.

"Alright, let’s stop standing at the door and head inside to chat," Anne suggested, waving to a helper to park their car.

Since they had traveled from another town, they had already eaten lunch on the way. Now it was well past noon, and Anne invited them for dinner.

Clara noticed Ethan's twins, just three years old and irresistibly adorable, calling her and Emily "Sister" with their sweet, chubby faces. Clara couldn't help but be enchanted by the pair, alternating between hugging one and then the other.

Meanwhile, Anne was bustling around with the cook in the kitchen. Clara caught a glimpse of their main dish for the evening—roast lamb.

"I’m not sure if you’re used to eating beef, but a hot pot with it is incredibly delicious," Anne mentioned, knowing that in their area, beef wasn’t a common dish.

"We're quite accustomed to it," Clara assured her.

"That's great! Then tonight we’ll have beef hot pot!" Anne beamed.

Clara watched as one of the twins nestled in her arms while observing the cook prepare the dish, realizing that the hot pot resembled a clear broth-style fondue.

During dinner, there were no distinctions between hosts and guests; typically, the men would gather at one table while the women would sit at another. Anne was concerned that Clara and her sisters might mind this arrangement, but after confirming they didn’t, she became even more personable with them.

"Even though they’re individuals we've hired, they’re still people. They help me with work and can also share a meal with us," Anne said with a smile.

Clara agreed, appreciating the sentiment, especially since they had all transitioned into their new roles in life.

The women’s table finished eating quite early, and Clara and her sisters took the opportunity to play and chat with the twins. Meanwhile, the men continued drinking at their table, their faces flushed but full of joy.

As Clara engaged in small talk with Anne, she noticed her glancing toward Ethan with a hint of sadness in her demeanor.

"Aunt Anne, are you alright?" Clara asked, concerned.

"I just wish Ethan could be home more often. Look how happy the twins are today," Anne replied, a wistful smile on her lips.

"Aunt Anne, Ethan is out working for your better life," Clara reassured her.

Anne turned to Clara, smiling faintly. "I know he does it for us, but I miss having him around. Sometimes, when he’s away for too long, the twins don’t even recognize him."

Clara could imagine Anne’s feelings of longing and concern, missing her husband. After returning from their trip, she had heard Ethan mention he would leave again soon.

"Emily, you hadn’t considered how to transport the beef. That requires someone trustworthy—like Ethan," Emily suddenly chimed in with a playful wink.

Clara's mind clicked into gear. Yes! She could hire Ethan to handle the logistics, signing a confidentiality agreement to give him full responsibility. She could even share the ice-making method with him, allowing him to hire people for transportation.

This way, she wouldn’t be violating her agreement with her previous partner, as it would still be for her own use, keeping it under wraps. Plus, it would only be utilized for transport and wouldn’t compete with her previous partner’s ice business.

"Emily, you're brilliant!" Clara exclaimed, elated.

Anne, puzzled by their conversation, leaned in for an explanation. Clara clarified the plan, and soon Anne was beaming with delight.
