**A Winter's Resilience**

Once the rain paused, Clara Joy found herself unexpectedly wealthier, with an extra seventeen hundred dollars. It seemed like some people had a knack for making money effortlessly.

As night fell, Clara decided against visiting her friend, opting instead to learn what Shuqing and Yan had picked up during the day. The three were progressing equally well in their martial arts training, almost as if they were siblings.

On December 28th, a heavy snowfall covered everything, laying thick snow on the roads. Today, they planned a trip to town, not to work but to shop for New Year’s supplies.

This was their first New Year in this unfamiliar place, and although they missed their old friend, at least they had each other. This New Year felt more vibrant than any they’d celebrated before.

Although Clara valued earning money, she decided to take a break for the festivities. They didn’t borrow the village chief’s cart this time. Like most villagers, they carried backpacks and walked to town, avoiding the icy roads.

Chatting and laughing, they greeted familiar faces along the way. Once in town, they first sold the handmade pouches Song had crafted. Then, the shopping began.

With money in hand, Clara didn’t hold back. They bought clothes, pastries, and cakes, enjoying every moment. By afternoon, their shopping was complete.

Their final stop was at the butcher shop Clara often visited. “Here for New Year’s shopping?” the butcher, Mr. Smith, greeted them warmly.

“Yes, Mr. Smith! Happy New Year in advance!” Clara beamed.

“Thank you! How much meat do you need today?”

“I’d like to buy a whole pig. Could you deliver it to my house?” Clara asked, her excitement evident.

Mr. Smith was surprised but advised, “It’s winter, so the meat won’t spoil quickly, but you might want to consider buying just a few dozen pounds instead.”

Clara appreciated his concern and reassured him, “I have a way to preserve it. Don’t worry!”

Seeing Clara’s determination, Mr. Smith agreed. “I’ll deliver it once the roads are less icy.”

Clara thanked him and requested a few more pig’s feet and intestines. Back home, the girls organized their purchases and tidied up the kitchen.

Just as they finished, Mr. Smith arrived with the pig. He had gotten lost and brought some villagers along for directions.

“Wow, Clara, your family must be doing well to buy a whole pig!” one villager commented.

“Who else in the village can afford this much meat at once?” another added, raising eyebrows.

Clara and her friends were used to the village gossip. “Our business is our own. Let’s mind our own,” Clara said, paying Mr. Smith and closing the gate.

They divided the meat, planning to cure half and make sausages with the rest. After marinating, they were too tired to cook, so they snacked on treats instead.

On December 29th, Clara and her friends spent the day making sausages, hanging them to smoke. The cured meat needed more time to marinate.

That night, Clara was awakened by a faint noise, sensing danger. She noticed the roof shaking, ready to collapse. Quickly, she woke the others, and they escaped just before the house crumbled.

Wrapped in blankets, they endured the cold night, watching the snow continue to fall.

The next morning, their neighbor, Mrs. Smith, noticed the deep snow and hurried over. “Clara! Is everything okay?”

“Our house collapsed last night,” Clara explained.

“Why didn’t you come to me? You spent the night outside?” Mrs. Smith asked, concerned.

“Don’t worry, we managed with blankets and some martial arts practice,” Shuqing said with a playful shrug.

“Come to my house!” Mrs. Smith insisted, leading them back and warming them by the fire.

Some sausages were damaged, which saddened Clara and her friends. They explained to Mrs. Smith they wouldn’t stay, leaving only Song with her.

Though puzzled by their plans, Mrs. Smith trusted they’d be fine. Clara and her friends, wrapped in blankets with food, headed to a nearby cave.

They couldn’t bring Song along as they planned to train in the cave, close to their master, taking advantage of the time.

The snow continued beyond New Year’s, heavier each day. Clara and her friends stayed in the cave for a month, only venturing out for supplies.

Their martial arts skills improved significantly, though people outside were worried about their absence.

...

“Your internal energy is strong now. Choose weapons that suit you and continue practicing,” their master instructed.

“Master, I want to learn to fly!” Clara exclaimed eagerly.

“Once you choose your weapons, I’ll teach you the skill,” their master replied.

By February 6th, they mastered the new skill, and the snow finally stopped. Ready to rejoin the world, they planned to visit town.

“Ding! Rewarding host with a Dragon Whip,” Clara’s system announced.

Clara admired the whip in her hand, thrilled. It was sleek and silvery, with spikes that appeared when extended but disappeared when coiled, blending seamlessly with her outfit.
