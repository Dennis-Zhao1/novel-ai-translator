**Trouble Maker**

"It's all your fault for speaking out of turn! How did I end up with such a headstrong daughter?" Mrs. Smith scolded, her voice filled with frustration as she turned to her daughter, Ivy.

"Mom, I was just being honest," Ivy replied, covering her face and holding back tears, yet her voice remained steady.

Seeing Ivy dare to stand up for herself, Mrs. Smith raised her hand again, but Clara Joy quickly stepped forward and gently intervened.

Mrs. Smith's hand stopped mid-air, and she turned, her anger now directed at Clara. "You think you can just step in like that? Just wait until I deal with you!"

"I regret nothing about having you, but you're testing my patience," she continued, her words harsh and cutting.

As she reached out again, someone caught her hand before she could lash out.

"Ah!"

Emma, the neighbor, stepped in, her expression unimpressed. "Let go! Let go! I can handle my own daughter!" Mrs. Smith cried, her voice tinged with pain.

"You're aiming at Ivy, but it looks more like you're targeting Clara. Do you really think we're pushovers?" Clara's voice was firm, yet calm.

Internally, Clara felt a sense of triumph. She was showing the community that they might be a group of women, but they were not to be underestimated.

With a gentle but firm twist, Clara dislocated Mrs. Smith's shoulder, earning a gasp from the onlookers.

"Ah! You've hurt me!"

"Help! My arm is broken!"

"You little brats, you're all useless!"

"Relax, it's just a dislocation," Clara said, dusting off her hands and signaling to her sister. "Ivy, get the cash."

"On it!" Ivy replied cheerfully, despite the situation.

"Aunt Smith, here's three hundred dollars to cover your medical expenses. Take it easy and get some rest," Clara added with a smirk, knowing Mrs. Smith would have to lay off her usual behavior for a while.

The neighbors, silent witnesses to the drama, were torn. Should they pity Mrs. Smith? She had started the trouble, and now she was both in pain and compensated for her injury. Yet the message was clear: the Joy family was not to be messed with.

Ivy watched her mother leave with the money, her face showing a mix of relief and indifference.

"Thanks, big sister," Ivy said softly.

"No need to thank me. I didn't help you; I just took the chance to stop someone from wasting our time," Clara replied, her tone light but sincere.

But Ivy knew that, despite many ways to handle her mother's outbursts, dislocating her shoulder meant she wouldn't be able to hit anyone for a long time.

"Well, I still appreciate it," Ivy said with a small smile, ignoring her swollen cheek.

Clara's awkwardness drew a chuckle from Emma, who was watching.

After Ivy left, Emma didn’t question Clara’s actions; she chalked it up to divine intervention or the natural order of things.

The entire incident had wasted nearly an hour.

Yesterday, after coming down from the mountains, Ivy had gone to town to sell some homegrown herbs, while Clara and Emma had climbed back up, resulting in a bounty of chestnuts and apples at home.

Ivy washed the apples and chestnuts while Clara and Emma prepped them for cooking. Meanwhile, Clara was busy making apple dumplings and sweetened chestnuts. Occasionally, Ivy would tend to the fire, and whenever Clara felt exhausted, Emma would step in to help, following her lead.

By the time they finished processing everything, it was already late afternoon. They had been so engrossed in their work that they hadn't eaten lunch, only snacking on a few chestnuts and apples during quick breaks.

Emma felt especially conscious of using their precious sugar during these times.

After a short rest, the three of them, except for Clara, who went to make dinner, began wrapping the chestnuts and apples in paper, one pound per package.

Perhaps due to their exhaustion, they all slept deeply that night.

As a result, they woke up late, and when Sam arrived with the truck, the Joy family had yet to have breakfast.

Concerned about losing their spot at the market, Ivy and Clara decided to head to town to buy some supplies.

Emma and Clara stayed behind to weigh the chestnuts and apples that Sam and Ivy had picked and processed the previous day.

When they reached the county, the market was already bustling. In a less-than-ideal spot, Ivy set up a table she had brought from home, covering it with a vibrant cloth. Sam helped unload the goods before heading off to find extra work, planning to return at noon.

This way, he could earn a bit more; Ivy had offered him twenty dollars a day, and with some side work, he could make thirty in total.

Ivy and Clara Joy set up their packages of sweetened chestnuts and apples on the table, opening one of each to attract customers.

"Come get your sugar-glazed chestnuts and snow-dusted apples! Our sweetened chestnuts are sticky and fragrant, and the apples are the perfect balance of sweet and tart!"

"Don't miss out! It's our first day selling, so we have specials! One bag of sweetened chestnuts for seven dollars, two for thirteen, and one bag of sugar-coated apples for eight dollars, two for fifteen! The more you buy, the more you save!"

Ivy called out enthusiastically, while Clara handled the sales and transactions.

After selling a few bags, a jovial middle-aged man passing by chuckled at her pitch.

"Young lady, apples are usually cheaper than chestnuts this time of year; why are yours priced higher?"

Ivy smiled warmly at him, noticing the crowd gathering. She mentally praised herself for preparing a response.

"Sir, don't laugh! Come take a closer look; our apples are genuinely covered in sugar. Just taste one, and you'll see how delightful they are!" she explained with a grin.

"Wow, they really are sugar-coated! With the price of sugar these days, your apples aren't overpriced at all. Did you say one bag for eight dollars and two for fifteen?"

"That's right, Sir! The more you buy, the more you save!"

"Alright, I'll take two bags of apples."

"Sir, wait! You should try our chestnuts too! They're fragrant and sticky, with sugar that leaves your mouth sweet!"

"Alright, young lady, pack me two bags of chestnuts! Just the aroma is making me hungry, and with your sister's description, my stomach is already growling!"

Clara quickly handed over the chestnuts and took the man's money, smiling warmly.

Though usually quiet and serious, Clara knew how to engage with customers.

"Wow, these chestnuts are really delicious! So fragrant!" the man exclaimed after tasting them. "Totally worth the money..."

His last words were drowned out by the eager crowd pressing forward to buy more.
