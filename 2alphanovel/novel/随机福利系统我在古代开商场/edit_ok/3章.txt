**The Living Bride?**

"Clara, is it really hot?" The old village chief, Mr. Thompson, stepped forward, trying to mask his fear with a brave face.

"Mr. Thompson, it really is hot," Clara Joy answered confidently, facing the villagers. "Everyone, don’t be afraid. Look, they all have shadows. You can come closer and touch them."

Encouraged by Clara's words, some curious villagers cautiously approached. After confirming with the sisters one by one, they collectively breathed a sigh of relief.

“But you clearly stopped breathing! How could you come back to life?” one villager exclaimed.

“We don’t know either. We just met a very powerful person. He said we three sisters are blessed and shouldn’t go to the beyond so early. Then he waved his hand, and when we opened our eyes again, we found ourselves back in the world of the living.”

“Was there someone standing next to that person dressed in black and white?” another asked.

Clara Joy touched her nose, blinked her eyes, and earnestly replied, “I do remember there being someone, right, Emily, Sophie?” 

Emily and Sophie nodded in agreement. “I saw them too.”

“No wonder you seem different this time you woke up; you must have received guidance from a higher power. Surviving a great ordeal surely brings blessings. You sisters will definitely have better days ahead,” Mr. Thompson said, waving his hand to hush the villagers’ chatter.

“Thank you for your kind words, Mr. Thompson,” the sisters said politely.

The old village chief smiled, convinced even more by Clara Joy’s sincerity.

“Ah, so you all were just fooling me, trying to scare me on purpose,” at that moment, Mary Collins finally snapped back to reality and jumped up from the ground, pointing at Clara Joy and the others accusingly.

Seeing this, Mrs. Smith regretted it immensely. How could she have let the children fool their mother? She had no idea how they would deal with their mother’s wrath now.

“Grandma, we only did this out of respect for you. As soon as we emerged, you called us ghosts, and we didn’t dare defy you, so we had to admit it,” Clara Joy said, looking genuinely hurt.

“Mrs. Green, since your kids are alive, our engagement is off. Please return the betrothal money, and we will leave.” Just as Mary Collins was about to explode, she was stopped in her tracks by Mrs. Jenkins' firm words.

The Jenkins family’s arrangement was not much different from marrying the living. They paid the bride price, consulted someone about auspicious dates, and while they didn’t carry the actual bride, they brought along something precious that belonged to the deceased.

Mentioning money, Mary Collins stammered, unable to speak.

“Mr. Green, the children are alive; you cannot proceed with your plans. Fortunately, the Jenkins family’s elder is magnanimous. Just return the money and find a suitable match for your daughters later,” Mr. Thompson couldn’t bear to see Mary Collins’ greed and feared she would make another reckless decision.

Mary Collins glared at the village chief with resentment, patting her purse, unwilling to part with the money.

“Mom, I have a plan...” John leaned closer and whispered in Mary Collins’ ear.

“I wonder what bad idea you’re concocting now,” Sophie pouted.

Clara Joy and Emily also wore expressions of impatience, growing increasingly wary.

“Alright, then I’ll trouble Mrs. Jenkins. I’ll send you off, and the money is with me. I’ll give it to you shortly,” John said, and Mary Collins’ expression brightened instantly.

After the Jenkins family left, the villagers gradually dispersed, but the story of the sisters returning from the dead lingered in everyone’s minds, becoming a topic of conversation over meals.

“Three sisters, be careful when you get home. I can see that your aunt is up to something again,” Clara’s friend, Olivia, said with concern, wishing she could take the three sisters home with her.

Clara Joy patted Olivia, “We’ll be cautious. You should head back now; otherwise, your mom will scold you again.”

Olivia nodded reluctantly, but she felt a sense of relief inside — her good friend was back.

John and Tom glanced at Clara Joy and the others before silently returning home, needing to think about how to manage Mary Collins’ temper later!

Sarah, seeing everyone had left, finally approached Clara Joy and her sisters, “Have you thought about what I mentioned last time? The children are growing every day, and who knows what kind of match your mother will find for them.”

Sarah sighed. In the past, when her friend had brought this up, she always defended her mother, believing that despite her mother’s rough demeanor toward the children, she did care for them deep down.

But after this incident, she realized too late that her mother only had eyes for her sons and grandsons.

“How do you expect us to live if we move out? We have no land or fields, and with the weather turning cold, where will we stay?” Sarah’s face was clouded with worry.

Clara Joy was determined. “Mom, we’re hard-working people. If we move out, it might be tough, but we won’t starve. I really don’t want to stay at Grandma’s house anymore,” she pleaded.

The sisters had skills; Clara Joy was confident they could make a living, but she didn’t want to drag along those who took advantage of them.

“I’ll think about it some more.”

“Is Mom trying to have us face the same fate again? Have you forgotten why we were in danger last time?” Emily said coldly.

Sarah was instantly agitated when she heard this. “How could I forget? It was them punishing our family, forbidding us from eating. You were so hungry that you went into the woods looking for food and got poisoned by toxic mushrooms. Eldest daughter, I won’t let that happen again. I will protect you all!”

Seeing Emily’s impatience, Clara Joy quickly intervened. Sarah, as the mother of three children, had it hard enough. Her reluctance to leave was because she feared they wouldn’t have enough to eat or stay warm.

“Mom, but what if Grandma wants to marry you off again? Arranged by parents, matchmakers — how can you refuse? What happens when you leave, and Grandma marries us off or sells us without a second thought?”

“Grandma wouldn’t do that, right?”

Once Sarah said this, the three sisters looked at her with disbelief, deepening her inner guilt.

Seeing that Sarah was still hesitating despite everything that had been said, Clara Joy decided to say no more. Perhaps, in her mother’s view, this was just because they had died; that was why Mary Collins was acting this way. But Clara Joy believed Mary Collins wouldn’t let it go so easily. All it would take was another opportunity, and her mother would surely make a firm decision.

“Oh, isn’t this the person even the Grim Reaper won’t take? Finally willing to come back? Are you done with the chores at home? Don’t you want to eat dinner tonight?” 

“Aunt, you should think about how you’re going to deal with the time you pushed Grandma out to take the blame!”

“What did you say? You want to marry a living person to our Third Master?” Over there, Mrs. Jenkins almost stumbled in shock at Mary Collins' words.
