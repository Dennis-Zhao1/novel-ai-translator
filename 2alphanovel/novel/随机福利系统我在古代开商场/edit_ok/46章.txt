**Finding Trouble**

"Jessica, come on out here!"

"Why won't you let us work on the field? We're all neighbors. Even if something happened before, can't we move past it?"

Outside Mrs. Smith's house, a crowd had gathered, voices rising in frustration. But nobody dared to step inside; they just stood on the front lawn, shouting.

Jessica frowned as she watched from the window. Every time these folks showed up, it was the same song and dance. She already knew her answer, yet they persisted in making a scene.

Jessica followed Mr. Johnson outside to address the crowd.

"Quiet down!"

"We just want to know why Jessica won't let us use the land."

Standing beside Mr. Johnson, Jessica calmly faced the speaker.

"Because I don't want to," she replied simply.

"How can you be like this? Sure, I caused some trouble before, but that was ages ago. We're neighbors; can't you let bygones be bygones?"

"That's just how I am. If you're not happy with it, then..." Jessica paused for effect, her voice carrying a hint of challenge.

"Come on, don't take it personally. Let us work the land, and we'll do a good job," one person interjected, hoping to appeal to her better nature.

"I wasn't finished. If you're upset, that's your problem. It's my property, and I choose what to do with it."

Jessica found their persistence tiresome.

The crowd exchanged glances, taken aback by Jessica's bluntness, but unsure how to respond.

"Jessica, please have some sympathy. I'm raising a child on my own, and it's really tough. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you before."

As the group fell silent, a woman stepped forward, her child clinging to her side. Her plea was met with Jessica's unyielding gaze.

"Auntie, I'm sorry, but my land is accounted for. If I stretch it further, it won't serve anyone well."

Yet, the woman persisted, pulling her child closer.

Sensing an attempt to leverage sympathy, Jessica stepped back.

"Don't come any closer. I'm firm on this."

Suddenly, the child burst into tears, and the woman followed suit, tears streaming down her face.

"Look at how upset my child is. I'm alone, and it's hard to provide..."

"Jessica, you're an adult. Can't you leave the past behind?" another voice urged.

Jessica noticed the woman subtly pinching her child to provoke tears.

"I'll even kneel if that's what it takes!" she cried, her desperation palpable.

As the woman knelt, she accidentally tugged her child down with her, causing him to fall and faint.

Jessica observed the child, who seemed undernourished, while the woman appeared quite healthy.

"Someone call a doctor!" Mr. Johnson urged the crowd.

Jessica, who had medical knowledge, held back. She didn't want to get embroiled in this mess.

The doctor arrived quickly. As he examined the boy, he inadvertently rolled up a sleeve, revealing numerous bruises.

"This child is malnourished and suffering from internal injuries."

At this revelation, eyes turned to the woman.

"I—I don't know how this happened," she stammered, her facade slipping.

"Ah, my child, you always fight me about eating. Now look, you've fainted from hunger. And these injuries... how could I not notice? Please wake up and tell everyone," she implored, a hint of panic in her voice.

"Stop shaking him! If you keep that up, he might not recover," Jessica interjected, unable to remain silent.

"Jessica, how can you curse my son like that? He's just a child..." the woman protested.

"Uh, Auntie, maybe you should start acting like you care for him," Jessica pointedly remarked.

The woman's eyes darted around, realizing the crowd's scrutiny.

"Doctor, please help my child. He's all I've got. I'll do whatever it takes to make sure he recovers," she pleaded.

"Mr. Johnson, I think she's lying. I saw her pinch him earlier," Jessica couldn't help but alert him.

As for how the community would address this, Jessica had no concern. She only hoped the incident would lead to a better life for that little boy.

While the focus was on the boy and his mother, Jessica quietly slipped away.

"Hey, welcome back," called out Emily as soon as Jessica returned to her yard.

"You've learned another word! Great job, Emily!" Jessica praised her younger sister.

"Teach, teach," Emily pointed at Sarah, their other sister.

"I know Sarah's been teaching you."

"How'd it go? Everything okay?" Sarah asked Jessica, looking up from her work.

Sarah had been busy at home, honing her culinary skills and compiling recipes for a cookbook. She wanted to streamline training for new hires at the café they planned to open.

"It was fine, but some folks just love stirring up trouble," Jessica sighed, her frustration evident.

Seeing Jessica's frown, Sarah pulled a chair over and sat next to her.

"Come here, let me give you a shoulder rub."

Jessica relaxed and leaned her head closer, appreciating the gesture.

"You said you’d let us handle things! But here you are, running yourself ragged."

"Tomorrow, you're staying home. Just rest," Sarah insisted, her concern growing.

"Alright, I like this. It feels rewarding," Jessica admitted.

But Sarah couldn't hold back her emotions, tears welling up.

"Seeing you so busy every day breaks my heart. With our older sister away, you're left managing everything. Look at you—you're getting so thin."
