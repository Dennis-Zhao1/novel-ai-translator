**Clara Joy's Thoughts**

The next morning, as Clara Joy stretched and got out of bed, a soft, mechanical voice echoed in her mind.  
“Ding! Rewarding the host with a twenty-year-old ginseng root.”  

“What’s up with you? You look like you've seen a ghost,” said Emily, noticing Clara Joy's distant gaze at the wall.  
Mia waved a hand in front of Clara Joy's face when she didn't respond.  
“I just got a ginseng root from the system,” Clara Joy finally snapped back to reality and explained.  
When the system first appeared, she had immediately confided in her two best friends. They had been through thick and thin together for over a decade in her previous life, and she trusted them completely. Keeping it a secret would have been pointless—they would have figured it out anyway, leading to unnecessary tension.  

“Seriously?”  
Clara Joy nodded and, with a thought, commanded the system to deliver the item. Suddenly, a pristine ginseng root appeared in her hand.  
“Wow, it's really a ginseng root! This is incredible!” Mia exclaimed in surprise.  

“Why are you girls whispering up there? Come down for breakfast!” Mrs. Smith called from the kitchen as she walked past the doorway.  
Emily and Mia instinctively moved to shield Clara Joy from view.  
“We’ll be right down!” Mia replied cheerfully.  

Mrs. Smith didn’t notice anything unusual, just reminded them to hurry and left.  
Mia patted her chest, still a bit shaken.  
“Let’s not redeem any more rewards at home; what if we get caught?” Emily said seriously.  

Clara Joy pulled out the ginseng she had hastily hidden in her blankets, her heart sinking.  
Two of its roots were broken.  
“Oh no~ This is going to cost me a fortune,” Clara Joy lamented as she cradled the ginseng in her arms.  

“Don’t worry, host. I can repair it. Also, I have a storage space. Once you open it, you can store anything except living creatures. Would you like me to repair the ginseng and open the storage space?” the system’s sweet voice chimed in.  
Clara Joy’s expression brightened as she wiped away her tears and grinned.  
“Absolutely, repair it! But about the storage space—if I put things in there, you’re not going to run off with them, are you?” Clara Joy teased, feeling her spirits lift.  

“Absolutely not! You can trust me, master.”  
“Alright then, I was just joking. Please open the storage space for me.” After the system explained everything thoroughly, Clara Joy felt less wary of it.  

“What’s going on? You suddenly look so happy,” Emily asked, quickly slipping on her jacket.  
“I can repair the ginseng, and I also got an extra storage space!”

Later in the morning, Ethan returned with Logan, but both were reluctant to stay for lunch.  
In the afternoon, Sarah came by with her backpack to gather Clara Joy and the others.  
Most of the household chores were done by Logan, with Mrs. Smith and Ethan lending a hand. If not for waiting for Sarah, Clara Joy and her friends would have already headed up the mountain.  

Upon hearing Sarah’s voice, the three of them grabbed a backpack borrowed from Ethan’s house and set off.  
On the way, Sarah noticed they were heading toward the inner areas of the mountain. Although she felt uneasy, she held back from asking.  
“Don’t worry; my sister and the others found some food around the inner areas yesterday,” Clara Joy reassured her, sensing her tension.  

“Will there be wild animals near the inner area?” Sarah asked quietly.  
“No, the wild animals are deeper within the inner area,” Clara Joy replied confidently, as the system kept assuring her of safety.  
Indeed, she had intended to test if the system could help her detect danger once they arrived on the mountain. To her delight, it worked and even highlighted beneficial items within a two-hundred-meter radius around her. Clara Joy couldn't help but marvel at how useful this system was.  

“Straight ahead, one hundred meters to the left, there’s a hundred-year-old He Shou Wu. Beneficial for the host, beneficial for the host, beneficial for the host.”  
“Beneficial, beneficial, beneficial for the host.”  
“Beneficial, beneficial, host deviation.”  

After Clara Joy ignored several items, the system seemed to get stuck, endlessly repeating its message.  
With no other choice, she had to dig up the He Shou Wu.  
“What is this thing?” Sarah asked, looking at the long, arm-sized tuber Clara Joy had unearthed, puzzled.  
“This is a medicinal herb called He Shou Wu. It can be sold for money,” Clara Joy explained simply.  

She was troubled. If she took this back to the village and then to town to sell, it would surely attract unwanted attention. But if she didn’t, people would start to suspect her family’s financial need.  
“After we take it back and sell it, I can handle any trouble that comes up,” Emily said.  
Clara Joy nodded in agreement.  
Meanwhile, Sarah had already been pulled away by Mia to dig for sweet potatoes.  

The system continued to chatter about where to find good items, which annoyed Clara Joy. She promptly muted it.  
She realized she couldn’t rely entirely on the system to get rich; otherwise, her life would lose its meaning. By simply following the system’s instructions and gathering herbs all day, she could become wealthier than many, yet it would make her seem like a puppet of the system.  
Besides, she didn’t want to attract unwanted attention—she didn’t want to be seen as some lucky charm.  
“From now on, don’t give me such hints again,” Clara Joy commanded in her mind.  

The four of them worked together—one digging sweet potatoes, two gathering chestnuts, and one picking hawthorn berries. Before long, their backpacks were full, and they split everything equally among themselves.  
On the way down the mountain, Sarah hesitated, wanting to say something.  
“Big sister, second sister, third sister, you said you want to make money with these things, right? Can I sell what’s in my backpack too? Just let me know when, and I’ll put the money with you.”  

Clara Joy immediately recognized that Sarah was a girl with plans; she wouldn’t act like other girls of this era. But if she suddenly wanted to save money, it surely meant something else was happening.  
“What’s going on?”  
“I overheard my mom and dad discussing marrying me off to the old official in town next year and saving money for my brother’s education.”  
Clara Joy frowned.  
“Your mom is awful,” Mia commented.  
“You don’t need to worry. Since you mentioned making money, I’ve already got a plan. I’ll save up more money and buy my freedom, cutting ties with them.”  
“Since you’ve thought it through, we’ll definitely help you,” Clara Joy assured her.  
But even as best friends, they had to keep accounts clear.  
“To be honest, we plan to process what we gather further and will need some raw materials and labor, so it’s hard to calculate the price. How about we weigh it and pay you by the pound? Whatever you gather, you can sell to us later.”  
“That sounds fair; clear and straightforward.”  
“However, we don’t know how much to charge yet, so I can’t tell you how much per pound. Also, I don’t have any money on me right now; I’ll owe you for this backpack.”  
“I trust you!”  

So, Sarah’s backpack made its way to Clara Joy’s house, with just a little left for her mother as a gesture.  
At home, Logan had already finished all the tasks he could manage, and outside Clara Joy’s house, they had even erected a fence woven from bamboo.
