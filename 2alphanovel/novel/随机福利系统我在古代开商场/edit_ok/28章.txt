**Time Dilation Space**

Clara Joy stepped outside, ready to drive her car once again. As she arrived at her destination, she closed her eyes and felt herself transported, only to return the same way she came.

However, Clara couldn’t quite grasp the difference—it was baffling why she seemed to arrive at a completely different place all of a sudden. She had posed her questions to her mentor, Ethan Jade, but he merely shrugged, admitting he had no idea either. It seemed like it might be a mechanism left behind by people from long ago.

Before Clara could reach home, she spotted two heads peeking out from behind a bush.

“Do you think Clara’s run into trouble?” one of them asked anxiously.

“No way,” replied the other, nudging her companion. “She’s back! If she took any longer, some folks would be getting frantic.”

Clara chuckled softly, “I was worried too. Ever since mom passed, it’s just the three of us relying on each other in this strange world.”

She pulled her younger sister, Joy, into a comforting embrace and recounted the incredible day she had experienced.

“Really? You can learn martial arts now? That’s amazing! Does that mean I could be like those superheroes on TV?” Joy’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

Clara exchanged a knowing look with her. “That takes a lot of time, and we don’t even know if we’re cut out for it.”

After waiting for their friend, Sarah, to return for dinner, the three of them washed up and got ready for bed. Sarah sat on the bed, stitching a pouch under a small lamp, determined to earn money quickly to pay off a loan.

The next day, Clara informed Sarah that from now on, they wouldn’t be heading to the fields—they’d let the two of them handle it and sell whatever they could gather.

During lunchtime, the trio picked up some sandwiches in town, then took a bus back home. Clara led the way to Ethan’s place afterward.

They walked into an expansive room, traversed a narrow hallway, and eventually arrived at a scenic overlook.

“Wow, this place is stunning!” Joy exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder.

“Ethan,” Clara and her sisters said in unison as they greeted him.

One of them held two wild chickens or rabbits in her hands—this was a stroke of luck from Clara’s last trip when they had gathered these in the woods and placed them in their cooler. Inside, they wouldn’t spoil and would remain fresh. They hadn’t sold them before due to a lack of opportunity.

“Home doesn’t have much, so we brought these wild creatures as a token of respect and to nourish your family,” Clara explained.

Ethan couldn’t help but smirk at the sight of the sisters. To them, this bounty of wild game might have taken considerable effort to gather on their own. Even he sometimes struggled to catch this much in a whole day.

“Dear, the kids must be standing for ages. Aren't you going to invite them to sit?” Ethan's wife, Lisa, said softly.

“Alright, you can all sit. No need for such formalities. You need to eat well too; you don’t have to bring everything to us,” Ethan said, noticing the varied expressions on their faces.

“To be honest, Ethan, our mom passed away not long ago. Now it’s just the three of us holding each other up, along with a close friend who lives with us,” Clara replied, her tone somber.

Ethan was puzzled, but Lisa’s expression turned to one of compassion.

“Did those people come after you again?”

“No, our mom was harmed by someone and it was tragic,” Clara said, her voice trembling slightly.

“Oh, poor children! Come here. From now on, you’ll have us to support you,” Lisa said, her voice soothing and gentle.

Joy instantly warmed to this kind, gentle woman, feeling her heart lift a bit, even though it still hurt.

Clara requested Ethan to bring Lisa into the house. After checking her pulse, she gently squeezed her legs, realizing there was no sensation at all.

“I’ll use the herbal remedy I made with my mentor’s techniques,” Clara thought, but fearing Ethan's concern, she took a sip first before offering a bowl for Lisa to drink.

Then, she proceeded to give her a massage and acupuncture treatment.

Once everything was done, Lisa’s tears flowed freely.

“Honey, I can feel my legs tingling,” she wept.

“This herbal remedy works wonders,” Clara mused in her mind.

“It’s unfortunate your mom passed before you could return; otherwise, even her last breath could have been saved,” Clara's inner voice trailed off, sensing her sorrow.

Ethan, still in disbelief about Lisa’s reaction, asked, “You really feel something?”

Lisa nodded through her tears, “I do, honey.”

Despite Clara and her sisters being present, Ethan couldn’t contain his joy, lifting Lisa and spinning her around.

“Maybe you should put her down before you hurt her legs again,” Clara chuckled.

“Oh right, right! Sit down and rest.”

“Since today is the first treatment, it’s normal to see quick results. Progress might slow down later,” Clara said honestly.

“It’s okay. As long as I can heal, I’m willing to wait no matter how long it takes,” Lisa replied, her face streaked with tears yet determined.

“Alright, Ethan, you should go teach the kids martial arts now,” she urged.

Ethan carried Lisa out again, placing a light blanket over her legs to keep her warm.

“Remember to massage her legs as well,” Clara reminded.

They were then taken to a clearing beside the garden by Ethan.

First, he had them build their stamina starting from the basics—every morning running a few laps around the block and practicing their stances.

That day, since there wasn’t enough time for running, they only did stances.

From that day on, Clara and her sisters made it a point to wake up an hour early each morning to run laps around the neighborhood.

At first, Sarah was puzzled, but seeing the sisters’ increasing vitality, she decided to join them.

However, regarding the incident with Thirteen, the three kept silent. They didn’t want anyone disturbing the peace of their mentor and his wife.

“Ding! Time Dilation Space awarded to the host.”

“What does that mean?” Clara was confused and inquired.

“It means that within the designated space, time will pass differently—one day outside equals three months inside. But the person doesn’t age, which is greatly beneficial for your learning. You can use it anytime and anywhere, but the space cannot exceed one hundred square meters.”

Clara was stunned. She adored this feature even more now. For them to learn martial arts quickly and see results, this time dilation space was incredibly useful.

That night, after Sarah had gone to sleep, Clara took Joy and Clara Joy into the yard to practice their martial arts.

As a result, after Ethan taught them new moves and how to cultivate their inner strength the previous day, they made significant progress the next day.

Their movements became fluid and refined, and their inner strength improved dramatically.

This led Ethan to question himself, often asking Lisa at night, “Are you sure a whole day has passed?”

Every time this happened, Lisa would gently pat Ethan’s head to check if he was feeling unwell.
