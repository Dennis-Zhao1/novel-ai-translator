**Ice Making with Nitre**

By the time Clara Joy and the others left, dusk had settled in, casting a warm glow over the bustling streets.

Clara had even taken the time to give Holly a makeover, toning down her stunning beauty to avoid unwanted attention.

Ethan Smith had accompanied Clara and the others to the inn. He went in first but soon returned to call for Clara.

“Today’s matter really depends on your help, Miss Clara.”

“It’s no trouble at all. It’s getting late, so you should head home, Ethan.”

After seeing Ethan off, Clara finally relaxed, letting her stiff smile fade away.

“Dealing with merchants is really exhausting,” she sighed.

“That Ethan Smith is a good person,” Lucy said, helping Clara massage her face.

“Third Sister, Second Sister, you’re finally back!” Lily appeared from somewhere, her smile brightening the room as she greeted Clara and Lucy.

Seeing Lily's pure smile felt refreshing to Clara, as if her soul had been cleansed.

She instructed Sam to call the innkeeper to bring two tables of food up to their room.

“For the next few days, you’ll have to share a room with Jenny. Also, don’t go out. Every time we eat, we’ll ask the innkeeper to bring the food to our room.”

Clara was certain that there were people from the Snow family nearby.

“Yes, I understand. Thank you, Miss Clara.”

With her worries gone, Holly's tranquil nature slowly began to shine through.

The next day, Clara took Sam and Jenny to the Smith family’s trading company by carriage.

Ethan had been waiting at the entrance early in the morning. When he spotted the approaching carriage, driven by Clara’s maid, he hurried over, calling for the staff inside to help take the carriage to the stable.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, Ethan.”

“I just arrived a little while ago.”

Clara was welcomed into a room at the trading company by Ethan.

Once they were seated, a staff member brought in tea.

“Young Master Smith, I’m a straightforward person, so let’s skip the pleasantries and discuss business directly,” Clara said, a gentle smile gracing her lips.

“Please let me know what seafood you need.”

“All kinds of crabs, shrimp, shellfish, squid, octopus, salmon, yellow croaker, ribbonfish, sole, sardines…”

“Some of these are relatively easy to keep alive, and when we transport them, we can load them with seawater, so they should still be alive by the time they reach you. However, some are prone to dying easily, especially in this hot weather, which could lead to spoilage,” Ethan explained.

“What about using ice?”

“The heat will cause it to melt. Even if we use ice for the departure from here, it will likely melt along the way.”

Clara paused for a moment, realizing that this was indeed a tricky problem.

“We could buy ice along the way, but that would be too expensive.”

“I understand.” Clara suddenly slapped the table, a spark of excitement lighting her eyes.

“Miss Clara?”

“Sorry, sorry! I just thought of a solution and got a bit too excited.”

“What solution?”

Clara hesitated; she couldn’t just give away such a valuable idea to the Smith family for free.

“I have a very simple method for ice making. This way, we can produce ice along the journey to preserve the goods, and the materials needed for the ice are not expensive.”

Ethan’s expression changed noticeably. If this method worked, they could earn significantly more money, surpassing the Snow family and quickly becoming the top business in this port town.

“Miss, is it true that you have this method?”

“Absolutely true.” Clara’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm.

“Miss Clara, could I purchase this method from you?”

“Sell it? That wouldn’t be worth it.”

“You should know how valuable this method is for your business. How much do you plan to pay?”

“Ten thousand dollars?”

There was no denying that the Smith family was indeed straightforward in their dealings; ten thousand dollars was no small sum.

However…

“Its value is much more than that. Just think about it: in summer, wealthy families here will need to buy ice…” Clara didn’t finish her sentence, but she was confident that Ethan would grasp the implication.

Ethan narrowed his eyes. This was clearly a goldmine.

“Fifteen thousand dollars.”

But Clara shook her head again.

“No sale; I want a share of the profits.”

“How does Miss Clara plan to do that?” At this point, Ethan realized Clara was not going to sell the ice-making method after all.

“You can handle the ice business, Ethan, and I won’t interfere. But I want thirty percent of the profits, along with thirty percent of the savings from buying ice when you deliver seafood to other merchants.”

“Although this method can earn a lot, Miss, you’re not involved in the operations. Am I not being a bit generous asking for thirty percent?”

“Not at all. Once the Smith family has more staff and expands the ice business across the country, there’s no doubt that the Smith family will be among the wealthiest in the port town, if not in the entire Southern States.”

Ethan was taken aback by Clara's words. He hadn’t thought that far ahead. But if Clara’s plan came to fruition, the Smith family really would rise to prominence.

“Miss Clara, even so, thirty percent is still too much. How about twenty percent?”

“Alright, deal.”

As soon as Ethan finished speaking, Clara immediately agreed.

At that moment, he realized Clara had been waiting for him to make an offer!

He felt a mix of helplessness and resignation.

“Now can you tell me how to produce the ice?”

“Not yet. We need to write a contract first,” Clara said, shaking her head with a knowing smile.

Ethan couldn’t help but chuckle at Clara’s shrewdness.

He called for a staff member nearby to fetch paper and ink.

“Can I tell you now?”

“Nitre ice-making.”

“Nitre?”

“Yes, Young Master, could you have someone find some nitre?”

“Of course.”

In less than fifteen minutes, Ethan’s staff returned with the nitre.

Clara then had them bring two basins, one large and one small, filling both with water, but the water level in the small basin was lower than in the large basin.

Next, Clara added an appropriate amount of nitre to the large basin. As the nitre met the water, it began to react rapidly, absorbing heat from the surroundings. Soon after, the water in the small basin gradually turned to ice.

Ethan watched in wide-eyed amazement as the scene unfolded before him. It was astonishingly simple.

“What do you think, Young Master? There seems to be significant business potential here.”

After a moment of calm, Ethan replied, “Indeed, there is potential. However, Miss Clara, the nitre ice-making method has two major drawbacks: the quantity of nitre required is considerable, and the ice cannot be formed into blocks.”

“This method is designed for wealthy families; who among the poor or ordinary families would need ice in the summer? Although it cannot form into blocks, it’s sufficient for transporting goods, and the ice can also be used for various cold drinks. Selling in the summer will surely yield significant profits,” Clara had already considered these points when devising the nitre ice-making method.

After all, the contract had already been signed!

“Alright, let’s put aside the nitre for now and focus on the seafood business, shall we?”

Ethan felt a mix of regret and anticipation in his heart, unsure whether he had come out ahead or behind in this deal, as his thoughts swirled around the prospects ahead.
