**Adapted Version**

Autumn looked up at Clara, who nodded with understanding.

“What we need now is to find our strength and keep moving forward. One day, we’ll have a chance to make things right,” Clara said with determination.

“But Banxia seems lost; she’s even talked about giving up,” Autumn replied, her concern evident.

Suddenly, a thought struck Autumn. “I’ve got something that might help her forget the pain,” she said, kneeling before Clara. “Please, let me give it to Banxia.”

“But if she forgets, she might lose the drive to face her challenges,” Clara warned gently.

“It’s okay. I’m her sister, and I can carry those memories for both of us. I just want her to be happy,” Autumn insisted.

Clara felt a swell of warmth at Autumn’s sincere words, reminded of her own beloved sisters.

The next day, Banxia seemed to have regained her lively spirit, chatting cheerfully with Clara. She still loved cooking, so Clara suggested Banxia join her kitchen team. Clara, already considering this, agreed with a smile.

Watching her sister return to her old self, Autumn felt a wave of gratitude. She was content with her new life, serving Clara with joy and a renewed sense of purpose.

The day was perfect for a picnic, and Clara’s family was eager to enjoy it. Clara and Banxia prepared an array of delicious dishes, including a roasted lamb for the occasion.

Once Ethan and Laney arrived, they headed to the nearby riverbank. Clara spread out a picnic blanket, and the women gathered, chatting and laughing.

Meanwhile, Ethan and Alex set up the grill. Autumn, Banxia, and Laney’s maid lit the charcoal and placed the lamb on the grill, basting it with Clara’s special sauce, which filled the air with a delightful aroma.

As they waited, Clara called Ethan and Laney over. “So, you’re heading out soon?”

“Yeah, I’m leaving the day after tomorrow. Can you keep an eye on things while I’m gone?” Ethan asked.

“Of course. Just make sure to stay safe. If my mom wasn’t so attached, I’d be right there with you,” Clara said with a hint of longing.

“No worries, you’re a big help from home. We’ll sort out your pay later,” Ethan replied with a grin.

“Just let me know where you need help, and I’ll pitch in free of charge,” Clara teased.

“Since your sister can’t come, having you here is more than enough,” Ethan said.

“Your sister’s a girl; it’s not always easy for her to travel. Besides, would you really leave Ethan all alone at home?” Clara joked.

Ethan fell silent, knowing he was there to support his grandfather.

Clara noticed her friends enjoying the food and decided to take a stroll by the riverbank. She wore a vibrant green dress, her hair flowing freely, simply held with a wooden clip. As she walked, the breeze played with her skirt, and she twirled, thinking of the new market she was planning to open.

Unbeknownst to her, this charming scene caught Ethan’s eye from the bridge.

“Master, are you looking at that woman?” a voice asked with disdain.

“She’s not just anyone; she once helped us,” Ethan’s friend said, his voice slightly hoarse.

“We did pay her well...” another voice chimed in.

“Enough, let’s move,” Ethan said, looking away.

Once they left, Clara glanced after them, shook her head, and returned to her friends.

As Autumn drove the horse cart home, she noticed some people at the door.

“Is this where Miss Clara Joy lives?” a messenger asked.

“Yes, it is,” Clara responded.

“Someone asked me to deliver this letter to her.”

Clara jumped off the cart, recognizing the emblem on the letter, her heart racing with excitement. She handed the messenger a tip. “I’m Clara Joy.”

“If you want to reply, send someone to the Changlai Inn by tomorrow afternoon,” the messenger instructed.

“It’s from my sister!” Clara exclaimed when she got inside.

Shu Yuqin saw the letter and couldn’t help but shout.

Clara opened it, reading the simple message: “Everything is well! I’ve settled in and am starting a workshop. I’m not sure when I’ll be back.”

“Why didn’t she write more? What about her projects? Doesn’t she miss us?” Shu Yuqin grumbled.

“Hey, there’s more on the back,” Autumn pointed out.

Clara turned the letter over to see: “And yes, I miss you!”

“That’s better,” Clara said, feeling reassured.

“Still, she needs to watch out for what we can’t see,” Shu Yuqin remarked, feeling somewhat comforted.

Meanwhile, their sister, Jenny, sat annoyed, glaring at the man beside her.

“Can you stop following me, Ethan?” she snapped.

“Jenny, I’m just here to make sure you’re safe,” Ethan replied sincerely.

Jenny rolled her eyes. Who knew bumping into him would lead to him shadowing her?

“We can protect her,” a girl beside Jenny offered.

“Just pretend I’m not here,” Ethan said casually.

“Ethan, don’t you have anything better to do?” Jenny asked pointedly.

Ethan paused before replying, “Winning your heart is my current mission.”

Jenny took a deep breath. Despite his persistence, he remained respectful.

“Are you planning to be a troublemaker, Ethan?” she teased.

Ethan glared at his friend behind him.

“No, I’ve never been interested in anyone before; he just gets ideas,” Ethan explained quickly.

“Master, how was I supposed to know Jenny’s different?” his friend protested.

Ignoring Ethan, Jenny walked ahead. Noticing he followed, she decided to let it go for now.

Back at home, Clara carefully stored the letter and, with Shu Yuqin, penned a response to Jenny. Once done, they gave some money to Autumn to deliver it to the Changlai Inn.
