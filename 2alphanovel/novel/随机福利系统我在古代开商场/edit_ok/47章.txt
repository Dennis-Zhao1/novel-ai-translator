**Fur and Feathers**

Clara Joy watched as tears streamed down her friend Sarah's face, unable to stop her own heart from racing with worry. The sight of Sarah's uncontrollable sobs made her anxious.

Beside them, Emily fumbled nervously, trying to wipe Sarah's tears away with her sleeve.

"I'm just… I'm just so worried about you! You're working too hard, and I’m afraid one day you’ll just collapse from exhaustion!" Emily said, her voice cracking with concern.

Clara’s hands froze mid-motion. 

“No, no! I promise I won’t collapse from exhaustion!” she reassured her friend, trying to put on a brave face.

“But I’m still scared you might! It would break my heart!” Sarah pouted, her expression a mix of distress and helplessness.

Clara hurriedly comforted her while dabbing at her tears. “You have to promise me you'll take a break tomorrow. Just relax at home.”

“Okay, okay! I promise! Just please stop crying, alright? Seeing you like this makes me want to cry too!” Clara pouted back.

In the end, Clara couldn’t manage to console Sarah, and instead found herself crying even louder than her friend. The weight of everything had been so exhausting for her. Why was she even doing all this?

The two girls held onto each other, sobbing heartily, while Emily desperately tried to console them, alternating between wiping one friend’s tears and then the other’s.

“Why don’t we just forget about becoming rich? We’re doing just fine this way,” Sarah suddenly suggested.

“No way! We absolutely must become successful! I’ve been working so hard for this, we can’t just throw it away!” Clara protested vehemently.

“Fine, I still want to make it big too. It’s just too exciting!” Sarah replied, her resolve softening.

“Can we cry for a little longer, and then promise not to cry anymore?” Clara comforted Sarah, sniffling back her own tears.

The next day, Clara found herself grounded at home by Sarah. Deep down, Sarah was genuinely worried about Clara wearing herself out—losing her best friend was not something she could bear.

“Today, you’re not allowed to do anything. Just lie here on the couch and relax,” Sarah insisted.

Clara looked at her friend, who kept bringing her snacks, and felt a rush of happiness.

Taking a rare break felt so comforting.

Clara cleared her mind, chatting with Sarah while occasionally giving Emily a few tips on conversation. She even took a long nap in the afternoon, only to find herself restless at night.

It seemed she just couldn't catch a break. Getting up, she decided to head to the backyard to practice her yoga.

Sarah, who hadn’t fallen asleep, heard the movement and got up too. She hadn’t practiced her yoga in a while and was feeling a bit behind.

“Hey, hey!” 

Suddenly, Emily appeared in the backyard, calling out to them.

“Emily, come on over!” Clara beckoned.

This was the perfect opportunity! Since Clara had some extra time today, she could show Emily a few yoga poses.

So, Clara taught Emily while Sarah practiced her poses. When the three of them grew tired, they would take a break and chat. There were even times when Clara would practice a new pose while Emily observed.

To Clara’s surprise, Emily could perfectly mimic their movements after watching them. It was an unexpected delight to discover that Emily had a natural talent for yoga that surpassed their own.

The next morning, all three woke up feeling refreshed. Clara had set the morning alarm just as the sun began to rise. Inside their little yoga sanctuary, they were oblivious to the passing of time, sometimes waking up standing in the backyard and other times still asleep.

With half of their tasks already completed, Clara let out a sigh of relief.

“Hey, Clara!” 

Clara heard someone calling her name and turned around, puzzled.

“Uncle Dan?” she asked, recognizing the voice.

“It’s me! I can’t believe you still remember me!” he chuckled.

“Of course! You were a regular at my food stall,” Clara replied, a smile spreading across her face.

Uncle Dan was a familiar face from when Clara had been selling hotdogs, often chatting with her while waiting for his order. He had even come back for several consecutive days for her food.

“I passed by here and saw you weren’t the one running the stall anymore. What a coincidence to see you here!” he remarked.

“That’s my cousin handling it now. I’ve moved on to something else,” Clara explained. “If you want to grab a hotdog, you can find them over there. The taste is still the same.”

“Are you planning to sell other kinds of food?” Uncle Dan inquired.

“Absolutely! We’re branching out into groceries, clothing, and snacks. When you pass by again, feel free to come check it out!” Clara said cheerfully.

Uncle Dan listened, imagining the bustling scene Clara described. 

“You’ve got a lot of ideas, Clara! It sounds like it will be quite the endeavor. But once it’s up and running, I’m sure it’ll be a hit.”

“Let’s hope so!” Clara said confidently.

Uncle Dan found it refreshing to meet such an open-minded young woman. Suddenly, he recalled the fine fabrics he had been keeping and got an idea.

“Hey, Clara, you mentioned wanting to open a clothing store. I have a batch of high-quality fabrics—would you be interested?”

Clara hadn’t anticipated discussing business on the street, but Uncle Dan’s offer sparked her interest.

“Let’s take a look at them.”

“Alright, follow me,” he said, leading her to a nearby warehouse. “This is where we’re staying. We travel everywhere to source goods. When we meet like-minded people, we rent this place together.”

Clara examined the fabrics; they were indeed of excellent quality. If made into jackets or dresses, they would be both stylish and comfortable.

But the price was a bit steep.

“You know how it is. Ordinary fabrics go for fifteen dollars a yard, while the high-quality ones are at least twenty-five—that’s the lowest I can offer.”

Clara understood that this was already a fair price, especially considering the heat of summer made it a slow season for sales, and traveling merchants like him were always anxious about unsold stock.

“Alright, Uncle Dan, I’ll take the entire batch.”

She requested Uncle Dan to help her transport the goods back to the fabric store, which had recently been renamed “City Threads Workshop.”

Summerling and Amy greeted Clara as she arrived, stepping forward to chat.

“How’s everything, Amy? Getting used to it?”

“I am! I’ve learned so much,” Amy replied, her face lighting up with genuine happiness, easing Clara’s worries.

“I brought a batch of goods to store in the back room for now since we won’t need them just yet.”

Summerling nodded, acknowledging her instructions.

Clara glanced around the workshop and noticed there weren’t enough people. “You can hire more if needed. I have other designs I want to pursue.”

She handed Summerling the designs and added, “If you need more space, just rent it. If money runs low, let me know.”

After giving her brief instructions, Clara followed Uncle Dan back.

Seeing Uncle Dan's companions had collected a lot of organic goods, Clara figured she could buy those too for her future store.

So, she informed them of her planned opening date so they could deliver the goods to her store when the time came.
