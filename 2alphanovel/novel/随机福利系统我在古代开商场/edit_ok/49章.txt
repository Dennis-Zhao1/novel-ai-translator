**The Two Sisters**

Today marked the fifth day of Clara Joy's preparations for her journey down south. She and her sister, Julia, decided to take a leisurely walk to see if there was anything else they needed for the trip. Since this was their first time traveling far in this era, being well-prepared was key to easing their anxieties. Also, it had been ages since the two of them had gone shopping together.

"Hey, sis, check it out! They’ve got candied apples! Let’s grab some!" Clara exclaimed with excitement.

"Absolutely!" Julia replied with a warm smile, her affection for her sister evident in her tone.

Nearby, their older brother, Ethan Jade, seemed preoccupied with something else entirely.

"Ethan, what’s caught your eye?" Clara noticed his distraction.

"Over there!" Ethan pointed, and following his gaze, Clara found herself staring at a scene she’d only ever seen dramatized on TV.

A group of people were being led in chains, treated like animals, as they were pulled along. Whenever one stumbled or dared to look up, the guards would lash out at them mercilessly.

"This is terrible," Ethan muttered, pulling Clara closer.

"This is the harsh reality we live in. It's not something we can easily change," Clara replied with a composed expression, though her heart ached at the sight.

"Come one, come all! Freshly arrived and at a bargain!" a vendor shouted, drawing the group closer to where Clara and her siblings stood.

"There are both men and women—take the attractive ones home to keep you company, and the others to help with chores."

The candied apples were taking a bit to finish, so Clara and her siblings lingered nearby, observing the scene. As more onlookers gathered, Clara’s eyes fell upon two young girls in the group of shackled individuals. Their scant clothing barely covered them, drawing the attention of many unsavory onlookers.

"Those poor girls. It’s as if they’re on display for everyone to ogle at," Julia said, her voice heavy with sympathy.

"I’ll take those two girls," a woman announced, striding forward with an air of confidence.

"We won’t be working in a brothel," one of the girls replied with a determined expression.

Clara raised an eyebrow, impressed by their dignity amidst such adversity.

"Well, they’ve got some fight in them! Just the kind my Madam Smith loves to train," the woman laughed.

"Alright, I’ll have them sent over to your place," the guard replied, grinning broadly.

In that moment, the girl who had spoken earlier kicked the man restraining her and landed a punch on Madam Smith as well. The other guards quickly rushed in to subdue her, but the girl stopped, no longer resisting.

"We’re slaves and can’t escape, but my sister and I refuse to go to a brothel. Do whatever you want with the others," she stated firmly, then tied herself back up.

"Hey, your candied apples are ready!" called out the shop owner, breaking the tension.

Clara, who wasn’t a big fan of sweets, took the treats and divided them between Julia and Ethan.

"Stay here for a minute," Clara said, her thoughts drifting back to the girl who had shown such resilience. She walked to a nearby fabric store and bought two rolls of cloth, then made her way back toward the group of slaves.

Madam Smith was still fuming, but despite being chained, the girl nimbly jumped up, delivering a couple of sharp kicks to the woman.

"This is outrageous! I’ll definitely tame you! You two girls stay put; I’m going to get help," Madam Smith said, storming off.

"Why waste your energy on them? Bringing them home will only cause you trouble. Besides, there are other girls who are quite pretty," Clara said, stepping out from the crowd with a smile directed at Madam Smith.

Madam Smith's eyes lit up at the sight of Clara. Noting her attire, she assumed Clara came from a well-off family. As a savvy businesswoman, she knew it was wise to avoid offending someone who might have influence.

"Are you vouching for them, young lady?"

"Not exactly! I’m thinking of you, Madam. Those two seem like troublemakers; they might pretend to behave but could cause issues later. Wouldn’t that be a loss for you?" Clara reasoned.

Madam Smith slapped her thigh, realizing Clara had a point. "You're right! The other girls are also decent."

"Alright! I, Madam Smith, am generous! I’ll let you two go this time," she announced, leaving to purchase other girls.

Once Madam Smith was out of sight, Clara stepped forward and quickly wrapped the two girls in the cloth she had bought.

"Will you come with me?" Clara asked, her voice gentle yet firm.

"As long as it’s not to a brothel, we’ll go anywhere. You don’t think we have complete freedom of choice, do you?" the girl who had spoken earlier replied, her tone sharp.

"Why not? I see that you have some impressive skills," Clara countered.

"We’re marked as slaves. Even if we leave, we can’t go far. But since we know martial arts, we can avoid doing those filthy jobs," the girl said, raising her chin defiantly.

"Fine, I’ll buy both of you," Clara declared, just as a sleazy man appeared beside her.

"I'll take those two girls! I love a challenge," he grinned, eyeing the girls with a lecherous gaze.

"Sir, my sister saw them first, so they’re going with her," Julia chimed in, suppressing her disgust for the man.

The man leered at Clara and Julia, stroking his clean-shaven chin. "Ladies, it’s not quite that simple. You haven’t even paid yet."

"How much for the two?" Clara asked the vendor.

"Thirty dollars for both," the vendor replied.

Clara frowned; that price was clearly inflated, taking advantage of the competition.

As she hesitated, the sleazy man's lackey stepped in front of her. "My boss already bought them. You have nothing to do with this."

The lackey had sized up Clara's appearance and decided she was unlikely to be from a wealthy family.

"First come, first served," Clara insisted, not willing to back down.

"Oh, today I’ll make sure I come last, and what are you going to do about it?" the sleazy man stepped closer to Clara, invading her personal space.

Unable to suppress her irritation, Clara raised her hand and delivered a sharp slap across his face.
