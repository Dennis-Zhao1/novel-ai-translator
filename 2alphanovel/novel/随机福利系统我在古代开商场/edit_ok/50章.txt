**A Tragic Encounter**

"Are you really bold enough to hit me?" the sleazy man exclaimed, clutching his cheek in disbelief.

Clara Joy calmly wiped her hand with a tissue, a slight smile playing on her lips. She hadn't even finished explaining the situation to Ethan Jade, but sometimes a little self-defense was necessary, especially against someone so shameless.

"You're actually complaining about me messing up your face?" Clara retorted. "Guys, let's teach her a lesson!" The sleazy man gestured to his minions, anger twisting his features.

Instantly, Clara's friends, Sarah and Jessica, were by her side. The three of them made quick work of the minions, leaving them sprawled on the ground, groaning.

"Youâ€”you just wait!" the sleazy man stuttered, his bravado crumbling as he turned tail and fled, abandoning his lackeys.

"That man's connected to some big names around here! You might have trouble coming your way," a bystander warned.

Clara fell silent. She recalled Emma telling her that the local sheriff had no siblings, and she was the only child, which meant they spoiled her quite a bit.

"So, can I buy those people?" Clara asked the trader.

"Of course, of course!" the trader replied eagerly.

"How much?"

The trader hesitated, but seeing Clara's determination, he relented. "Two hundred dollars will do."

Clara didn't haggle. She reached into her purse and handed over the money without a second thought. "Now, give me the contracts."

With the contracts in hand and the bindings removed, Clara led the two girls away.

Not long after, they ran into the sleazy man again.

"That's her! She attacked me on the street! Arrest her!" He pointed at Clara, shrinking back as he spoke.

"Miss Clara?" the officer asked, eyeing her curiously.

"Yes, I did hit him, but he was being awful," Clara replied, crossing her arms defiantly.

The officer nodded, then turned to the sleazy man. "Mr. Smith, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Miss Clara is respected in our community and has helped out on several occasions."

Hearing this, the sleazy man, despite his resentment towards Clara, had no choice but to back down.

"Ah, it's all just a misunderstanding!" he stammered, forcing a smile.

"Miss Clara, I'm truly sorry for the disturbance," the officer said, bowing slightly.

"It's fine," Clara replied simply.

There were some things she needed to discuss with Emma in person.

Once they returned home, Clara prepared hot water for the two girls and gave them some of her own clothes to change into after their baths.

"Thank you, Miss Clara," the older sister said gratefully.

"What are your names?"

"We don't have any. Could you name us, please?" the older sister asked, pulling her younger sibling, Jessica, to kneel on the ground.

Clara moved to help them up, but they instinctively recoiled.

"Stand up," she instructed, retracting her hand.

Clara realized she had no idea what these sisters had been through.

"Then let the older sister be named Sarah and the younger, Jessica," Clara decided after some thought, opting for names she found pleasant.

"Thank you for the names, Miss Clara." The sisters knelt again in gratitude.

Clara let them, knowing they needed to adapt to their new life and find comfort in small rituals.

"Clara, you got into trouble this morning. Why didn't you let the officers come find us?" Emma's voice preceded her entrance.

Clara smiled at her, surprised Emma wasn't with Ethan Jade this time.

"It was just a minor issue, and I've already taken care of it," Clara said, settling into a chair with a smile.

"I heard from the officer that it was my cousin causing trouble. He's a handful, always stirring up trouble," Emma replied, clearly annoyed.

"I'm okay, but I'll warn you, he's been telling people he's your father's brother around town," Clara cautioned.

"If that's the case, I'll have a word with my dad," Emma said, her tone suddenly serious.

Clara nodded. It was always a pleasure talking to smart people who understood without needing everything spelled out.

Because Sarah and Jessica were injured, Clara decided to postpone their trip south.

"Ding! Reward for Clara: a gift card," a familiar voice chimed in Clara's mind after a long silence.

"I thought you vanished!" Clara replied, lounging on her bed and chatting with the voice.

"Not at all! The system just took a while to decide on a reward," the voice, soft and sweet, explained.

"Ah, ah, go away! You all go away!" Clara suddenly exclaimed, leaping from her bed and racing towards Sarah and Jessica's room.

"Jessica! I'm here! Don't be scared!" she called as she opened the door, finding Sarah cradling Jessica, comforting her.

At that moment, Lucy also arrived, and Alex stood outside the door.

Clara and Lucy sat beside Sarah, quietly offering their support.

It took over an hour for Jessica to calm down, after which Clara gave her something to help her sleep.

Seeing Sarah curled up, looking lost, Clara firmly pulled her into her embrace. "Don't worry, we're here now."

As those words left her lips, Sarah couldn't hold back any longer and burst into tears.

"It's all my fault! I should have protected my sister better! It's all my fault!" she sobbed.

"If I hadn't gone out that day to plead for help, my sister wouldn't have been hurt!" she cried.

Clara was taken aback; she hadn't realized the depth of their trauma. No wonder Jessica seemed so quiet and fearful.

"After that, they used my sister to threaten me. Because of that, I lost my own innocence too. I hate them! I hate them!" Sarah clutched her hair in frustration.

Clara held her hand tightly, wrapping her arms around her, while Lucy comforted Sarah's back.

"It's okay, it's okay," Clara whispered soothingly.

"I want to stop them from ever hurting anyone again!" Sarah's eyes locked onto Clara's with fierce determination.

Clara paused before responding firmly, "Alright."

"Aren't you going to ask who they are?" Sarah pressed.

"It doesn't matter who they are; anyone who does something like that is despicable and deserves to be stopped," Clara said, her tone sharp and resolute.

Sarah felt a jolt of surprise. Ever since the incident, not even their relatives had stood up for them; no one had spoken on their behalf. To think that someone would actually understand...

"They are the children of a powerful politician."

Clara and Lucy exchanged a glance.

"Micro, do these two sisters hold any hostility towards me?"

"No, in fact, they feel grateful towards you for understanding them. Their anger is justified," the voice replied.

Clara sighed with relief.

"Unfortunately, our enemies are also connected to the politician," she murmured.

Although Clara's friends had never openly discussed the people who had harmed them, they had long regarded them as enemies. Even if those people never harmed them again, they would never forgive them.
