**Goddess**

Ethan, Lily, and Sam were having a great time drinking, and Ivy chose not to interrupt them. Eventually, all three of them ended up sprawled on the table, completely drunk. That night, Ivy's family stayed at Ethan's home. After waking up and having breakfast, it was only then that Ivy broached the topic of hiring Ethan.

When Ethan heard about the generous salary with a promise of future raises, he was overjoyed. Ivy decided to leave Lily and Sam at Ethan's place while she took Quinn and Charlie back to the heart of Willow Creek with him.

As they arrived in Willow Creek, it was already afternoon, and Ivy noticed that something felt off. As soon as they entered, they saw crowds of people lining both sides of the street, blocking their way and instructing them to park their car off to the side.

Stepping out, Ivy noticed Ethan counting on his fingers, seemingly lost in thought. After a moment, he finally looked up and said, "Today’s the day of the Snake God ceremony held by the Ridgewood Tribe."

“Ethan, what does that mean?” Ivy asked, puzzled.

“I’m not entirely sure about all the details, but I know the Ridgewood Tribe keeps a giant snake, and every year at the start of July, they choose someone to offer as a sacrifice to the Snake God, hoping it will bring prosperity to their community.”

This wasn’t a sacrifice in the traditional sense; it was simply a way to feed the chosen person to the snake. In that moment, Ivy realized just how ancient the tradition was. Standing in the crowd, she followed everyone’s gaze to the center of the road, slowly realizing that someone was approaching.

In front of her, there were six individuals flanking a carriage, which was notably taller and uncovered. Atop it sat a woman clad in wedding attire, her hands crossed in front of her. On either side of the carriage stood four attendants, followed by a group of twenty people trailing behind them. The procession seemed to stretch endlessly.

When the crowd caught sight of the approaching figures, they erupted in excitement, chanting, “Goddess! Goddess!” 

Ivy couldn’t understand what they were saying and looked back at Ethan. 

“They’re calling her the Goddess,” he translated.

Ivy felt a wave of sympathy for the girl atop the carriage; becoming a goddess seemed to bring only this moment of fleeting glory. As the procession moved at a snail's pace, Ivy found herself losing interest in the spectacle.

The crowd began to surge forward, drawn by the movement of the goddess. Ivy had no way to push through the throng and didn’t want to draw attention to herself, so she remained within the ebb and flow of the crowd.

After what felt like an eternity, Ivy followed the mass to a grassy plain. In the distance, she spotted a cave, surrounded by four individuals. They had set up a platform in front of the cave, draped with colorful cloth.

When they arrived, the attendants climbed onto the carriage, setting up a triangular ladder to assist the goddess down. Once she was on the platform, aided by her attendants, the goddess bowed towards the cave and then knelt in reverence. 

At that moment, four men stepped forward, lifting the goddess and making their way toward the cave’s entrance. As they approached, Ivy caught sight of a massive python extending its head from the cave, peering out.

“Looks like the goddess wet herself,” one of the men carrying her remarked suddenly.

“Looks like the goddess wet herself,” Ethan translated, his expression slightly uncomfortable.

The individuals at the cave’s entrance turned to the men carrying the goddess, speaking to them in a haughty manner. 

“Since she’s soiled herself, the Snake God wouldn’t be pleased. Take her back!” Ethan interpreted.

As if to confirm the man’s words, the snake at the cave’s entrance also seemed to react, pulling its head back slightly before retreating into the cave.

“The Snake God is angry,” the crowd erupted again.

“They say the Snake God is angry.”

Once the spectacle concluded, Ivy found her way to an inn to rest, the sun already setting. After spending the entire afternoon in the sun, her face felt hot and flushed. Little did she know, she had already caught someone’s attention.

Having finished her meal, she asked the innkeeper to send two basins of ice to her room, preparing for an early night’s rest.

“Danger! Be careful, Ivy!” 

Ivy’s eyes flew open as she scanned her surroundings.

“Quinn! Quinn!” 

No one answered her, so she got out of bed, slipped on her shoes, and made her way to the common area, where she found Quinn sleeping soundly on the couch.

She shook Quinn gently, but there was no response. When she tried to shake her again, she found her arms felt heavy and unresponsive, her vision blurring dangerously.

When Ivy awoke again, she realized she had been taken to a tent, her limbs bound with ropes. She struggled against her restraints, but she found that she had no strength left in her body.

At that moment, a woman entered, looking just like one of the attendants from the previous day who had stood beside the goddess. She began chattering away in a language Ivy couldn’t comprehend, her brow furrowing in frustration.

Adding to her anxiety, she felt utterly powerless; her internal energy and martial skills were inaccessible to her. After the woman finished talking, she exited, only to return shortly after with three girls carrying various items.

As they entered, the last girl shut the door behind them. They proceeded to dress Ivy in garments identical to those worn by the goddess the day before and applied makeup, covering her face with a veil.

Was she becoming the goddess herself?

Once everything was ready, Ivy watched helplessly as they untied her, but she still found herself unable to move.

Then, four men walked in and lifted her up, carrying her outside. 

How was she going to escape this predicament? Ivy felt a rising sense of urgency.

“Acne medicine,” the system spoke into her mind.

With great effort, she raised her hand, but her strength still hadn’t returned. Many eyes were on her, leaving no opportunity for action.

They carried her to the carriage, where an attendant climbed the ladder first, and together with another, they helped Ivy onto the highest point.

Afterward, everyone left, disappearing from sight.

Seizing her chance, Ivy pulled out the acne medicine. It took a monumental effort to get the pill into her mouth.

Just as she completed this task, the others returned, taking their places once more.

Though her face was veiled, she could still see a bit when she lowered her head.

Slowly, she caught sight of the crowd by the roadside and heard their enthusiastic cheers.

Just then, a gust of wind swept by, lifting her veil momentarily, causing two figures in the crowd to freeze in surprise.

“Brother, that’s the girl!” one exclaimed.

“Don’t rush,” the other replied.

After a while, Ivy felt an intense itch spreading across her body, and she pulled her sleeves back slightly.

Small, dense pimples were beginning to form.

At that moment, someone in the crowd shouted something in the dialect of the prairie tribes.

Ivy didn’t understand the words, but she sensed that after the shout, the carriage came to a halt.

Someone climbed the ladder again, pulling her sleeves back further.

Another round of chattering ensued, and Ivy felt the carriage turn around.

They returned to the tent, where Ivy was unceremoniously tossed aside. No one paid her any further attention.

This was the fate of the goddess: when she was no longer needed, she was discarded.

Ivy lifted her hand, still feeling weak.

“Miss! Hurry, I’ll carry you!”
