**Chapter Title: Clara and the Village**

“Honestly, I didn’t do anything wrong,” Clara Joy insisted, her face a picture of innocence. She knew she might ruffle some feathers today.

“Mrs. Smith, I’ve brought you some fish from our family’s catch. Don’t be shy!” Clara said cheerfully as she accepted two skewered fish from her sister, ignoring the curious glances from the neighbors around her.

Mrs. Smith took the fish with a grateful nod. “You’re a kind girl.”

“Mrs. Smith, I noticed there are many good folks in our town. We’ve caught quite a bit from the river today, and I think we should share it. Let’s give one fish to each family that couldn’t make it today. What do you think?” Clara suggested, her voice brimming with enthusiasm.

Mrs. Smith studied Clara for a moment, recognizing her cleverness and thoughtfulness. Clara understood that living in a small town meant nurturing good relationships, but today’s events had helped her determine which families were worth her effort and which were not.

The neighbors listening to Clara’s words felt a twinge of regret, yet as the saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. In the days to come, they would watch those absent families thrive, deepening their remorse.

Later that afternoon, Clara had to face the consequences because her family had made a statement, leaving her no choice. However, she informed those who caused trouble at her home that she wouldn’t be accepting anything from them in the future. She then delivered a fish to each of the families that hadn’t come, while the rest she entrusted to her friend Lisa to sell in town.

Grace picked up the money from selling her hawthorn and chestnuts and rushed to help Clara and her sisters clean up. Since they couldn’t rely solely on the previous day’s meager sales, they needed to produce more.

Noticing it was getting late, Grace figured it was unlikely anyone else would come to deliver goods. She turned to Clara and said, “You did the right thing today. While it’s important to maintain good relations in the community, not everyone is worth your time.”

“Grace, why are you defending her? She’s gotten too big for her britches. She offended so many people today without needing my help,” Rose interjected disapprovingly.

“And besides, she didn’t even give a fish to her grandmother’s family,” Rose added.

Realizing why Clara and her sisters looked upset, Grace finally understood the situation. “What can those people do for you? If you offend them, so be it. And don’t forget that your grandma’s family has cut ties with you. Why should the children give them anything?” She tugged at Rose’s sleeve, giving her a knowing glance.

Following Grace’s gaze, Rose finally noticed the sisters’ emotional turmoil. “But they are still my parents and brother,” Rose insisted, still unwilling to let go of her ties.

“Mom, let’s just go back to Grandma’s,” suggested Ellie, voicing the sisters’ feelings.

Rose was left in disbelief; her children didn’t want her anymore. “Ellie?” she called out to her closest child, Sophie, after the incident.

“Mom, let’s go. We don’t want a mom who doesn’t care about us. If you have feelings for them, then you should go back!” Sophie replied firmly.

“To be honest, none of us will ever have anything to do with Grandma’s family again. We might even consider them our enemies. If you can’t be heartless about it, then we’ll manage ourselves,” Clara added, her words heavy with finality.

The sisters had initially thought Rose was ready to mend their relationship, but it became clear that she still saw her ties to Grandma’s family as a bond, despite the severance.

Feeling lost, Rose stepped outside, contemplating a visit back to Grandma’s house.

“If you want to go back, then go. But just know, the children’s hearts will never heal,” Grace warned as she accompanied her out, her tone laced with frustration.

Clara and her sisters ignored Rose, each focused on their own tasks. It wasn’t until late at night that Rose returned, her eyes brimming with tears.

She hoped to find comfort from Clara and her sisters, but they pretended not to notice her entrance. Clara thought, *If you come back, we’ll support you, but we won’t be close anymore. You won’t know anything about our lives from now on.*

After selling hawthorn and chestnuts for a while, Clara’s earnings were impressive. With no special circumstances, they could earn over nine hundred dollars a day after expenses.

During this time, Clara also visited the Johnson family twice to check on Mr. Johnson. After two more acupuncture sessions and medication, she noticed a significant improvement in his facial droop and his ability to speak more clearly.

Feeling the chill of Clara and her sisters’ coldness, Rose tried to change, attempting various ways to show care for them each day.

One day, while Clara and Sophie were selling their goods, they spotted the old lady Jones across the street.

“Ma'am, those are two of the three girls I mentioned last time,” Mrs. Brown reported.

The old lady Jones’s expression remained unchanged, but her grip on Mrs. Brown’s arm tightened noticeably.

“They are the ones who ruined my son’s chances of marrying; they deserve to be buried together,” she hissed.

Mrs. Brown understood that her mistress was taking out her frustrations on the girls.

“Ma'am, do you want to go over?” she asked cautiously.

“Let’s go see. I want to find out what kind of people the grim reaper wouldn’t take, yet they were lucky enough to be saved,” the old lady Jones said, lifting her chin defiantly.

“Ma'am, may I interest you in some chestnuts and hawthorn?” Clara asked politely, her smile unwavering.

“You know me?” the old lady Jones retorted, surprise flickering across her face.

“I’ve seen Mrs. Jones before,” Clara replied, her inner thoughts not so kind, *so I know you’re just a heartless old hag.*

“You wouldn’t have to suffer if you were smart enough to join my son in living a life of luxury,” the old lady Jones said with a patronizing tone.

Clara was taken aback by her bluntness. The old lady didn’t know that it was actually Mr. Johnson who saved them, and she was referring to the first time they had ‘come back from the brink.’

However, Clara couldn’t fathom that the old lady harbored such deep-seated resentment towards them for reasons beyond their control.

With a forced smile, Clara replied, “It’s not our fault that the grim reaper wouldn’t take us. There’s nothing we can do about it.”

“Hmph, sharp-tongued!”

Clara was stunned. *I simply stated the truth; how is that being sharp-tongued?*

“Two girls out and about, how shameless can you be?” the old lady Jones spat suddenly.

“Why do you look down on women, Ma'am? We’re just like most women on this street, trying to make a living. What’s so shameful about it?” Clara replied loudly, drawing the attention of many passersby.

“Isn’t that Mrs. Jones? I thought she was the kindest person, yet here she is saying such things. We women have no choice but to go out and do business!” some women selling goods chimed in.

“Oh dear, how did you hear that? Our old lady was just concerned about how tired you girls must be from selling. She wanted to help you buy some things!” Mrs. Brown quickly interjected, realizing the old lady’s reputation was at stake.

“Oh, is that so? I must have misheard. My apologies, Ma'am,” Clara feigned confusion.

“Hmm, it’s alright. Just make sure not to wrongly accuse anyone next time. Here’s fifty dollars; that should be enough to cover what I need,” the old lady Jones said, her tone condescendingly generous.
