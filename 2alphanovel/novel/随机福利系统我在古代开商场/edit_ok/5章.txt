**Random Welfare System**

Clara felt a rush of embarrassment as she listened intently to the muffled voices coming from the room, all thanks to Ethan’s insistence that she eavesdrop on the situation.

“What did you hear?” Clara asked eagerly, almost bouncing on her heels as soon as Ethan lay back on the bed.

“Shh, keep it down. We don’t want to wake Mom,” Clara said, tugging at her friend's sleeve with a worried expression.

Ethan recounted every word he had overheard, including the more scandalous bits at the end.

Clara couldn't help but chuckle, “I didn’t expect those two to still be so... enthusiastic at their age.”

“Do we really need to think about that right now? We need a plan. Or should we tell Mom? Maybe she’ll let us move out,” Clara said anxiously, biting her fingernails. But as she looked at her two friends, she realized they were far less concerned about the situation.

Clara and Ethan exchanged knowing glances, then turned to Clara with a look of gentle exasperation. After all their adventures together, how was she still so naive?

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Clara asked, perplexed.

“If we tell Mom, do you think she’ll believe us?” Clara asked patiently.

Clara recalled how their mother had praised Mrs. Smith for making them each an omelet, going on about her kindness and care.

“She wouldn’t believe us,” Clara finally admitted.

“Exactly! She’d probably think we’re just trying to get out of chores. Even if she did believe us, it’s not like she’d resolve it by tomorrow,” Clara added.

“What do we do then?” Clara frowned. “I finally have a mom, and I don’t want to lose her so soon.”

“We turn the tables on them,” Clara and Ethan said in unison.

“Oh, okay.” Clara nodded, realizing she’d have to trust her friends. After all, their bond had weathered many storms.

“Are those two really... you know? Aren’t they over fifty?” Clara asked, pushing aside her worries and diving into gossip.

“Why not listen in? They’re probably in a passionate mood right now; we’ll definitely hear something,” Clara suggested.

“Oh no, I’d rather not. Ugh, I’m so tired. I need to sleep,” Clara said, her cheeks flushed as she pulled the blanket over herself.

Moments later, Clara poked her head out from under the covers. “Do you think Grandma made us omelets tonight because we might be getting some money? Maybe that’s why she’s in a good mood?”

“Good thinking! You’re so clever!” Clara said, her spirits lifting because of her insight.

Clara smiled in the dark. “I just thought of it now.”

In their new surroundings, the three friends had a hard time sleeping. When Mrs. Smith woke up, they stirred too.

“Get up! There’s a lot of work to do today. If you perform well, maybe Grandma will make you omelets again tonight,” she encouraged.

“Mom, you get up first. We want to sleep a little longer,” Clara mumbled, still half-asleep.

“That’s not happening. I know you’re tired, but if you don’t bring back the pig feed before breakfast, Grandma will get mad,” Mrs. Smith insisted.

“She won’t be mad today. You go ahead, Mom. We’ll sleep a bit more,” Clara added, feeling confident that Mrs. Smith wouldn’t be angry on their last day, especially not when money was involved.

Plus, she figured that any guilt Mrs. Smith might feel, or the fear that they might come back as vengeful spirits, would ensure they were treated well today. They didn’t need to work like beasts this time; they could afford to relax and enjoy a meal.

Mrs. Smith looked at the clock, realizing she couldn’t put it off any longer. She quickly got on with her chores, finishing her work before tackling the kids' responsibilities.

“Mom, why are you up so early today?” she asked, only to be startled by Mrs. Smith’s sudden appearance.

“Hmm, where are the kids?” Mrs. Smith asked, looking bright and chipper.

Mrs. Smith’s heart raced, unsure how to respond.

“They’re probably still asleep. It’s okay; after everything that happened yesterday, the kids are tired. Don’t wake them. Let them rest. I’ll ask your sister-in-law to buy a chicken to make sure they get a little extra nourishment,” Mrs. Smith said.

Mrs. Smith raised her head in disbelief.

“What? Do I look like I’m joking?”

“No, no! Thank you for understanding, Mom. Thank you!” she replied, overwhelmed with gratitude.

“Today, do less work and spend more time with them,” Mrs. Smith instructed.

“Understood!” she replied cheerfully.

At the breakfast table, she chewed on the bagel Mrs. Smith had set aside for her, glancing at her mother-in-law, who seemed ready to say something but held back.

“Take more. Make sure the kids each get a bagel and an omelet,” Mrs. Smith said, and instantly, everyone except Ethan dropped their jaws in shock.

Mr. Smith looked at Mrs. Smith in confusion. Seeing her in such a good mood, he quickly pulled on Mrs. Taylor’s sleeve, who was about to speak.

Mrs. Taylor usually followed her son’s lead, and even though she was itching to say something, she kept quiet.

“Grandma, the money from the bracelets still has some left over from the crafts my sister made. Can I take a bagel for her?” Mr. Smith suggested.

Hearing his voice made Mrs. Smith even happier. She glanced at Clara, who was dutifully sipping her thin porridge next to Mrs. Taylor, and found her more pleasing to the eye than usual. She picked up the smallest bagel and handed it over.

Seeing the big house's theatrics and glancing at her own daughters, Mrs. Smith, who wasn’t fond of them but disliked the big house even more, felt a twinge of irritation.

“Dear, Clara is also making crafts to sell money for you. Can’t we give them a bagel too?” she asked, her mood darkening.

“Wait until they’ve actually sold something. They’ve done hardly any work. What right do they have to eat bagels?” Mrs. Smith snapped back.

“Grandma, we won't eat. My sister and I are full. We’re going to go gather firewood now,” Clara said, hastily finishing the rest of her porridge and pulling Clara to rush out.

After eating the food Mrs. Smith had brought, the three friends split up and left. Thanks to Mrs. Smith's earlier words, she didn’t hold them back.

Based on her memories, Clara knew that Alex was by the river, so she headed there, while Ethan took Clara to the mountains to plan their future escape.

“Alex.”

“Three sisters! Why are you here at this hour?” Alex asked, surprised.

“Because my grandma will secretly send us away tonight, so she’s letting us off the hook today,” Clara explained.

“She’s not planning to marry you off to the He family, is she? It makes sense. She seemed suddenly in a good mood last night and wanted to send Grandma He off. She must be scheming something. How did you find out? Oh no, what are you going to do? That’s a death sentence! You should run!” Alex said, panicking.

“We’re not running. I came to ask for your help,” Clara said earnestly.

“What do you need?” Alex asked.

“Help me deliver this letter to Mr. Young in the county. He’s the only one who can save us,” Clara replied, her eyes filled with hope.

Without a second thought, Alex agreed, determined to deliver the letter. After all, Clara was her best friend who had saved her life.

“What’s this for? You need money for me to help you?” Alex inquired.

“It’s just to explain to your mom. You need a reason to go to the county, right?” Clara replied.

“Ding! Random welfare system activated...”

“Host has thought of a solution to the current dilemma. Reward: A set of silver needles...”

“Automatically distributed to you. Please proceed to a secluded area...”
