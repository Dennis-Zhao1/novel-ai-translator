**The Love of Clara Joy**

"Cousin, you really need to stop talking like that! Think about it, officials handle cases impartially. How could they possibly be swayed by money?" Clara Joy exclaimed, feigning shock, her voice carrying a playful edge.

Ethan Jade glared at Clara with frustration simmering beneath his calm facade. The idea of using money to help their grandmother had come up before, but they'd been too discreet, allowing no one else to overhear.

"How dare you suggest bribery as a means to an end!" Sarah Lane wiped away her tears, her anger flaring as she shot Ethan a fiery glance. "The current sheriff is known for his integrity. Are you sure you want to make such accusations?"

"Go to the town hall and let them know someone is questioning the sheriff's reputation," Sarah instructed her friend, her voice steady and determined.

"I only mentioned it in a moment of panic; why are you holding onto it?" Ethan defended himself, trying to maintain his composure.

"Cousin, I forgot to mention, this is the sheriff's daughter. Even if it was said in a moment of panic, it still casts a shadow on the sheriff's reputation, and everyone heard it," Clara added, a triumphant glint in her eyes.

Ethan felt a wave of nausea. He hadn’t realized Clara was surrounded by the sheriff's daughter and her friends. If he got caught now, it could ruin his career.

Clara decided to ignore Ethan's predicament, wiping away her remaining tears and mustering a smile. "I'm sorry, everyone, for the commotion; it must have held up your shopping. Here's what I'll do: anyone who buys something today will get an extra treat on the house."

The crowd, moved by Clara's resilience and the promise of an extra dish, quickly decided to make purchases.

A few days later, Clara informed Ethan that she was planning to find a location rich in flowers to prepare for their future market. In her past life, Clara had been a beautician and had learned to make her own skincare products. Given Ethan's interest in opening a market, Clara felt it was time to start preparing.

The day after hearing the news, Ethan collected the wild goods they had gathered from the hills and headed to the neighboring town to sell them, rather than setting up a stall that day.

After selling the wild goods for a handsome sum and adding some savings of his own, he handed the total to Clara.

Before Clara left, she, Ethan, and Susan Young visited the home of Ivy Lark.

Ivy's leg, which had been treated daily for over a month, was fully healed. Upon seeing them, she hurried over, her face lighting up with warmth.

"Why did you buy so many things? We have everything we need here; just take care of yourselves," Ivy said, her gentle demeanor radiating kindness.

"Since you and the master live here and rarely go out, we wanted to bring you some treats," Susan replied, hugging Ivy's arm affectionately.

"I miss you and the master too. Go put the things away first," Ivy urged.

Mark Lark saw the girls putting down their items and playfully challenged them to a sparring match. They quickly scattered, engaging in a friendly bout. In the end, it was a good, even match.

"Looks like you haven't been slacking," Mark commented with a chuckle.

"Of course not! We practice every day," Clara assured him, grinning.

Indeed, the trio woke early each morning to jog around their yard and train, and in the evenings, they practiced martial arts in the courtyard while Samantha, the youngest, slept.

"Now that Ethan has a whip, have you two decided on your weapons?" Mark asked Clara and Susan.

"I want to use a dagger."

"I'll use a sword."

"Great! I have manuals for swordplay and close-range dagger techniques. You'll need to find your own weapons, though," Mark instructed.

Clara and Susan quickly thanked him.

"As for you, Ethan, I don’t have a manual specifically for whips, so you’ll need to find one yourself," Mark added.

Once they settled on their weapons, the three girls chatted with Mark and Ivy. Upon learning that Clara was planning to venture elsewhere, they repeatedly reminded her to be cautious.

After sharing a meal, Ivy called the girls back as they were leaving, disappearing into her room briefly before returning.

"This is all the money Mark and I have saved. I know you all have your own dreams, and this is the least we can do to help," she said, offering them a pouch.

"We can't accept this," they protested.

But Ivy ignored their refusals, insisting on placing it in their hands.

"A teacher is like a parent for life. In our hearts, you are our children," Mark said gently, unable to bear Ivy’s sadness.

With tears welling in their eyes, the three girls accepted the gift solemnly, bowing to Ivy and Mark in gratitude.

Ivy tenderly patted their heads. "I know you have your ambitions, but remember to take care of yourselves and come back to visit often."

"Yes," Ethan agreed, struck by an idea. "What if you and Mark came with us?"

Ivy paused, her expression thoughtful. "Your master and I prefer the tranquility of our life here. We just want you to visit us when you can," she replied with a smile.

The sun rises with work and sets with rest, with loved ones by one’s side. Ethan thought that if she grew old, she would wish to live like that with someone she loved.

Mark wrapped an arm around Ivy's waist, teasingly casting a sidelong glance at the three girls. "It's probably best if you don’t come back too often; don’t disturb our little world together."

Just as Ethan and the others were moved, Mark’s words lightened the mood.

Before they left, Mark advised them, "There's a wise old man in the inner circle of Long Mountain. If you can earn his trust, he will be a loyal companion."

……

Ivy ended up giving each of the three girls a generous sum.

Ethan had no idea how long it took for Mark and Ivy to save that much, and her gratitude surged within her.

However, Clara and Susan each took out a portion and handed it to Ethan. "You'll need this for buying land, construction, decoration, and other expenses."

Ethan accepted it without hesitation, knowing their bond didn’t require further words.

Thanks to Ivy's support, Ethan’s plans for opening the market were set into motion.

She brought Susan to find Charlie Parker, sharing with him the recipe for a popular dish so that Charlie’s family could sell it themselves.

Initially, Charlie and his wife firmly refused, but after Ethan explained her intentions and with her insistence, they finally agreed.

Ethan and her friends always remembered how Charlie's family had helped them, and even though things had changed, that kindness lingered on.
