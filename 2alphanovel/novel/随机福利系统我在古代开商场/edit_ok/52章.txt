**Preparations Before Departure**

The day before heading south, Clara Joy returned to her hometown.

"Clara's back!" When Mr. Smith saw Clara approaching, he immediately called out, "Clara's back!"

"Mr. Smith, you can just call me Clara," she replied with a warm smile.

"No way, you're the boss around here."

Clara chuckled softly, realizing that arguing further about titles would be useless. 

She glanced around, noting the progress. "I see half the land is already set up with greenhouses. Now, you can go buy seeds and get everyone started. We don’t want to waste the land that's ready."

"That's exactly what I was thinking. Even if you didn't come today, I was planning to find you tomorrow," Mr. Smith responded, nodding in agreement.

"What kind of seeds are you planning to get?"

"All sorts, really. Vegetables, and maybe some watermelon and cantaloupe."

"Sounds perfect," Clara approved. "I’ll handle it tomorrow."

"Oh, by the way, we handed out the first batch of wages yesterday. Let me grab the ledger for you."

Clara nodded. Trust was important, but she knew clarity prevented future misunderstandings. As she flipped through the ledger, she saw everything was meticulously recorded, with notes on each expense.

"Didn't you take anything for yourself, Mr. Smith?"

Mr. Smith's face flushed slightly. "Well, you never mentioned how much I should take, so..."

"That's my oversight. Since you oversee the work, buy supplies, and pay the workers, how about $500 a month?"

Mr. Smith looked at her in disbelief before accepting the offer graciously. "That's more than fair. I actually feel it's a bit much."

With noon approaching, Clara figured Mrs. Johnson and her husband would be back from the market. She bid Mr. Smith goodbye and headed over to Mrs. Johnson's house, arriving just as they returned.

"Clara, you're back!"

"How's business been, Mrs. Johnson?"

While setting a stool outside, Mrs. Johnson replied, "It's steady, though it slows a bit now that it's warmer. We make about $50 to $60 a day."

"But honestly, we're quite satisfied. We used to earn in a month what we now make in a day. We owe it all to you for sharing your ideas," Mrs. Johnson said, her hands clasping Clara's warmly.

"Mrs. Johnson, you helped us so much when we were in need; I won’t forget that."

"Today, I wanted to talk to you about the cold pot skewers," Clara transitioned to the main topic.

"Cold pot skewers?"

"Yes, since it's hot now, you can prepare the hotpot base at home and take it to the market. Even cold, it should sell faster."

Mrs. Johnson nodded, understanding the concept and appreciating the idea.

"We'll split the profits from now on. I can't just take your idea and run with it."

"Mrs. Johnson, come on," Clara smiled playfully, "If you don’t start cooking soon, I’m going to starve!"

Mrs. Johnson laughed, jumping up. "Oh, I can't let that happen!"

After they shared a meal, Clara couldn't argue against Mrs. Johnson’s insistence, and the topic of splitting profits faded without resolution.

Clara then drove her truck to the house where she used to live. Although it had collapsed, memories of her mother—so timid yet strong—flooded her mind.

After reminiscing for a while, Clara parked her truck at the base of the hill and walked toward the Blossom Grove, carrying her things.

“Mom, Dad, I'm back!” Clara shouted as she entered the grove.

Unlike her composed demeanor outside, she was now carefree, full of innocence and joy.

"Clara! Why didn't your sister come with you?" Mrs. White exclaimed, her happiness evident.

"She's preparing for tomorrow’s journey south."

"You're heading south?" Mr. Green asked, curious.

"Yes, I'm going to negotiate a seafood business."

"You girls are so determined. Just make sure you take time to rest," Mrs. White said with concern.

"Mom, we’re fine! Doing what we love brings us joy. Once we're successful, we’ll come back and live with you all," Clara said, leaning against Mrs. White.

Mrs. White affectionately ruffled Clara's hair. 

"Be careful out there. Try to recruit talented people for your cause," Mr. Green advised. "If anyone comes after you, you need to be strong enough to defend yourself."

"Yes, I will," Clara promised, taking his words to heart.

After leaving Mr. Green, Clara headed over to Mr. Brown, the butcher she usually bought from.

"What can I get you today?" Mr. Brown beamed at Clara.

"You look younger every time I see you!" Clara teased.

"You and your sweet talk!" Mr. Brown laughed.

"Actually, I'm here to discuss a business opportunity."

"What kind of business?"

"Where do you get the pigs you sell every day?"

"All the pigs come from my family’s farm. Sometimes we buy from local farmers if we need more."

Clara nodded, understanding. "I want your family to expand the operation—raise as many pigs as possible, and I'll buy them from you."

"You're planning to sell pork?"

"I'm opening a supermarket. I'd like your family to sell there, just pay me rent each month. The extra pigs will supply the food court."

"Are you serious? What if business doesn’t go well?"

"It will thrive. If you're worried, I can give you an advance payment. You can decide after seeing the supermarket."

"That sounds fair, but my family needs reassurance with that advance."

Clara understood. After further discussions, they went to Mr. Brown's house to gather his family and confirm the initial number of pigs to raise.

In the end, both sides agreed, and Clara paid a deposit of $3,000.
