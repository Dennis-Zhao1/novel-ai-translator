Chapter 1: A Welcome Surprise

Clara Joy had finally settled into her new place and wasted no time stocking up on household essentials. As she unpacked, she couldn't help but think of her friend, Emily Quinn, who was still staying with Mrs. Smith. Clara made a mental note to pick her up the next day.

"Where have you two been all this time?" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, pulling Clara and her companion, Ethan Taylor, in for a warm hug.

"We just found a place to live in town. What about Emily?" Clara replied, her voice laced with concern.

"Her mother took her away a couple of days ago. They said you weren't around anymore, so the previous arrangements fell through. Her brothers came to pick her up, and Mr. Brown and I couldn't do much to stop them," Mrs. Smith explained, her brow furrowed in frustration.

Clara frowned slightly. It seemed like Emily's family was trying to take advantage of the situation.

Determined to help her friend, Clara made her way to Emily's former home. She found Emily sitting on the porch, looking despondent. Clara felt a pang of regret for not handing over Emily's contract earlier.

"Mrs. Johnson! Can we talk?" Clara called out from the doorway, her voice firm yet friendly.

Seeing Clara, Emily's eyes filled with a glimmer of hope.

Mrs. Johnson, Emily's mother, appeared at the door, gaining confidence when she saw Clara standing alone. "What's all this fuss about?"

"Why did you bring my contracted helper to your house? What's going on here?" Clara asked, trying to keep her tone light but firm.

"Who’s your helper? She's my daughter!" Mrs. Johnson replied defiantly.

Clara sighed, her voice tinged with sarcasm. "Mrs. Johnson, you seem to have forgotten. I still have the contract. Maybe a little chat with some officials might jog your memory."

Mrs. Johnson, not one to take risks, hesitated at the mention of officials. Attempting to save face, she blustered, "Go ahead, call them! She’s still my daughter. But fine, I'll let her go."

Clara chuckled softly at the absurdity. "Oh, and by the way, Mrs. Johnson, Emily has been working for you these past two days. Shouldn't she be compensated?"

Grumbling under her breath, Mrs. Johnson relented when she saw Clara heading toward a neighbor. "Fine, I'll pay. No need to make a fuss among neighbors."

"Twenty dollars a day," Clara stated firmly, collecting the payment before taking Emily back to Mrs. Smith's house.

There, Clara handed Emily the money and they discussed plans for the future. They decided to set up a small business selling goods, with Mr. Brown handling logistics and deliveries. It was a chance to earn a decent living and gain some independence.

Once everything was settled, Clara and Emily returned to the county. Emily had imagined Clara’s new house to be modest, but when she saw the spacious, welcoming structure, she was taken aback.

The house featured a large living room, several bedrooms, a well-equipped kitchen, and, thankfully, a proper bathroom—something many houses in the area lacked.

When Clara officially set up her stall, her friend Jack started helping out. At times, when finding a good spot seemed impossible, Jack appeared more anxious than Clara. But Clara’s calm reassurance that "good things come to those who wait" soon proved true, and their customer flow steadily increased.

With their move to the county, Clara decided to keep things simple and not involve others just yet. Instead, her friend Lily started crafting perfumes and soaps, while Hannah experimented with pastries. Meanwhile, Emily followed Clara’s designs to create unique embroidered pouches.

As a result, Clara’s stall grew larger and more popular by the day.

"Hey, you're still here selling!" exclaimed Lucy, her face lighting up as she spotted Clara.

"Lucy!" Clara greeted her with a smile.

"I can't thank you enough for what you did for us last time. I've been meaning to thank you, but my grandma fell ill, and I had to visit her. Just got back yesterday and came out to find you," Lucy explained.

"Lucy, it was nothing," Clara replied, waving off the gratitude.

Lucy shook her head. "This is a thank-you gift from me. And my dad wanted me to give you this, too. Those crooks are in big trouble now, thanks to you. My dad even got a commendation!" she added, leaning in conspiratorially.

Her assistant opened a small pouch, revealing several crisp bills.

"I really can't accept this. It was just a small favor," Clara insisted, realizing the potential benefits of having the magistrate's family as allies.

"You have to take it! Otherwise, my dad and I will feel guilty. Besides, I really like your spirit and would love to be friends," Lucy insisted, leaving Clara with no choice but to accept.

"Jack?" Lucy suddenly exclaimed, spotting him nearby.

"See you tomorrow, Clara!" Jack called, visibly startled by Lucy's presence and quickly making his exit.

"Did he just call you boss?" Lucy asked, eyes wide with surprise.

Clara nodded, unsure how to explain.

Lucy’s demeanor shifted instantly as she turned to Clara with a mischievous grin. "So, he really listens to you, huh?"

"Well, I guess you could say that," Clara responded, noticing the playful tone in Lucy's voice.

"How about you take me on as your apprentice? I promise I'll bring a gift for my apprenticeship tomorrow!" Lucy declared with a twinkle in her eye.

"Um, well..." Clara was taken aback, unsure how to respond to Lucy’s sudden request.

"Don't worry about it. I'll just follow you around like Jack does," Lucy said with a laugh, her enthusiasm contagious.

Clara was speechless but couldn't help but feel a growing fondness for the straightforward girl.

Before Clara could fully process the situation, Lucy asked for her address.

Clara, seeing the potential for a valuable friendship, shared her location, knowing that Lucy, with her connections, could easily find out on her own.
