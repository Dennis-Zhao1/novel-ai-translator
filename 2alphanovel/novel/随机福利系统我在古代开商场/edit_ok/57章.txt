**The Smith Family Invitation**

After all that had unfolded, Clara Joy and her friends were on high alert, carefully planning their journey. Five days passed without any major incidents, but a lingering sense of unease accompanied them as they reached their destination.

Clara Joy couldn't shake off her doubts: how had someone from the city known to pursue them after assuming they'd been victims of the hallucinogenic mishap? How did anyone know they were still alive, let alone track their movements? Had they been under surveillance since leaving the county?

Their recent escape was thanks to a stranger's help, but what about next time? With the enemy lurking in the shadows, how could they defend themselves?

"Finally made it to Harbor Town! I can already smell the salty air," said Sue, eagerly leaning out of the car window.

Harbor Town was bustling; seafood vendors lined the streets, calling out to passersby.

"Little sis, stop overthinking it! You're just gonna spoil your mood, and there's nothing we can do about it right now anyway," Sue remarked, noticing Clara Joy's serious expression.

Clara Joy shook her head in response. It was best to be ready for anything. She leaned out of the side window too, her gaze fixed toward the city. Just wait; we'll come for you, and when we do, revenge will be ours.

As their group entered the town in their two cars, they caught the attention of some keen eyes nearby. Soon, they found an inn to settle down.

"Innkeeper, could you prepare a couple of tables of your best seafood dishes for us?" Sue requested before heading upstairs, her mouth watering at the thought of the flavors.

"Would you prefer to dine in the hall or have it sent to your rooms?" the innkeeper asked.

Sue turned to Clara Joy for her input. "The hall sounds good; we’ll head down shortly."

"Alright then," the innkeeper replied with a broad smile.

"How are we going to find a reliable seafood vendor?" Sue wondered.

"Let's ask the innkeeper for some tips first," Clara Joy suggested. Unbeknownst to them, a group at a nearby table exchanged glances, nodded in agreement, and quietly settled their bill before leaving the inn.

That afternoon, Clara Joy and her friends explored Harbor Town. After talking with the innkeeper, Clara Joy learned about the two largest trading companies in town: the Smith Family Trading Company and the Johnson Family Trading Company. However, the innkeeper didn't specify which one was more reliable.

Clara Joy decided to take her time gathering more information before making any decisions. Sue chatted excitedly with Hannah, pointing out various seafood delights as they passed, her enthusiasm infectious. "These lobsters are perfect for a classic seafood boil!"

"What's a seafood boil?" Hannah asked, tilting her head in confusion.

"I... I'm not sure how to explain it. Just trust me on this one," Sue replied, a bit flustered.

Hannah pouted, feeling left out. "Fine, I’ll take your word for it."

Watching their lively interaction brought a smile to Clara Joy’s face, easing her worries a little. She decided to let go of her burdens and enjoy the moment.

"Big sister, let's buy some seafood to prepare for dinner! I really want to try a seafood boil," Clara Joy said, linking her arm with Sue's.

"Alright, I'll make it for you when we get back to the inn," Sue agreed.

"I can't wait to taste it!" Clara Joy exclaimed, her mouth watering in anticipation.

With her spirits lifted, she looked at the array of seafood, her appetite naturally increasing. "Let’s buy some now and cook it later. I want it tonight!" she insisted, standing at the entrance of a lobster vendor, refusing to budge.

With a sigh of resignation, Sue eventually relented. They bought some crabs, shrimp, and shellfish, then searched for seasonings before heading back to the inn.

Back at the inn, Clara Joy rented a small room in the backyard. She watched as Sue prepared the seafood, while Hannah, more focused than ever, didn’t blink as she observed Sue’s every move, eager to learn so she wouldn't have to rely on Clara Joy for everything.

"All done! Just let it marinate for a while," Sue announced after finishing.

With the enticing aroma wafting through the air, Clara Joy found it hard to resist diving in immediately. But Sue firmly held her back, insisting they let it soak for more flavor.

Seeing that this wasn’t a matter concerning him or Caleb, Sean decided to inform Clara Joy he would go out to gather some news, and Sarah insisted on joining him.

By evening, Clara Joy had the innkeeper bring their meals to their room. They finally got to enjoy the long-awaited seafood boil.

"Oh wow, this is delicious!" Hannah exclaimed from another table.

At that moment, Clara Joy couldn't even respond; she was too busy savoring her food, while Sarah was equally enamored, leaving little room for conversation.

Autumn and Yvonne watched Hannah devour her food with relish but hesitated to try any themselves. Was it really okay to eat it?

"Come on, you two, dig in! Sis, Yvonne!" Hannah urged.

"Is it really safe?" Autumn asked uncertainly.

Hearing this, Clara Joy turned to Autumn and Yvonne. "Just give it a try; everyone has different tastes. Some like it, and some don’t. There’s no pressure."

Upon hearing this, Autumn and Yvonne each took a small piece. As soon as Autumn chewed, she found it strange and could barely swallow it down. After a moment of disappointment, she decided to grab something else to eat.

Seeing that most of the group seemed to enjoy the dish, Clara Joy decided to introduce it to the marketplace.

Just as they finished their meal, a knock suddenly came at the door.

Yvonne opened it to find the innkeeper standing outside, looking hesitant.

"Is there something you need?" she asked, noticing the innkeeper’s discomfort.

"Well, there are some folks outside looking for you ladies," the innkeeper replied.

At this, Clara Joy stepped forward, noticing the troubled expression on the innkeeper’s face. "Do you know who they are?"

"They’re from the Smith Family Trading Company."

"We don’t know them. Please let them know we’re not interested," Clara Joy replied.

"They’ve blocked the inn and insist I tell you to come meet them for a small gathering," the innkeeper pressed.

"Why would they know us and come here looking for us?" Clara Joy’s face hardened.

"It’s possible they’ve been watching you since you entered the town. Today, they might have overheard you talking about buying seafood in the hall," the innkeeper explained, lowering his head.

"They want to meet you, probably to discuss business. I assure you, it’s nothing sinister. Please consider going."

"And what if we don’t want to go?" Clara Joy asked, her voice icy.

"Miss, they’re blocking my inn, and we can’t operate normally. I ask for your understanding," the innkeeper pleaded.

With a sigh, Clara Joy didn’t want to make things harder for the innkeeper. "Alright then. Let’s go see what the Smith Family wants."
