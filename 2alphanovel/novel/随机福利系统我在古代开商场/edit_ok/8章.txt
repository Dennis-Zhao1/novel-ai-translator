### Healing

Ethan Jade exchanged a doubtful glance with Clara Joy, still trying to figure out if she was genuinely offering help or merely looking for an excuse to get close to him. Had he known what he was getting into by involving himself in her affairs, he might have thought twice before agreeing to her request.

Clara noticed his skepticism and responded with even more earnestness. She knew it was difficult for people to take her seriously, especially given her age and lack of a formal medical background.

“Mr. Jade, I promise you, I’m sincere,” Clara insisted, her voice steady and unwavering.

Ethan frowned slightly, still unsure whether to trust her. Yet her determination and clear resolve were difficult to dismiss.

“You do realize that if anything happens to my grandfather, there won’t be forgiveness. You’d best be absolutely certain of your capabilities,” Ethan warned, his tone protective and firm.

Clara didn’t flinch. “I understand. But his condition won’t improve without immediate action.”

“I’m willing to take that risk,” chimed in Sarah Quinn, Clara’s closest friend.

“So am I,” echoed Emily Quinn, Sarah’s younger sister, her voice brimming with quiet confidence.

“If your grandfather’s condition worsens, it will only get harder to treat. If you’re worried, perhaps a trusted doctor can oversee the process,” Clara suggested calmly. “If you’re still uncomfortable, we’ll find another way to repay your kindness. But this is a chance we shouldn’t waste.”

Clara stepped aside, letting Ethan consider her words. She felt she’d said enough and that it was now his decision to make. Ethan furrowed his brow, torn between mistrust and desperation. His grandfather’s health had been steadily declining, and they were running out of options.

Finally, after a long silence, Ethan sighed. “I’ll trust you this once,” he conceded. He didn’t like taking risks, but something in Clara’s tone and composure convinced him to take the chance.

When they arrived at the Jade residence, Ethan didn’t immediately rush Clara to treat his grandfather. Instead, he suggested they all rest for the evening and wait until morning.

The next day, Clara and her friends awoke in the guest room prepared for them. Stepping outside, they were greeted by a cheerful housekeeper.

“Good morning! Can I get you some coffee or breakfast?” the housekeeper asked warmly.

“Yes, please. Thank you,” Clara replied politely, grateful for the hospitality.

After breakfast, a servant arrived to escort them. “Miss Joy, the young master requests your presence.”

Clara nodded, motioning for Sarah and Emily to follow. They were led to the courtyard, where Ethan and his grandfather, Mr. Jade, were seated along with two middle-aged men who appeared to be physicians. Clara guessed they were there to supervise her treatment.

“Keep a close eye on her,” Ethan instructed the two doctors. “If anything seems off, stop her immediately.”

Mr. Jade, frail but sharp-eyed, patted Ethan’s hand reassuringly. His illness had dragged on for months, and he was willing to try anything that might offer relief. Hearing Ethan mention a girl who claimed she could help intrigued him, though he remained skeptical.

“Good morning, Mr. Jade,” Clara and her friends greeted him respectfully.

“T-thank you for coming,” Mr. Jade said with effort, his voice weak but kind.

Clara stepped forward and took his pulse, her expression calm and focused. Ethan watched her closely, trying to gauge her competence.

After a moment, Clara asked Mr. Jade to open his mouth. She observed his pale tongue with a thick white coating, her brow furrowing slightly in thought.

The two observing doctors exchanged glances, impressed by her thoroughness. They nodded, recognizing her approach as legitimate.

“What’s wrong with my grandfather?” Ethan asked as Clara finished her examination.

“Facial paralysis,” Clara diagnosed succinctly.

“Facial paralysis?” One of the doctors tilted his head, unfamiliar with the term.

“It’s a condition often caused by aging and a weakened immune system, leading to insufficient defenses,” Clara explained. “If left untreated, it can worsen, affecting both health and quality of life.”

The doctors nodded, impressed by her detailed explanation, which matched their own findings. Ethan glanced at them, noting their approval.

“Why do we need to move inside? Can’t the treatment be done here?” Ethan asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

“After acupuncture, it’s important to avoid drafts or sudden temperature changes,” Clara replied. “It helps ensure the treatment is effective.”

Inside, the room was quiet as Clara prepared her tools. The two doctors leaned in to observe, their curiosity piqued by her calm precision. Clara’s confidence was evident in her steady hands as she placed each needle with practiced skill.

The room held its breath, not wanting to disturb her focus. Ethan, who had been standing nearby, found himself oddly mesmerized by her determination.

Once she finished, Clara sat back and accepted a glass of water from Emily. She wiped her brow, the strain of the procedure catching up to her.

The two doctors hesitated but couldn’t contain their curiosity any longer. “Miss Joy, may we ask about the technique you used?” one of them ventured.

Clara smiled, appreciating their interest. “Of course. I’d be happy to explain.”

She outlined the principles behind her method, her tone warm and instructive. The doctors listened attentively, their respect for her growing with every word. By the time she finished, they were nodding enthusiastically.

Ethan observed the exchange in silence, his perception of Clara slowly shifting. She wasn’t just some impulsive girl. Catching her eye, he found himself momentarily flustered when she flashed him a knowing smile.

“Ahem,” Ethan cleared his throat, rubbing the back of his neck. “Miss Joy, isn’t it about time to remove the needles for my grandfather?”

Clara nodded, returning her attention to Mr. Jade. Carefully, she removed each needle, monitoring his reaction closely. When the last needle was out, Mr. Jade’s face showed a marked improvement.

“Thank you, Miss Clara,” Mr. Jade said, his voice clearer than before. “I feel... better.”

Clara smiled, pleased with the outcome. “I’ll return for a follow-up in five days,” she promised.

Ethan motioned for a servant to step forward with a small pouch. “This is for your efforts, Miss Joy,” he said.

Clara held up her hands, declining the offer with a grin. “Consider this a repayment for your kindness. No payment is needed this time. But next time, I’ll charge a fee. My consultation is one silver dollar, so be prepared, Mr. Jade.”

Ethan chuckled, a rare smile lighting up his face. “I’ll make sure to have it ready.” 

As Clara and her friends gathered their things, Ethan couldn’t help but watch her go, his thoughts lingering on her words and actions. She was full of surprises, and he had a feeling this wouldn’t be the last time their paths crossed.
