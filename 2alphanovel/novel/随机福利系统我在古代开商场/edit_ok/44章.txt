**Perseverance is Victory**

After walking for about half an hour, Ethan Jade and Clara Joy finally spotted a quaint stone-built house nestled among the trees.

Ethan quickly pulled Clara to the side, uncorking a bottle of wine. As the gentle breeze rustled through the forest, the rich aroma of the wine began to weave through the air.

“What are you two doing here?” 

A deep voice echoed from behind them not long after. 

“Hey there, sir. Did you buy this place? If not, why would you care what we do here?” Ethan countered casually.

“Hmph, you young folks really don’t understand manners.” 

“I don’t know you, so why should I bother?” Clara chimed in, her tone light.

“Buddy, this wine is special. You have to try it!” Ethan urged, pouring some wine into a cup.

The aroma intensified, filling the air with an enticing scent. However, before Clara could take a sip, the old man snatched it away.

“Such fine wine shouldn’t be wasted like this.” 

Ethan frowned slightly. “What’s your deal? It’s our wine, and we can drink it however we like.”

“How much is this wine? I’ll buy it,” the old man insisted, a glimmer of interest in his eyes.

“I told you, it’s not for sale.” 

The old man took a deep whiff of the wine, and it stirred something deep within him, igniting his craving. 

“I’ll give you a thousand dollars.”

“As I said, it’s not for sale. But if you agree to one request, I can let you drink this wine for free, and there will be more where that came from.” 

The old man raised an eyebrow, curiosity piqued. “What’s the request?”

“I need your help to build a house.” 

The old man scrutinized Ethan closely. “You’ve come looking for me specifically, haven’t you?”

“Yes.” Ethan stood up straight, determination in his eyes. “I want you to help me construct a large pavilion.” 

The old man’s expression darkened slightly. “There are plenty of builders; why seek me out?”

“If you look at my blueprints, you’ll see that only you can build it solidly and safely.” 

“I haven’t built anything in a long time. You should just leave.” 

With that, the old man handed the cup of wine back to Ethan. 

Disappointment washed over him, but he refused to give up. “I won’t back down.” 

The old man paused, considering his words, before turning to leave. 

After that, Ethan set up two simple shelters in the woods next to the old man’s house, making it their temporary home. 

At first, he and Clara went hiking in the mountains, and when they returned to the shelters, Ethan would sprinkle barbecue spices made by Clara over their catches and enjoy a feast. They even occasionally shared a cup of wine together.

“Delicious! Barbecue paired with fine wine is truly a rare delight,” Clara said, savoring the moment. 

Every day, the old man was tormented by the tantalizing smells of wine and meat, and Ethan’s teasing words only made him want to explode with frustration. But every time he tried to confront him, Ethan would simply remind him that the forest wasn’t his.

As the bottles of wine dwindled, Ethan noticed that the old man still managed to keep his cool. So, he decided to venture down the mountain to buy several large jars of wine, bringing his distillation equipment back with him. 

Each day, he set up his distilling apparatus nearby, creating an even richer aroma than before. 

“Kid, your intentions are quite wicked,” the old man remarked, shaking his head.

“Just a little gesture. If you agree to help me build, I’ll give you all the pure wine I produce, and I’ll even teach you how to make the distillation device. You’ll be able to enjoy excellent wine anytime you want.” 

The old man found himself tempted. Such pure wine was hard to come by, and he had developed quite the taste for it. It was the first time he regretted his former addiction to alcohol.

“You think merely this will persuade me to come out of the mountains?”

“Tell me what you want, and I’ll do it.” 

Ethan displayed a willingness to adapt, which intrigued the old man. 

“Serve as my assistant for a few days. If I’m pleased, I’ll build for you, and I won’t charge for labor. Just buy the materials yourself.”

Ethan felt a wave of excitement at this opportunity. “Alright, sir! What do you need me to do?”

The shift in his attitude shocked the old man. He couldn’t believe someone could have such thick skin. 

From then on, Ethan felt like the old man was deliberately trying to make his life difficult, giving him tasks like organizing tools and cleaning while denying him any food, forcing him to eat only wild vegetables. 

Meanwhile, Clara managed to enjoy a few sips of wine and bites of meat alongside the old man. Fortunately, Clara was still aware enough to hide some meat for Ethan to eat. 

“Kid, go clean up the yard.” 

“That’s just leaves; if I sweep them away, they’ll just come back.”

“Still, it needs to be done. Are you going or not?” 

With gritted teeth, Ethan replied, “Fine, I’ll go.” 

“Kid, come help me with the mud. I think it would look better if I added another layer of mud to the outside of my house.” 

So, Ethan took a metal board and began to smear mud on the walls of the house. 

By day’s end, his hands were sore, and his clothes were completely ruined. Thankfully, he had brought a change of clothes to wear in his shelter that night. 

But the old man wasn’t done yet; the next day, he complained that the mud layer was too thin and insisted he add another one. 

Fuming, Ethan threw down his trowel. “I’m done!” 

“Today’s the last day. Tomorrow, I’m heading down the mountain with you.” 

“Alright, sir! I’m thrilled to be helping with the walls!” 

Ethan’s mood brightened immediately, his smile radiant. 

“Come, knead my legs.” 

“Coming, sir!” Ethan said in a playful tone, despite his dirt-covered attire. 

“Forget it; you can go now. I don’t want you getting my clothes dirty,” the old man waved dismissively. 

Ethan, however, took the opportunity to dust off his clothes, sending a cloud of dust right into the old man’s face, causing him to sneeze repeatedly.

“Sir, I’ll take my leave now.” 

Just as he was about to step outside, the old man called out, “Get ready to head down tomorrow.” 

Ethan’s heart raced with excitement, almost causing him to trip. Who knew how messy he had been these past few days? 

“Okay!” 

The next day, Ethan finally succeeded in bringing the old man down the mountain. 

Since his family consisted solely of women, which made things a bit tricky, he decided to purchase the neighboring house for convenience. This way, other men could stay there in the future.

That day, Ethan spent a well-deserved day of rest, doing nothing but lying flat and enjoying his newfound freedom. 

On that same day, Yan Taylor finally met his master again, tears streaming down his face.

“Master, you wouldn’t believe how much my junior brother has tormented me during this time!” 

“Your master could have easily been driven to the brink as well.” 

“You brought the old man down?” Ethan nodded, looking utterly exhausted.

“What did Lan Lan do to you?” 

“I went out with some friends, and she insisted on tagging along. But they were all guys! She insisted you told her to take care of her, so she followed me, ruining my chances of having fun with my friends.” 

“Now how am I supposed to learn those fun things?” Yan Taylor complained, feeling utterly unjust.
