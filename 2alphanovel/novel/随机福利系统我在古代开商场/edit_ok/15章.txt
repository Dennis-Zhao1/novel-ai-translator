**Opening Up the Heart**

"Mom, I know things have been tough, but we're here to help you through it, okay?" Clara said, holding Mrs. Smith's hand with genuine warmth.

"Yes, Mom, you still have me and Clara. We'll make sure life gets better from now on," Ivy chimed in, snuggling up to Mrs. Smith with a reassuring smile.

Mrs. Smith gently ran her fingers through Ivy and Clara's hair, managing a faint smile. Then, she extended her hand towards the silent Emily, who had been quietly observing.

"Emily, I wish I had done more to protect you in the past. Please don't hold it against me."

"Let's work together to make things better," Emily replied, her face calm but lacking warmth.

Mrs. Smith sighed internally. She wished she could be more hopeful, but a lump in her throat made it hard to breathe easily. Her parents' attitudes still cut deep.

Watching her mother, Emily's expression shifted from concern to indifference.

"If you can't cheer up, we might as well pack up and move back tomorrow, and go back to working for someone else."

Mrs. Smith's heart raced at those words, panic taking hold.

"No, we won't! It's my fault, Emily. Please, don't be mad at me!"

"Expecting us to worry about your feelings after moving out just doesn't seem fair. Maybe it would've been better if you hadn't left at all," Emily snapped, frustration boiling over.

"And if she could sell us out, you think she wouldn't?"

Mrs. Smith fell silent, struck by the harsh truth in Emily's words.

In Emily's eyes, Mrs. Smith seemed to endure too much. Serving others, getting scolded, yet still willing to endure it.

"If you can handle it, fine. But if not, we're moving back tomorrow, and you'll go alone."

Mrs. Smith's unchanged demeanor only fueled Emily's anger further. Initially, she had mentioned moving back to provoke her mother, but now, suggesting she go alone was serious.

Deep down, Emily didn't have much affection for her. Perhaps, without their mother's burden, the three siblings could do better.

Watching Emily leave after her outburst, Mrs. Smith felt a wave of grievance wash over her. She turned to Clara and Ivy but found no comfort. Instead, they stood and walked away, saying, "Mom, think it over yourself."

"Hey, it's time for breakfast! I've made something tasty. I saw you brought back a bunch of chestnuts and apples yesterday—what are you planning to make?" Mrs. Smith called out early the next morning, entering the room where Clara and the others were still sleeping.

After much thought last night, she felt she had finally come to an understanding. Her parents' actions, with her father's silent approval, made it clear they didn't truly care about her.

It made sense; she was always considered an outsider. People often said that once a daughter marries, it's like pouring out a glass of water—hard to reclaim.

Thus, her priority now should be managing her own small family, and as a mother, she had an even greater responsibility.

As Clara and the others got up, they noticed the worry etched less deeply on Mrs. Smith's face, signaling she had finally come to terms with her situation.

"Emily, I've figured it out. You've had to worry about the house lately," Mrs. Smith said, picking up a comb and beginning to style Emily's hair.

"As long as you have, that's good," Emily replied curtly, though inside, she felt conflicted. It struck her how her mother had never once styled her hair before.

"Mom did my hair, so I want mine done too!" Ivy exclaimed, always seeking affection.

"Okay, okay, one at a time," Mrs. Smith laughed, trying to keep the mood light.

Seeing the moment right, Clara pulled out the pouch she had been holding.

"This is the money from selling the herbs yesterday. Please take it, Mom."

But Mrs. Smith pushed the money back. "You keep it. As long as you sisters know about it, that's enough. We need to be careful about it."

Upon hearing this, Clara understood her mother's concern, so she didn't insist.

"Come on, Mrs. Smith! Get out here!"

After breakfast, as Clara's family prepared to make caramel apples and roasted chestnuts, an angry voice called from outside.

"Oh, it's Mrs. Green! What's going on?" Clara said, curiosity piqued.

The family stepped outside, but Mrs. Smith was the first to greet the newcomer.

Seeing Mrs. Green's furious expression, along with a crowd of neighbors behind her, Clara quickly sensed trouble brewing.

"Did your family sell some herbs yesterday? I heard you made a good sum," Mrs. Green demanded.

Mrs. Smith nodded, understanding it was no secret; the neighborhood likely knew by now.

"Yes, we did sell some herbs."

"Someone saw your kids taking my daughter up to the mountain yesterday. Why didn't she get a share of that money?" Mrs. Green pressed, eyes blazing.

Standing beside her mother, Lily tugged at her sleeve. "Mom, I told you, the herbs were found by Ivy. I wasn't there; I went to pick apples instead."

Mrs. Green, furious at Lily's rebuttal, shoved her aside. "See? Others think you're soft, so they take advantage of you!" she scolded, pointing at Lily.

"I don't care; my Lily was on the mountain with you, so she deserves a share. Maybe she brought you good luck, allowing you to find the herbs!" Mrs. Green insisted, pushing Lily away again.

"Mrs. Green, that's not how it works. Ivy found the herbs, and besides, do you think it's fair for your family to share your husband's earnings with the neighborhood? Just because we live nearby doesn't mean we owe anyone anything," Mrs. Smith countered firmly.

This revelation opened Clara's eyes wide. She hadn't expected her mother to stand so strong.

Raising an eyebrow, Clara realized she wouldn't need to step in—Mrs. Smith was handling it well.

"Why should my husband share his earnings with the neighborhood?" Mrs. Green replied instinctively.

"Exactly! So there's no reason for us to share what Ivy found. If everyone thought like you, I'd have to follow them around, expecting a share of whatever they find!" Mrs. Smith continued, her voice unwavering.

With that, Mrs. Smith effectively silenced the neighborhood gossipers who thrived on drama.

"That's right; there's no logic in that!"

"Things found individually shouldn't be shared. It doesn't make sense."

Some neighbors, understanding the situation or fearing Mrs. Smith's assertive stance, readily agreed.

Mrs. Green, realizing she'd walked into a trap, found herself at a loss for words. As she glared at Lily, who stood beside Clara, it seemed her embarrassment was about to overflow.
