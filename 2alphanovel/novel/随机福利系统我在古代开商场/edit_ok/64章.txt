**Kuoping Island**

"What do you mean? Whose people are you talking about?"

"It means I've taken these two kids under my care."

"Are you serious?" Mrs. Smith's expression shifted immediately, disbelief etched across her face.

Clara Joy, standing beside her, wore a sweet, inviting smile.

"Seriously, how much?"

"Two hundred dollars."

"That's just ridiculous! You're jacking up the price—how can you ask for two hundred dollars for two little kids? Why don't you just go rob someone?" Clara's sister, Sarah, couldn't help but interject, her voice rising in indignation at the woman's audacity.

"Two hundred dollars is what I want."

"One hundred and twenty dollars—take it or leave it!"

"Please, just let us go with this lady. That way, my little brother can have money for school in the future."

"We're just kids and can do nothing. Even if you sell us to someone else, you wouldn't get such a high price. And today, we're willingly going with her, so the neighbors won't gossip about you later." The older brother chimed in to support Mrs. Smith, displaying unexpected cleverness. Clara Joy couldn't help but admire his savvy.

Mrs. Smith weighed her options for a moment before conceding.

"Fine, one hundred and twenty dollars it is. Hand over the money."

"Here's a deposit of twenty dollars. Tomorrow, once we draft the agreement at the county office, you'll get the rest."

Mrs. Smith eagerly accepted the money, tucking it into her handbag. Her demeanor shifted to one of flattery directed at Clara Joy.

"Alright, if you're buying, I'll comply."

Clara Joy beckoned the two small children to stand behind her.

"They'll come with me today."

"That won't do! What if you don't pay the rest tomorrow?"

"We're staying at the Green Valley Inn; otherwise, I'll walk away from this deal."

"Can you provide a bit more deposit? It would make me feel more secure."

Clara Joy shot Mrs. Smith a glance and withdrew another twenty dollars from her purse.

"Is this enough?"

"Yeah, yeah, it's fine." Mrs. Smith leaned in closer, looking at the two siblings.

"Don't blame me, kids; I'm just in a tough spot. You need to work hard and listen to your new lady. I'll be leaving now."

The siblings nodded, their expressions flat and devoid of emotion.

Seeing their lack of reaction, Mrs. Smith felt a surge of irritation but forced a smile for Clara Joy's sake.

"Well, I'm off now."

Clara Joy led the two siblings to a clothing store, where the owner helped them each pick out two outfits.

Afterward, she took them back to the inn, where she rented another room and had the innkeeper draw some hot water.

"Go wash up with your brother first."

"Yes, ma'am."

"Ma'am, you're back! How was the trip out to the beach?"

Half-Summer, having heard their voices, stepped out of the room and hurried over to Clara Joy.

"It was really fun!" Sarah pulled Half-Summer aside to chat.

Clara Joy felt a bit helpless, guessing that her sister had already filled Half-Summer in on their day's events.

Yet, she felt grateful that while she and Sarah were busy, Half-Summer could keep Sarah company.

Once the two kids emerged from their baths, Clara Joy had them introduce themselves.

"I heard that after this, we can't use our own names, so we'd like you to give us names, ma'am." The older brother requested.

Clara Joy pondered for a moment. These kids were young and wouldn't be able to help much at first, but if nurtured, they could grow to become valuable allies.

"Let's name one Sam and the other Max."

Unbeknownst to Clara Joy, the names she chose coincidentally mirrored those chosen by Sarah for her own companions.

"Thank you, ma'am!"

"Michael, you'll follow Sue from now on and teach Sam and Max some useful skills."

"Yes, ma'am."

A day or two later, Clara Joy received a message from Ethan.

Today, the locals from the small fishing village wouldn't be going out to sea and would have time to take her to Kuoping Island.

"Sarah, Sue, are you going?"

"No, no! You're going to work. Sue and I are just going to have fun!" Sarah waved her hand dismissively.

With that, Clara Joy set off with Yujin and Qiusa in tow.

Ethan had business to attend to, so he wouldn't accompany her this time.

Clara Joy boarded a small boat from the local trading business, arriving at the fishing village where someone was already waiting for her.

"Ma'am, why are you going to Kuoping Island? They're quite unfriendly towards outsiders."

"Do you know why?" Clara Joy inquired, curiosity piqued.

"I'm not sure about that."

Clara Joy mentally prepared herself for the worst.

However, she didn't expect the islanders to be so openly hostile towards outsiders.

As soon as they set foot on the island, they were stopped.

"You don't look like people from this dock town; where do you come from?"

"We're from Green Valley County."

"From such a far land? Sorry, we don't welcome you here. Please leave."

"Is there some misunderstanding?"

"There's no misunderstanding."

"I'm here to buy fruit from you."

"We don't sell any."

"Why not? I've seen your fields filled with fruit, yet your houses are just ordinary. If you sell your fruit to us, you could earn some money and improve your lives."

"We don't trust you." The person speaking turned away, leaving Clara Joy and her companions staring at each other in disbelief.

"No worries, let's go deeper into the island and see."

As they walked, they encountered many people, but no one acknowledged them.

Clara Joy didn't dwell on it; instead, she observed how much fruit the island had to offer.

"Michael, what should we do now? Who should we ask?"

"Hey, why haven't you three left? We've already said we don't welcome you here."

The girl who had initially spoken to Clara Joy confronted them again, clearly irritated to see them exploring.

"Ma'am, can you tell me why you dislike people from the mainland?"

"The island chief says that all mainlanders are bad people."

"Can you take me to meet your island chief?"

The girl considered it for a moment. Since they weren't leaving, she figured she'd have to bring the island chief in to send them off.

"Alright, follow me."

Clara Joy and her companions trailed behind the girl as she led them deeper into the island.

"This is the island chief's house. Are you sure you want to go in? He'll definitely be angrier if you do."

"Thank you for your trouble."

The girl didn't say more and directly walked inside.

Clara Joy surveyed the chief's residence, which was no better than the others on the island.

"Chief, these three are here to see you."

"Sophie, did you ask where they're from?"

The island chief, an elderly man with a head of white hair and a healthy, ruddy complexion, stood firmly.

"They're from deep inland."

"Didn't I say to keep those troublemakers out? Why aren't you sending them away?"
