Chapter 1: A Welcome Surprise

Having finally secured a place to stay, Clara Joy wasted no time in buying all sorts of household essentials. She was also reminded of her friend, Song Qingqing, who was still living with Chen Ping. Clara made a mental note to pick her up tomorrow.

“Where have you two been all this time?” Chen Ping asked as she pulled Clara and her companion, Ethan Jade, close for a thorough look.

“We just found a place to live in the county. What about Qingqing?” Clara replied.

“She was taken away by her mother a couple of days ago. They said you weren’t around anymore, so the previous arrangements were off. I couldn't even get my hands on her contract, and her brothers came to pick her up. Uncle Li and I couldn’t stop them,” Chen Ping explained.

Clara raised an eyebrow. It seemed like they were practically offering her money now.

Clara made her way to Song Qingqing's former home, where she found her friend sitting dejectedly. Clara felt a pang of regret for having forgotten to hand over Qingqing's contract earlier.

“Ning Aunty! Come out here!” Clara called loudly from the doorway.

Seeing Clara, Song Qingqing's eyes lit up with hope.

Ning, Qingqing's mother, emerged from the house. Noticing that Clara was alone, her courage grew. “What’s all this shouting about?”

“Why did you bring my contracted maid to your house to work? What does that mean?” Clara shot back.

“Who’s your maid? She’s my daughter!” Ning retorted defiantly.

Clara scoffed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Aunty, you really have a selective memory! The contract is still with me. You don’t recognize it now? I guess I’ll have to call the officials over.”

Ning was typically someone who bullied the weak and feared the strong. The mention of officials sent a jolt of fear through her, but she still tried to save face. “If you have the guts, go ahead and sue! I’m not scared of you. She’s still my daughter. Hmph, I’ll just make her leave right now!”

Clara couldn’t help but suppress a laugh at Ning’s absurdity. “Oh, wait a minute, Ning Aunty. This girl has worked for you for two days. Shouldn’t she be compensated?”

Ning began cursing under her breath at the thought of paying, but when she saw Clara walking toward a villager, she quickly relented. “Fine, I’ll give you some money. No need to be so picky among neighbors.”

“Twenty wen a day, not a single one less,” Clara stated firmly.

After collecting the payment, Clara Joy took Qingqing back to Chen Ping’s house, where she handed her the money. They then discussed how to set up a stall for selling goods, deciding that from now on, Li An and Chen Ping would handle the stringing of items, and Li An would deliver them to town every morning, earning them a hundred wen each day.

Once everything was agreed upon, Clara and Qingqing returned to the county. Qingqing had expected Clara’s new house to be ordinary, but when she stood before it and saw the spacious structure, she was completely astonished.

The courtyard was expansive and welcoming, with a central hall, and behind it was a room. On each side, there were two additional rooms. The leftmost was a kitchen, divided into two sections for firewood and storage. As for the latrine, it was located at the back right, a bit distant from the main rooms.

In fact, many houses in the county lacked latrines, often just using a chamber pot that was placed outside in the morning for collection. However, Clara and her friends found that inconvenient, so they specifically sought out a place with proper facilities.

When Clara officially set up her stall, Yan Xu began following her around every day. Sometimes, when they couldn’t find a good spot, Yan Xu was even more anxious than Clara, feeling that they wouldn’t sell anything. But after Clara explained that “good wine needs no bush,” and they began to see a steady flow of customers, Yan Xu learned something valuable from Clara for the first time.

Now that they had moved to the county and Yan Xu was by her side, Clara decided not to have Shu Qingyan and the others join them for the time being. Instead, Shu Qingyan utilized the spring flowers to create various scented perfumes and soaps, while Shu Yuqin experimented with delicious pastries. Meanwhile, Song Qingqing followed Clara’s designs to embroider small pouches.

As a result, Clara’s stall grew larger and more popular.

“Hey, you’re still here selling!” exclaimed Miss Zhang, her eyes sparkling with excitement upon seeing Clara.

“Miss Zhang!” Clara greeted her warmly.

“I can’t thank you enough for saving us a while back. I’ve been wanting to come and express my gratitude. But my grandma in the nearby county fell ill, and I had to go see her. I just got back yesterday and came out to find you today,” Zhang Lanlan explained.

“Miss Zhang, you’re too kind,” Clara replied, trying to downplay it.

Zhang waved her hand dismissively. “This is a thank-you gift from me, and my father asked me to bring you this as well. To be honest, those flower traffickers have harmed many girls and are on the court’s blacklist now. My father even received a reward for it!” Zhang whispered conspiratorially, leaning closer to Clara.

Her maid, holding a bundle, revealed a small corner to show Clara—inside were ten taels of silver.

“I really can’t accept this. It was just a little help,” Clara insisted, recognizing the potential benefits of fostering a good relationship with the county magistrate’s family for her future endeavors.

“You have to take it! Otherwise, my father and I will feel uneasy. Also, I really like your personality, and I’d like to be friends with you.” In the end, Clara found it hard to refuse and accepted two hundred taels of silver.

“Yan Xu?” Just as Clara tucked the silver away, she heard Zhang’s voice gasp in surprise.

“Master, I’m leaving now. See you tomorrow!” Yan Xu called out, visibly startled to see Zhang and running away.

“Did he just call you Master?” Zhang asked incredulously.

Clara nodded, unsure how to explain the situation.

But to her surprise, Zhang’s demeanor changed instantly, and she approached Clara with a flattering smile. “Does that mean he listens to you very well?”

“Um, I guess so,” Clara said hesitantly, sensing the underlying motives in Zhang's tone.

“How can you say ‘I guess so’? Respecting teachers is important; he should definitely listen to you!” 

Clara felt like she was being brainwashed but had no evidence to counter it.

“Master, what do you think of me?” Zhang asked, her tone casual as Clara sold her items.

“Pretty good, I guess,” Clara replied instinctively.

“Right? I think I’m pretty great too! How about you take me as your disciple? Don’t worry, I’ll definitely bring a gift for my apprenticeship tomorrow!” Zhang declared cheerfully.

“Um, huh?” Clara replied, her mind racing as she processed her words. 

“What’s wrong, Master?” Zhang asked, sounding completely at ease.

“I really don’t have anything to teach you,” Clara said, feeling helpless about this unexpected situation where everyone seemed eager to make her their mentor.

“Don’t worry about it; I’ll just follow you around like Yan Xu does,” Zhang said playfully, a hint of shyness in her voice.

Clara was speechless. If she couldn’t see the unfolding situation now, she really didn’t deserve to have crossed over from the twenty-first century.

Before Clara could voice her thoughts, Zhang asked where she lived.

Clara found herself liking this straightforward girl, despite their first meeting being a bit awkward because Zhang had seemed a bit haughty while shopping.

So Clara revealed her address.

Well, that was just a way to comfort herself, as Zhang was the daughter of the county magistrate—definitely someone she wanted to befriend. Even without her telling, Zhang could easily find out where she lived.
