**Chapter: White Cliff Temple**

Clara Joy led her younger brother, Ethan Jade, to the end of a narrow street in the southern part of the city. As they arrived, it was just as she had expected—desolate and overgrown.

“Mei... Mei!” Ethan suddenly called out, his voice breaking through the silence.

Clara turned around, her face lighting up with surprise. “Are you calling me? Who taught you to say that?”

But Ethan simply repeated, “Mei,妹妹 (sister).” Despite his limited understanding, Clara felt a warmth spreading through her heart. Even with the barren land stretching before them, the weight of their task seemed a little lighter.

“Come on, let’s go home,” she said, taking Ethan's hand.

Ethan sensed the happiness radiating from Clara and smiled back, feeling a sense of joy himself. 

“Master, we’ve arrived!” Clara announced brightly as they returned home. Not long after, Yan Xu came to visit.

Clara had assumed that he would be accompanied by Zhang Lanlan, but to her surprise, the elder Yan was with him.

“Grandpa Yan, you’re here! Please, take a seat,” Clara said warmly.

“No need for formalities. I just came to see you. It’s been a while since you visited the Yan family,” the old man replied with a kind smile.

Shu Yuqin, Clara’s caretaker, quickly brought over some tea. 

“I heard from Yan Xu that you’re planning to open a mall,” the elder continued.

“Yes, Grandpa Yan,” Clara said, her demeanor respectful and polite in front of the elder.

“You’re aiming for five floors. Have you considered that common craftsmen might not be able to accomplish that?” he asked, stroking his beard thoughtfully.

“I’m currently grappling with that issue. Since it’s meant to be a one-stop mall, I want it to be big enough for customers to find everything they need, along with some leisure spaces,” Clara sighed, her determination shining through.

“I know of someone who is arguably the best craftsman in the Southern Yan Kingdom, but he has since retired. If you could persuade him to help you, you wouldn’t have to worry about the construction quality at all,” the elder Yan said, a shrewd glimmer in his eyes.

“Please tell me where I can find him,” Clara urged eagerly.

“I’ve heard he’s living behind the White Cliff Temple, but he’s known to be quite eccentric. It won’t be easy to coax him out of retirement,” the elder warned.

“Do you know what he likes? It would help me approach him better,” Clara asked, her mind racing with possibilities.

“He has a fondness for fine wine, but only the best can catch his interest,” the elder Yan replied, a knowing smile on his face.

Clara nodded, grateful for the elder’s advice. “Thank you, Grandpa Yan, for thinking of me.”

“You’re too polite. In my heart, I consider you like my own granddaughter,” he chuckled.

“Grandpa Yan is indeed my grandfather,” Clara joked lightly.

“Now, wait a minute! Aren’t you mixing up the generations here?” Yan Xu interjected, raising an eyebrow in mock disapproval.

“Let me worry about my own lineage!” the elder Yan waved dismissively, his laughter echoing.

In the evening, Clara decided to keep the elder Yan and Yan Xu for dinner. They ventured out to buy fresh meat and vegetables, and Ethan eyed the fresh lamb Clara carried, swallowing hard in anticipation.

“You can’t eat it raw. We’ll cook it first, okay?” Clara said, trying to pacify him.

Ethan shook his head, his desire evident as he felt anxious not to upset her. 

“Roar!” he couldn’t help but let out a call, a sound that drew the attention of passersby.

Clara quickly reassured him, not feeling embarrassed by his outburst. “Let’s head home, shall we?”

Realizing his mistake, Ethan lowered his head, avoiding Clara’s gaze. Clara met the curious stares of the crowd with a smile, unfazed.

Back home, Clara made a hot pot using the base that Shu Yuqin had prepared. 

“It’s still so delicious! Master, we need to make sure Yuqin prepares more hot pot base in the future,” she exclaimed, savoring the flavors.

Hearing this, the elder Yan shot her a playful glare. Their titles were indeed a mix-up, but it was lighthearted.

“This feast could be described as exquisite,” the elder Yan remarked, clearly impressed.

After a joyful evening, Clara sent the elder Yan and Yan Xu off, leaving Ethan to enjoy his meal without interruption. 

Once the dishes were cleaned, Clara and Shu Yuqin continued teaching Ethan to speak.

The next day, Zhang Lanlan and Yan Xu arrived at Clara’s home in quick succession. Clara had grown accustomed to their presence and focused on her own tasks without concern.

She headed to the liquor store and purchased a large jar of fine wine. Returning home, she quickly set up a distillation apparatus to purify the wine.

She spent the entire day perfecting the process, and as the rich aroma filled the air, Clara knew she had succeeded. 

Using a beautiful ceramic jar she had bought, she sealed the wine inside, hoping to trade it with the retired craftsman for his help in building the mall.

Though she had considered seeking out other craftsmen, Clara knew that with so many people expected at the mall, safety was paramount. A collapse would be disastrous.

This time, she specifically told Yan Xu and Zhang Lanlan not to come by the next day. She planned to take Ethan up the mountain alone.

As they prepared to leave, Clara rented a carriage, realizing they would need it for the journey. 

Once they arrived at the foot of White Cliff Temple, Clara gazed up at the steep steps, her heart filled with doubt. How long would it take to climb to the top?

Watching those around her with determined expressions, Clara felt as though the stairs themselves were a test of one’s sincerity.

In that moment, she completely forgot about her own agility. But even if she remembered, she wouldn’t use it; after all, she wanted to pray for good fortune at the temple, and sincerity was key.

Even for someone trained in martial arts, the climb left Clara exhausted halfway up. 

“Ethan, wait for me! Hold on!” Clara called out, enviously watching her brother effortlessly ascend the stairs.

Ethan, oblivious to her struggle, paused and stepped back a few stairs to pull Clara up, encouraging her to keep moving.

Thus, Clara ended up dragging Ethan’s sleeve for the second half of the climb, climbing step by step until they finally reached the top.

Standing at the summit and looking down, Clara felt a wave of dizziness wash over her. 

Now she understood why others brought benches—to rest after climbing.

She found a secluded spot to hide the wine, then purchased some incense at the temple. 

With reverence, she prayed before every statue in the temple. 

She wasn’t sure if she should believe in these traditions, but she figured that a little sincerity wouldn’t hurt, especially since she had already experienced such an incredible journey across realms.

After completing her prayers, Clara intended to take the small path next to the temple to seek out the craftsman, but she was halted by a young monk.

“Please wait, Miss,” he said respectfully.

“There resides a rather eccentric master above. If you go up, you might disturb his peace, so I kindly ask you to reconsider,” the monk advised.

Clara nodded slightly. “To be honest, I came specifically to find him.”

“Then I shall not stop you,” the monk said, stepping aside to let her pass.
