**The Two Sisters**

Today marked the fifth day since Clara Joy had been preparing for her journey south. She and her sister, Julia, decided to take a stroll to see if there was anything else they needed to buy for the trip. Since this was their first time traveling far in this era, being well-prepared definitely put their minds at ease. Moreover, it had been a long time since the two of them had gone shopping together.

"Sis, look over there! They’re selling sugar-coated fruits! Let’s go buy some!" Clara exclaimed excitedly.

"Sure!" Julia replied with a bright smile, her affection for her sister evident.

However, standing nearby was their older brother, Ethan Jade, who was distracted by something else entirely.

"Ethan, what are you looking at?" Clara noticed his absent-mindedness.

"Over there!" Ethan pointed, and following his gaze, Clara found herself staring at a scene that was hard to forget—something she had only seen on television in her past life.

A group of people was being led by chains, shackled like dogs, as they were pulled toward them. Whenever one stumbled or dared to look up, the guards would whip them mercilessly.

"How pitiful," Ethan muttered, tugging at Clara's sleeve.

"This is the reality of our time. There's no changing it," Clara replied with a stoic expression, though her heart ached at the sight.

"Everyone, come see! New slaves just arrived, being sold at a low price!" a vendor shouted, bringing the group closer to where Clara and the others stood.

"There are both men and women—take home the pretty ones to warm your bed, and the ugly ones to clean the house."

The sugar-coated fruits were being freshly made, so Clara and her siblings lingered nearby, watching the scene unfold. As more people gathered around, Clara’s eyes fell upon two young girls in the group of shackled individuals. They wore scant clothing, barely covering their essential parts, which attracted the attention of many lecherous onlookers.

"Those two girls are truly unfortunate. It's like they’re flowers, on display for everyone to gawk at," Julia said with a heavy heart.

"I’ll take those two girls," a woman declared, strutting forward with an air of confidence.

"We won't be working in a brothel," one of the girls replied with a serious expression.

Clara raised an eyebrow, intrigued. They still maintained their dignity despite their dire situation.

"Hey, they’ve got some spirit! Just the type my Madam Liu loves to train," the woman laughed.

"Alright, I’ll have someone deliver them to your brothel," the guard replied, grinning widely.

In that moment, the girl who had spoken earlier kicked the man who had been holding her back and landed a punch on Madam Liu as well. The other guards quickly rushed in to subdue her, but the girl stopped, no longer resisting.

"We are slaves and can’t run away, but my sister and I refuse to go to a brothel. You can do whatever you want with the others," she stated resolutely, then tied herself back up.

"Hey, your sugar-coated fruits are ready!" called the shop owner, breaking the tension.

Clara, who didn’t care much for sweets, took the treats and divided them between Julia and Ethan. 

"Wait here for a moment," Clara said, her thoughts drifting back to the girl who had shown such strength. She headed to a fabric shop and purchased two rolls of cloth, then walked back toward the group of slaves.

Madam Liu was still shouting, but despite being chained, the girl jumped up nimbly, delivering a couple of kicks to the woman.

"I don't believe this! I will definitely tame you! You girls stay right here; I’m going to get help," Madam Liu said, storming off.

"Why waste your energy on those two? Bringing them home will only cause you trouble. Besides, there are other girls who are quite pretty," Clara said, stepping out from the crowd with a smile directed at Madam Liu.

Madam Liu's eyes sparkled at Clara's presence. Noting her attire, she assumed Clara came from a good family. As a shrewd businesswoman, she knew that it was wise not to offend someone who might be influential.

"Are you speaking up for them, young lady?"

"Not at all! I’m thinking of you, Madam. Those two look shifty; they might act obedient on the surface but could make trouble behind your back. Wouldn’t that be a loss for you?" Clara reasoned.

Madam Liu slapped her thigh, realizing Clara had a point. "You're right! The other girls are also decent."

"Hmph! I, Madam Liu, am magnanimous! I will let you two go this time," she announced, leaving to purchase other girls.

Once Madam Liu was out of sight, Clara stepped forward and quickly wrapped the two girls in the cloth she had bought.

"Will you come with me?" Clara asked, her voice soft yet firm.

"As long as it’s not to a brothel, we can go anywhere. You don’t think we have complete freedom of choice, do you?" the girl who had spoken earlier replied, her tone sharp.

"Why not? I see that you have some impressive skills," Clara countered.

"We are branded as slaves. Even if we leave, we can’t go anywhere. But since we know martial arts, we can avoid doing those filthy jobs," the girl said, raising her chin defiantly.

"Fine, I’ll buy both of you," Clara declared, just as a sleazy man appeared beside her.

"I'll take those two girls! I love a challenge," he grinned, eyeing the girls with a lecherous gaze.

"Sir, my sister spotted them first, so they can't go with you," Julia chimed in, suppressing her disgust for the man.

The man leered at Clara and Julia, stroking his clean-shaven chin. "Ladies, it’s not quite that simple. You haven’t even paid yet."

"How much for the two?" Clara asked the vendor.

"Thirty taels for both," the vendor replied.

Clara frowned; that price was clearly inflated, taking advantage of the competition.

As she hesitated, the sleazy man's lackey stepped in front of her. "My master has already bought them. You have nothing to do with this."

The lackey had assessed Clara's outer appearance and determined she was unlikely to be from a wealthy family.

"First come, first served," Clara insisted, unwilling to prolong the argument.

"Oh, today I’ll make sure I come last, and what are you going to do about it?" the lewd man stepped closer to Clara, invading her personal space.

Unable to suppress her irritation, Clara raised her hand and delivered a sharp slap across his face.
