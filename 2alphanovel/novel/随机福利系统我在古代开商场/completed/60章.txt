Ethan Jade suppressed his excitement and focused intently on Clara Joy and the others as they made their way through the small fishing village. Everywhere they went, familiar faces greeted him with warmth.

“Boss, you’re here!”

“The boss has arrived!”

Everyone wore genuine smiles, their faces illuminated with joy.

“How have you all been?” Ethan replied cheerfully to the village folks.

“Pretty good! With your help, our lives are getting better every day.”

A woman, her eyes sparkling with happiness, shared, “My daughter-in-law just gave birth to a big, healthy boy a couple of days ago!”

“Congratulations, Aunt Fu!” Ethan exclaimed, grinning.

“It’s all thanks to you, boss. Without your support, we wouldn’t have been able to afford another child. In the past, selling goods to the Xue family, we barely had enough to eat meat throughout the year,” Aunt Fu said gratefully, looking up at him.

“Auntie, that’s all in the past. Things will only get better from now on,” Ethan assured her.

As they walked, people from the village continued to greet him, and he responded to each one, showing no signs of impatience.

“Boss, you’re back!”

“Old Clan Leader!” Ethan said, spotting the arrival of the village’s elder and rushing forward to assist him.

“Why did you come out personally? Are you feeling better?” he asked with concern.

“Thanks to the herbs you sent last time, I’ve been drinking them for a few days, and I’m nearly back to normal,” the old man replied.

“That’s great! Please take care of yourself,” Ethan urged.

“Some villagers went out to sea yesterday and caught a lot of good stuff. Since you’re here, come to my house and taste some!” the clan leader invited with a smile.

“Sure!” Ethan agreed.

“These are your friends, right? Please come along,” the clan leader continued, gesturing for Clara Joy and the others to join.

“Clara, how about this? I’ll help the old clan leader back home, and you can wander around a bit. Just come over when you’re ready,” Ethan suggested.

“That sounds perfect,” Clara replied, her smile radiating warmth.

As Clara Joy and Shu Yuqin strolled through the village, they observed villagers sorting out their goods by the shore, while others came to pick them up.

“This Chen family seems really great. What do you think, Third Sister?” Clara asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

“The happiness on everyone’s faces doesn’t seem fake at all. It looks like Ethan Jade truly is a good person,” Shu Yuqin replied thoughtfully.

Just then, Clara spotted a group of children nearby. Curious, she approached them and asked Shu Yuqin for some snacks to share.

“Who are you looking for, Miss?” one of the children asked, tilting his head curiously.

“I just have a few questions for you,” Clara replied with a gentle smile.

“Sure, go ahead and ask!” the older child piped up eagerly.

“Do you know about the Chen family?” Clara inquired.

“Of course! My mom says the Chen family is our savior!” the child responded animatedly.

“We can eat meat regularly now, all thanks to them. They even bring us clothes and candies sometimes,” another child chimed in.

“Wait, you’re not from the Xue family, are you?” the older boy suddenly asked, looking at them suspiciously.

“No, we’re friends of the Chen family, just taking a look around the village,” Clara reassured them.

“Oh, so you’re friends of the Chen family! Then you must be good people too,” the boy said after a moment’s thought.

“Is there anything else you’d like to ask?” Clara continued.

“I heard that the Xue family used to come here to collect goods?” she pressed further.

“Yeah! The Xue family used their power to bully us, always offering us low prices. My parents risked their lives to go out to sea, and they barely made any money. The Xue family’s offers were pitiful, and they took ages to pay us. By the time they did, it was always much less than promised!” the older boy exclaimed, his frustration evident.

“At that time, we could barely survive. We wanted to sell our goods ourselves, but the Xue family wouldn’t let anyone buy from us. In the end, it was the Chen family who bought everything from us. Now we provide our goods directly to them,” he explained.

“Did the Xue family ever cause trouble afterward?” Shu Yuqin asked, intrigued.

“They did come around, but the Chen family helped us deal with them,” the boy responded confidently.

“The Chen family is great! They never lower their prices, and they always pay us right after taking the goods,” another child added.

After chatting with the kids, Clara felt she had gained a deeper understanding of the Chen family's ways. They continued to stroll around the village and eventually asked a villager for directions to the clan leader's house.

“You’re back! Please, have a seat!” the old clan leader welcomed them warmly, calling for his daughter-in-law to bring over some stools.

“Make yourselves at home; don’t be shy,” he said, noticing that Clara and the others might feel out of place.

“Thank you, Clan Leader,” Clara replied graciously.

“No need to thank us! You’re friends of the boss, which means you’re just as good as he is,” the clan leader insisted, his eyes twinkling with sincerity.

“Old Clan Leader, you flatter me,” Ethan said, chuckling lightly.

“The boss is always so humble. You’re our savior!” the clan leader remarked, a hint of nostalgia in his voice.

“Ethan, you’re here!” a cheerful voice called out.

“Xiaoman, you’re back! Did school let out early today?” Ethan asked, his expression brightening.

“Yeah, we have a day off today,” Xiaoman replied with a smile.

“How's school going?” Ethan asked, genuinely curious.

“My teacher praised me today, saying I’m making great progress!” she beamed with pride.

“Boss, I can’t thank you enough for helping Xiaoman go to the academy in town,” the clan leader’s daughter-in-law stated, stepping forward to affectionately pat Xiaoman’s head.

“Aunt, you don’t need to say that again,” Xiaoman said, slightly embarrassed.

“I’ll always be grateful. You built the village school, and now Xiaoman is going to the town academy. I’ll remember your kindness forever,” she added, stealing a glance at Clara and the others.

Clara’s thoughts raced. This aunt must have realized they were planning to discuss cooperation with the Chen family. She intentionally highlighted all the good things the Chen family had done for the village.

But Clara also felt a deeper appreciation for Ethan Jade’s kindness and integrity. How could she not trust someone like him to collaborate with?

At noon, Clara and her friends enjoyed a light seafood feast at the clan leader's home. The dishes were primarily steamed, showcasing the fresh flavors of the ocean.

After their meal, Ethan prepared to leave with Clara Joy. The old clan leader, ignoring Ethan's protests, insisted on accompanying them to the boat.

“Wahhhh—Mom!” a voice cried out from a nearby house.

“Don’t cry, my dear daughter. It breaks my heart to see you like this,” a woman’s voice trembled with emotion.

“I don’t want to marry; I don’t want to be a concubine! I just want to stay home and help you, please!” the girl pleaded desperately.

“Child, I have no choice! That despicable man has set his sights on you!” the mother lamented.

“Why must my fate be so cruel!” the girl cried, her voice filled with despair.

As they passed a home, Clara and the clan leader paused, drawn to the sounds of distress. Today had been filled with joy and optimism, but now, hearing the cries from this household piqued their curiosity.

“Ah, daughter, please don’t do anything rash!” the mother sobbed.

Hearing the commotion, Ethan immediately rushed inside, followed closely by his attendants.

“B-boss!” a voice stuttered.

“Haitang, what’s going on here?” Ethan demanded, his expression shifting to concern.

The clan leader led Clara and the others inside, where they saw Ethan's attendant holding a girl tightly.

“Clan Leader, you’re here too,” the older woman said, her face streaked with tears.

“What happened? What’s going on in this house?” the clan leader asked, looking around in alarm.
