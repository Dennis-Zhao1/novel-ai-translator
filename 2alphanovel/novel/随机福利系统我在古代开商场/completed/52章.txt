Preparations Before Departure

The day before heading south, Clara Joy returned to her village.

“Boss is here!” When Wang Fugui saw Clara approaching, he didn’t think twice about calling her “Boss.”

“Uncle Fugui, just call me San Ni, that’s fine.”

“That won't do. You are the Boss.”

Clara sighed, realizing further discussion about titles would be pointless. 

“I see that half of the land is already set up with greenhouses. Now Uncle Fugui can go buy seeds and get the women to start working. This way, we won't waste the land that's already prepared.”

“Sure, that’s exactly what I was thinking. Even if you didn’t come today, I was planning to come find you tomorrow,” Wang Fugui replied.

“What kind of seeds do you plan to buy?”

“Different vegetable seeds, everything we can get, plus some watermelon and cantaloupe.”

“Sounds good. I’ll take care of it tomorrow,” Wang Fugui nodded in agreement.

“By the way, Boss, I handed out the first batch of wages to the workers yesterday. I’ll go fetch the ledger for you to take a look.”

Clara didn’t refuse; trusting was one thing, but she needed to see the ledger to prevent future disagreements. 

As she carefully flipped through the pages, she found that Wang Fugui had recorded everything clearly, with notes on the purpose of each expense.

“Didn’t Uncle Fugui take any wages for himself?”

Wang Fugui’s face turned slightly red at her question. “Well, you didn’t mention how much I should take each month, so I…”

“That’s my oversight. Uncle Fugui mainly oversees the work, buys supplies, and pays the workers. How about five taels of silver a month?”

Wang Fugui looked at Clara in disbelief before quickly coming to terms with it.

“Of course, that's fine! I actually think that’s too much,” he said, scratching his head in a humble manner.

Noticing it was almost noon, Clara figured Chen Ping and her husband should be back from the market by now.

She bade farewell to Wang Fugui and headed over to Chen Ping's house, arriving just as Chen Ping and Li An returned.

“San Ni, you’re back?”

“Aunt Ping, how's business been lately?”

While lifting a stool outside, Chen Ping replied, “It’s okay, but it doesn’t sell as fast now that it’s warmer. We make about five to six hundred wen a day.”

“But you know, Uncle Li and I are quite satisfied. We used to earn in a month what we now make in a day. We owe it all to you and your sister for sharing your money-making methods,” Chen Ping said, grasping Clara’s hands warmly.

“Aunt Ping, what are you saying? You helped us so much when we were in need; I remember that in my heart.”

“Today, I came to talk to you about the cold pot skewers,” Clara transitioned into the main point after some pleasantries.

“Cold pot skewers?”

“Yes, since it’s hot now, Aunt Ping can prepare the hotpot base with clear oil at home and then take it to the market. Even if it’s cold, it should sell faster.”

Chen Ping nodded repeatedly, understanding Clara's idea and finding it excellent.

“We’ll split the profits from now on. How can you come up with an idea and we only earn from it?”

“Aunt Ping, don’t be so formal,” Clara pouted, “If you don’t start cooking soon, I’ll starve!”

As soon as Chen Ping heard this, she jumped up. “Oh my, I can’t believe I let you go hungry!”

After they had a meal together, Clara couldn't argue against Aunt Ping’s insistence, and the discussion about splitting the profits faded without a resolution.

Clara drove her horse cart to the house where they used to live. Even though it had collapsed, memories of Wang Rong—such a timid yet strong woman—flooded her mind.

After reminiscing for a while, Clara tied the horse to a tree at the foot of the mountain and walked towards the Mei Blossom Grove, carrying her things.

“Master, Mistress, I’m back!” Clara shouted as she entered the grove.

Completely different from her composed demeanor outside, she was like a carefree girl, full of innocence and joy.

“Yue Ke is back! Why didn’t Yuqin come with you?” Bai Zhirou exclaimed, unable to hide her happiness.

“Second sister is preparing food for tomorrow’s southward journey.”

“You’re going south?” Kan Lanzi asked curiously.

“Yes, I’m going to negotiate a seafood business.”

“You girls are so determined, but I worry you won’t take time to rest,” Bai Zhirou said with concern.

“Master, we’re fine! We’re not tired, and doing what we love brings us joy. Once we earn enough money and become wealthy, we’ll come back and live with you all in the valley,” Clara said, leaning against Bai Zhirou.

Bai Zhirou affectionately ruffled Clara’s hair.

“Be careful out there. Try to recruit talented people for your cause. If those others come for revenge, you need to have some strength to resist. If you want to take revenge, you must build your own power,” Kan Lanzi advised Clara earnestly.

“Yes, Master,” Clara promised, taking his words to heart.

After leaving Kan Lanzi, Clara headed over to the butcher, Wu, where she usually bought meat.

“What’s the young lady buying today?” Wu beamed at the sight of Clara.

The girl was charming and sweet-tongued, always flattering him and making him feel good.

“Uncle, it’s been a while since I last saw you; you look younger than before!”

“You little girl, did you eat something sweet today?”

“Uncle, you’ve really gotten younger! I’m just speaking the truth,” Clara said with a serious face.

“But today, I’m not here to buy. I want to discuss a business opportunity.”

Seeing that Clara looked sincere, Wu became curious.

“What business, girl?”

“Where do you get the pigs you sell every day?”

“To be honest, all the pigs I sell are raised by my family. My brothers and I specialize in pig farming. But sometimes, if we don’t have suitable ones, we’ll buy from local farmers.”

Clara understood and nodded.

“Uncle, I’d like your family to expand the pig farming operation—raise as many as you can, and I’ll buy them from you later.”

“You plan to sell pork?”

“I’m preparing to open a large supermarket. The first floor will be a supermarket with everything you can imagine, and I’d like your family to sell there. You’d just need to pay me rent each month. As for the extra pigs, the fourth floor will be a dedicated food area that will need a large supply.”

“Are you serious? But what if the business doesn’t go well? I might end up with pigs I can’t sell.”

“That won’t happen; the business will definitely thrive. If you’re worried, I can provide an advance payment for the pigs. When the supermarket is built, you can check it out first and then decide if you want to sell there.”

“Girl, we won’t know how it goes until later. I need to invest a lot of money to have my brothers raise more pigs. We can trust you, but they need reassurance with that advance.”

Clara understood this concern. After discussing it further with Wu, they went to his house to gather his brothers and confirm the initial number of pigs to be raised.

In the end, both sides reached an agreement, and Clara paid a deposit of thirty taels of silver.
