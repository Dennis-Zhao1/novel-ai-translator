**Buying the Foundation**

Upon returning home, Ethan Jade found that the others had already finished clearing the grass around the house and the surrounding area. He helped move the last few things just as Li An hurried off with the ox cart to the neighboring village to purchase some wooden planks.

Clara Joy and Mary Wang decided to visit the village chief's house. Before this, the three sisters, along with Chen Ping's assistance, had managed to convince Mary to change the arrangement from renting the thatched house to buying the land outright.

"Here they come," the old village chief greeted Clara and Mary with a warm nod. He then called for his son, who was destined to inherit his position as village chief. Although the chief was only a few years older than Zhou Cuihua, due to his higher standing, she respectfully addressed him as "uncle."

"What? You want to buy that piece of land?" the village chief asked, incredulous.

"You don't have much money left. If you buy the materials and then the land, you really won't have anything left," he advised after a moment of surprise.

"Mary, think it over again," he urged gently.

"Dad, just agree to it. I actually think buying it is better. That piece of land is currently vacant, and there’s plenty of wasteland around it. We could give them a fair price, and if they want to grow some vegetables, that’s fine too. Otherwise, if villagers start cultivating near the thatched house, it’ll be inconvenient for them," said Wang Fugui, the chief's son, suddenly chiming in.

People say that a widow's home is rife with gossip, especially when she has three girls around the age of twelve or thirteen. It’s better to minimize the villagers’ visits to their place. By allowing them to buy the surrounding land, it would also benefit the village financially.

"Exactly, Village Chief, while the prices are still low before anyone starts cultivating there," Clara added, nodding in agreement.

"Mary, have you thought this through?" the village chief pressed again.

"I’ll go along with what the children say," Mary replied resolutely.

So, when they left the village chief’s house, Ethan's family had acquired a large piece of land and a basket full of vegetables the chief had generously given them. However, the land deed would only be available tomorrow after the chief completed the paperwork in town.

Ethan let out a sigh, realizing just how quickly money could slip away; he had nothing left to his name now.

On the way home, Ethan encountered Zhou Cuihua chatting with someone else. Upon seeing Ethan and Mary, she deliberately made a few jabs at them, but no one paid her any mind.

After walking for a while, Ethan sensed Mary's low spirits.

"Mom?" 

Mary shook her head and forced a smile. 

"I'm fine, don’t worry. I understand that as long as we're together, that's what matters most."

Though Mary said this, Ethan could tell she was hurting inside. But the decision had been made, and he hoped she would accept it soon.

Not long after arriving home, Li An returned and immediately started working on the tables and benches. Ethan and the others joined in weaving straw mats.

Once the mats were finished, Ethan and Clara climbed up to the roof to lay down the straw, while Mary and Chen Ping continued weaving mats for the wooden planks they would sleep on at night.

Yes, they didn’t have a bed. After deciding to buy the land, Ethan had no money left for a bed, so they would have to make do with wooden planks on the floor for now.

Shu Yuyin looked around but found nothing she could help with, so she went to the small thatched house next door to wash the pots and prepare dinner.

The small thatched house was adjacent to the larger one, with a stove for two pots, a ceramic stove, and a large vat for water.

Fortunately, not far from the thatched house, there was a spring that flowed down, forming a small stream.

As everyone finished their tasks and the sky darkened, Shu Yuyin announced that dinner was ready.

They used the new table and benches Li An had made, but there were only three benches, so others had to find stones to sit on while they ate.

"Tomorrow, I’ll have your dad come over to make you more benches and put up a fence around the area," Li An suggested.

"That would be too much trouble for him, and it might delay his work in town," Mary said, feeling embarrassed.

Chen Ping comforted Mary with a gentle pat, "Even if it takes a day or two, it’s the least I can do to help you."

Tears brimmed in Mary’s eyes as she wanted to say that this was already more than enough.

Ethan and the others shared this sentiment, understanding that it’s easy to be generous when times are good, but rare to find someone who lends a hand in times of need. They truly felt the weight of this kindness.

As the moon rose high in the sky, a rustling sound came from outside the thatched house.

Ethan and the others quickly opened their eyes, while Mary, perhaps too exhausted from worries and work, remained in a deep sleep.

"What are you doing here at this hour?" Ethan and Clara found Song Qingqing shivering in the cold as they stepped outside.

"I heard around noon that you moved out from your grandmother's place. I wanted to come help you, but my mom sent me up the mountain and I didn’t have time. I snuck out while she was sleeping, just wanted to see for myself to feel at ease," Song Qingqing stammered, her teeth chattering.

Ethan felt a wave of warmth in his heart for the girl, and even Clara managed a rare smile, albeit hidden in the dark.

"By the way, I picked some mushrooms while I was on the mountain and saved them for you. I also brought one of my spare clothes, in case you didn’t have anything to change into. You can take turns washing it," she said, offering a cold hand to Ethan.

Ethan quickly grasped Song Qingqing’s icy hand and blew warm breath on it, while Clara draped the clothes over her shoulders.

"We’ll keep the mushrooms, but you should take the clothes back. If your mom finds out, it’ll be trouble for you. Don’t worry about us; we asked the Wang family for some money to buy new ones," Ethan reassured her.

"That’s great! These next few days might be busy for you, but I’ll try to bring you some edible greens from the mountain. If I find anything, I’ll come right away to drop them off," Song Qingqing promised.

Ethan gazed at the blurry figure, genuinely happy for the original owner of this life for having such a good friend. He had initially thought of giving Song Qingqing a brand new outfit, but then remembered her mother, Ning Shi, and quickly abandoned the idea.

"Don't go out of your way to bring us things. It’s really cold at night, and you’re not dressed warmly enough. It could also alert your mom. We’ll manage; there’s no rush," Ethan said.

"Tomorrow, come find us on the mountain together," Clara suddenly suggested.

Although Ethan didn’t know what was behind Clara’s suggestion, he urged Song Qingqing to remember to come find them, trusting that Clara had her reasons.

After that, the two accompanied Song Qingqing back to her home, standing quietly by the wall to listen for any other sounds before they felt it was safe to leave.

"Yesterday, while I was on the mountain with Yuyin, we found a chestnut tree and a hawthorn tree in the western area near the inner perimeter. There’s even a small patch with sweet potato seedlings, but I didn’t want to go alone for fear of danger, and I didn’t want to give them to my mom," Clara explained before Ethan could ask why.

"If we can use these resources, we can earn some money," Ethan said, excitement blooming in his chest.

"You’re really a little money-grubber, aren’t you? Not a single penny to your name," Ethan teased, linking arms with Clara and letting out a playful sob.

"So, we need to work hard to earn some money!"
