**Night Gathering**

“Hey, turns out it was a misunderstanding! I knew Lady Jia was always kind-hearted; there’s no way she would say something like that,” one of the girls exclaimed.

“Wow, Lady Jia is really generous! She bought gifts for all of them and even gave them so much money!” another girl chimed in.

“Exactly! Lady Jia’s kindness is indeed genuine,” a third girl added.

Clara Joy accepted the money with a smile, not at all bothered by the fact that Lady Jia’s reputation had improved a bit. After all, it wasn't her who felt wronged.

“Thank you, Lady Jia! Please take care!” Clara Joy called after her as Lady Jia hurried away. Once she was out of sight, she angrily shoved away the old maid's hand.

“What were you thinking, saying that I wanted to buy them things? There are so many ways to handle this; why did you choose the dumbest one?” Lady Jia snapped.

The old maid immediately fell to her knees. “I wasn’t thinking straight! I just wanted to protect your reputation, and I spoke too freely. I deserve to be punished.”

Lady Jia looked at the trembling maid, a flicker of fear crossing her mind that someone might overhear. “Fine, I’ll let this slide this time since you were thinking of me. Just be more careful next time. Those two girls are getting an undeserved advantage.”

Clara Joy jingled the silver coins in her hand, pondering if this was just luck. On the way back, Clara Joy’s sister, Shuqing Yan, watched her giggling like a fool.

“Hahaha, the look on Lady Jia’s face was just too funny! She never expected it would actually benefit us in the end!” Shuqing Yan laughed.

“Yeah, yeah, it was hilarious! But you don’t have to keep grinning like a fool!” Shuqing Yan said, rolling her eyes.

“Oh come on, I’m just in a good mood!” Clara Joy replied cheerfully.

Shu Yuqin, having heard the news, couldn’t stop herself from laughing either. However, when she spotted Wang Rong sitting alone and looking forlorn by the stove, she felt compelled to share the news.

Clara Joy and Shuqing Yan didn’t stop her. In her past life, Shu Yuqin had no parents, and since coming here, she had indeed come to regard Wang Rong as a maternal figure. It was quite an achievement for her to have held on for this long.

“Third Sister was right to do so,” Wang Rong said, gripping Shu Yuqin’s hand tightly, then turned to Clara Joy. 

However, Clara Joy didn’t respond; she still felt a knot in her heart. Wang Rong had truly come to terms with things recently. The last time she returned home, her mother had relentlessly mocked and scorned her, making her realize she was no longer their child.

Now she only had her daughters, but she understood that they wouldn’t easily believe her again. However, if she just held her ground and didn’t make mistakes, she would eventually regain their trust. At least, after all this time, Second Sister was willing to talk to her again.

“Detecting unfavorable factors,” a voice suddenly echoed in Clara Joy’s mind, causing her to snap her eyes open.

“What’s happening?” she asked.

“I don’t know either. The system detected something, but don’t worry; there’s nothing nearby that can harm you,” the system, named Weiwei, replied, sounding puzzled.

Clara Joy couldn't trust the system entirely. She gently shook Shuqing Yan awake, and together they circled the house, but found nothing amiss.

“Don’t worry, it’s probably just a system error,” Shuqing Yan reassured her.

Yet Clara Joy still felt uneasy.

In the woods behind the Wang family, Zhou Cuihua was conversing with a group of men in black clothing.

“Let me tell you, the lady, those three girls are doing better and better; they’ve already moved out of my house, and I can’t control them anymore,” she said.

“The lady gave you so much money, not for you to make their lives difficult. How could they leave?” one of the men questioned.

“I…I…” Zhou Cuihua stammered, unable to respond.

“Never mind, useless peasant. I will report back to my lady myself,” the man said dismissively.

“But I can still keep an eye on them and pass on messages,” Zhou Cuihua protested.

“Don’t let them have it easy. Find a way to make trouble for them.”

“Uh, those girls seem to have changed completely; they’re crafty and resourceful,” Zhou Cuihua replied, feeling frustrated.

If she had any clever ideas, she wouldn’t even need to bother with them; that way, she wouldn’t be looked down upon!

“You’re useless then. You won’t be getting any money this time,” the man in black said coldly before disappearing in an instant.

Zhou Cuihua muttered a few curses under her breath as she cautiously made her way out of the woods.

“The system doesn’t make mistakes; this unfavorable factor will bring trouble in the future,” the mechanical voice of the system rang in her ears.

Who could be plotting against them? Clara Joy mentally went through the list of people she’d offended. Could it be Lady Jia? But why would she be scheming at this hour?

Forget it, Clara Joy shook her head. If it’s about the future, then let it be; for now, just focus on living well in the present.

“Let’s sleep. It’s only a matter for the future,” Clara Joy said, patting Shuqing Yan.

“Where did you go?” Wang Yuanyi suddenly asked when Zhou Cuihua returned.

“I…I just went to the restroom,” she replied.

“You were gone for nearly half an hour! You just went to the restroom?” Wang Yuanyi sounded skeptical.

Zhou Cuihua felt the weight of his suspicious gaze and remembered there were no more free funds. Anger flared within her. 

“Are you accusing me of being unfaithful? You old man! I, Zhou Cuihua, have served you diligently for almost my entire life, and you dare to doubt me?” 

Wang Yuanyi wasn’t the kind of person to self-reflect either.

“Then where did you really go?” he pressed.

This was a matter she couldn’t divulge, and Zhou Cuihua’s eyes darted around nervously.

After being together for so long, Wang Yuanyi could tell something was off. He remembered how there always seemed to be more money at home lately and that she had sneaked out in the middle of the night without explaining herself.

“Slap!” Wang Yuanyi struck Zhou Cuihua hard across the face.

Zhou Cuihua refused to admit to anything she hadn’t done, leading to a fierce argument that escalated quickly.

The commotion woke up everyone in the Wang household, who were clueless as to what the old couple was fighting about at such an hour.

The next day, when Clara Joy returned from town, she bumped into Chen Ping, who was selling hawthorn and chestnuts.

“Hey, did you hear? Last night, Wang Yuanyi and Zhou Cuihua got into another big fight. Apparently, Zhou Cuihua sneaked out last night to meet someone!” 

Zhou Cuihua was out last night? Clara Joy exchanged a glance with Shuqing Yan.

Could Zhou Cuihua be plotting against them? But who was she meeting? Was she trying to get someone to harm them?

Clara Joy couldn’t figure it out, but she felt that since they were only running a food business, the best way to sabotage them would be through their food supplies.

It seemed that they would need to be more cautious about food matters going forward.

“Ding! You’ve received a mooncake recipe reward.”

Clara Joy snapped back to reality. She hurried to her room to accept the reward.

She had been worried about how to sell the remaining hawthorn and chestnuts, and now the system had provided her a great opportunity, reminding her that the Mid-Autumn Festival was just around the corner.

However, in terms of food preparation, she and Shuqing Yan would only have the role of helpers for Shu Yuqin.

When Wang Rong wasn’t paying attention, Clara Joy secretly passed the mooncake recipe to Shu Yuqin. The next day, after selling off the chestnuts and hawthorn, they went to the blacksmith’s shop to order a large flat iron pot with a lid.

Three days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, Clara Joy’s family stopped selling hawthorn and chestnuts. She went back to town to pick up the pot and bought the ingredients Shu Yuqin needed for making mooncakes.

Shu Yuqin took charge of making the filling and dough, while Clara Joy and Shuqing Yan focused on wrapping the mooncakes. As for Wang Rong, Shu Yuqin thought it was best for her to keep an eye on the fire for baking the mooncakes.

Without an oven, they placed the large flat iron pot on the fire Wang Rong had prepared, putting the mooncakes inside before covering it up. They then placed burning charcoal on top of the lid.

The large iron pot Clara Joy ordered had a diameter of one meter and could hold around a hundred mooncakes at once.
