**In the Depths of the Cave, There Lies a Home**

"Beep! The host's luck value is about to be maxed out."

One day, Clara Joy returned from the county fair, her arms laden with goods from her stall, when she heard a faint sound. After giving her sisters, Ethan Jade and Shu Qingyan, a quick rundown of her plans, she headed up the mountain. 

Yet, this time, she unknowingly strayed onto a path she had never walked before. By the time she realized it, everything around her felt completely unfamiliar. However, Clara wasn’t worried; with her current luck value, she was confident she wouldn’t encounter any danger. 

Determined to find a flat rock to sit on and spend some of her luck, she searched until she finally found a stone. Behind it was a wall covered in ivy. Just as she prepared to sit comfortably, she lost her balance and fell backward. To her surprise, instead of colliding with the wall, her head passed through the ivy, and she tumbled directly into the ground. 

Clara picked herself up and realized that beneath the ivy lay a hidden cave. If it weren't for the dense growth, no one would have suspected that a small passage led into the depths of the mountain. As Clara wandered through the cave, she couldn’t help but marvel, "This place is enormous!" 

After a while, she found herself standing in front of an extremely narrow passageway. For some reason, she felt an inexplicable urge compelling her to step forward. Taking a deep breath, Clara decided to see what lay ahead. 

At first, the path was so tight that she could barely squeeze through. She walked for about fifteen minutes, and soon enough, she felt water beneath her feet. Illuminated by the flashlight provided by her system, she discovered the path widened into a small stream. The water flowed gently, and as she continued forward, she unexpectedly came upon a small boat.

Clara climbed into the boat, paddling forward, but suddenly the current picked up speed. Startled, she squeezed her eyes shut. When she finally opened them, she noticed a distinct change in her surroundings, with light streaming in from above.

After paddling for about another fifteen minutes, the scenery on the right drew her attention. A grove of plum trees spread before her; some were in full bloom, while others were still budding. The sweet fragrance wafted through the air as Clara steered the boat to the shore, stepping onto solid ground.

Breathing in the scent of the plums, she walked deeper into the grove and soon spotted a small patch of land where a man was busy tending to his crops. Every so often, he would glance toward a woman standing near the house. 

"Man plowing, woman weaving," Clara thought to herself, the phrase popping into her head unbidden. Even as an observer, she could sense the strong bond of love between the two.

"You..." The woman turned to Clara, unsure of how to approach her.

The man, hearing her voice, looked up too. Clara instantly recognized him.

"It’s you! Thank you for saving us that night!" Clara exclaimed, her gratitude flowing freely.

"Just passing through. I couldn't let those unsavory types meddle in this peaceful rural area," he replied humbly.

"But you still saved us. I owe you my thanks," she insisted.

The man fell silent, and the woman suddenly brightened, "Child, come here! How did you find your way in? This is the first time anyone has visited our little home!" Her smile was radiant, her affection for Clara evident.

Clara felt a warm sense of familiarity wash over her as she approached. 

"You’re so beautiful! You look so delicate and fragile; I would never guess you could climb the mountains!" the woman continued, her eyes sparkling.

"You’re mistaken! Though I may look delicate, my strength surpasses that of an adult man!" Clara replied with a playful grin.

An idea began to form in her mind.

"Is that so?" The woman chuckled.

Clara, growing more comfortable, shared a few jokes that had the woman laughing until her stomach hurt. The man watched, a hint of approval in his gaze, as it had been a long time since he had seen his wife so genuinely happy.

Seeing her moment, Clara suddenly knelt before the man. 

"Please, sir, take me as your disciple and teach me martial arts," she implored.

The man scrutinized her for a moment before responding slowly, "Training in martial arts requires time and dedication. Besides, you’re already a bit older; you've missed the prime age for training."

"I’m willing to work a hundred times harder than anyone else. I just hope you’ll agree to teach me," Clara urged, her determination evident.

The man remained silent, and Clara, equally stubborn, stayed kneeling.

Finally, it was the woman who couldn’t bear to see Clara begging, pulling her up gently. 

"Child, give him some time to think about it," she advised.

"The sun is setting. You must be from one of the nearby villages. If you don’t return soon, your family will surely worry," she added.

But Clara stood firm, "Sir, I truly need to learn martial arts. I don’t want to be like a fish on a chopping board, waiting to be slaughtered."

"Please," she pleaded, kneeling once more, her expression resolute.

The man furrowed his brows, deep in thought.

"I can heal your wife’s leg," Clara stated suddenly.

"What did you say?" The man’s expression shifted to alarm.

While chatting with the woman earlier, Clara had noticed the limp in her gait.

"I can heal your wife’s leg," she repeated confidently.

"You’re just a farmer’s girl. How could you possibly know medicine?" he questioned skeptically.

"I had a master who taught me. Unfortunately, he has gone missing, and it's been hard for me to find him. Very few know that I have these skills. But I’m sure I can cure your wife’s ailment," Clara declared with conviction.

“Dear…” The woman’s voice trembled as she called to her husband, tears brimming in her eyes.

"Fine. If you can guarantee you can heal my wife, I’ll teach you. And not just you; I can teach your two sisters as well," the man finally agreed, a hint of hope in his voice.

"Thank you! Thank you so much!" Clara exclaimed, her heart soaring.

"Child, get up! Can you really heal my leg?" the woman asked, her voice filled with hope.

"Rest assured, I can do it, or I wouldn’t have spoken so recklessly," Clara reassured her.

"When will you start treating my wife?" the man asked, his voice trembling slightly.

Clara, having been a doctor in her past life, understood their anxiety completely. 

"I’m not fully prepared today, but I’ll come tomorrow afternoon to treat her," she promised.

The man set down his hoe and moved to embrace his wife, whispering comforting words. 

"See, my dear? I told you your leg would heal one day. Just hold on a little longer, alright?" he murmured, his voice tender.

The woman nodded vigorously, her eyes hopeful, clearly placing all their faith in Clara.

Clara felt a surge of confidence swell within her, especially since she had just received a reward of spiritual water from the system. This water, as she learned from the system's whispers, had cost her ten points of luck value to obtain.

"Bring your two sisters along tomorrow. After I treat your wife, I’ll teach you all," the man instructed Clara.

"Okay, thank you, Master!" Clara quickly corrected herself, worried he might change his mind.
