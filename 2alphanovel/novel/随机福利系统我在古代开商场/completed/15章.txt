**Opening Up the Heart**

“Mom, I know you’re feeling really down, but I hope you can pull yourself together for us, okay?” Clara Joy said, holding onto Wang Rong’s hand with a heart full of compassion.

“Mom, please don’t be upset. You still have your lovely Er Ni! We’ll make sure you live a good life from now on!” Shu Yuqin chimed in, cuddling up to Wang Rong and speaking sweetly.

Wang Rong gently combed through Shu Yuqin and Clara Joy’s hair, managing a faint smile. Then, she extended her hand towards the silent Shu Qingyan, who had been quietly observing.

“Da Ni, it’s because I didn’t protect you well before. Please don’t blame me, alright?”

“Just cheer up. Let’s all work together to make our lives better,” Shu Qingyan replied, her expression unchanged, devoid of any warmth.

Wang Rong let out a silent sigh within. How she wished she could be more optimistic, but a lump in her throat made it hard for her to breathe freely. Despite reassuring herself countless times, her parents' attitudes still cut deep.

Watching her mother, who remained quiet, Shu Qingyan’s face shifted from concern to indifference.

“If you can’t cheer up, we’ll just move back tomorrow, and afterward, we can all go back to being someone else’s servants.”

Wang Rong’s heart raced at those words, panic setting in.

“No, we won’t! It’s my fault, Da Ni, please don’t be mad at me!”

“You moving out like this and expecting us to care about your feelings just isn’t right. It would be better if you hadn’t moved out at all,” Shu Qingyan snapped, frustration boiling over.

“Besides, if she could sell us off to the dead, you think she wouldn’t do something like that?” 

Wang Rong fell silent, rendered speechless by the harsh truth in Shu Qingyan’s words. 

In Shu Qingyan’s eyes, Wang Rong was the epitome of someone with a masochistic tendency. She would serve others, getting scolded and beaten, yet still willingly endure it.

“If you can handle it, fine. But if you can’t, we’re moving back tomorrow, and you’ll go alone.”

Wang Rong’s lack of a change in attitude only fueled Shu Qingyan’s anger further. Initially, she had mentioned moving back to provoke Wang Rong, but now, suggesting she go alone was serious.

Deep down, Shu Qingyan didn’t have much affection for her. Perhaps without the burden of their mother, the three sisters could do better.

Watching Shu Qingyan leave after her outburst, Wang Rong felt a wave of grievance wash over her. She turned to Clara Joy and Shu Yuqin but found that neither offered her any comfort. Instead, they stood and walked away, leaving her with a simple, “Mom, think it over yourself.”

“Come on, it’s time for breakfast! I made you all something good. And I saw you brought back so many chestnuts and hawthorns yesterday—what are you planning to make with them?” Wang Rong called out early the next morning, walking into the room where Clara Joy and the others were still sleeping.

After much thought last night, she felt she had come to an understanding. Her parents’ constant actions, with her father’s tacit approval, made it clear that they simply didn’t care about her.

It made sense; she was an outsider, an out嫁女. People often said that a married daughter was like spilled water, hard to reclaim.

Thus, her priority now should be to manage her own small family, and as a mother, she had an even greater responsibility.

As Clara Joy and the others rose, they noticed the worry etched less deeply on Wang Rong’s face, signaling that she had finally come to terms with her situation.

“Da Ni, I figured it out. You’ve had to worry about the house lately,” Wang Rong said, picking up a comb and beginning to style Shu Qingyan’s hair.

“As long as you’ve figured things out, that’s good,” Shu Qingyan replied curtly, though her heart was tumultuous. It struck her how her mother in her previous life had never once styled her hair.

“Mom did my hair, so I want mine done too!” Shu Yuqin exclaimed, always seeking affection from Wang Rong.

“Okay, okay, one at a time,” Wang Rong laughed, trying to keep the mood light.

Seeing the moment right, Clara Joy pulled out the pouch she had been holding.

“This is the money from selling the Chinese knotweed yesterday. Please take it, Mom.”

But Wang Rong pushed the money back to her. “You keep it. As long as you sisters know about it, that’s enough. I don’t want to take your money; what if your grandmother finds out? I wouldn’t be able to protect it.”

Upon hearing this, Clara Joy realized Wang Rong was being honest, so she didn’t insist. After all, her space was the safest option.

“Come out, Wang Shi! Get out here!”

After breakfast, as Clara Joy’s family was getting ready to make hawthorn snowballs and candied chestnuts, an angry voice called from outside their enclosure.

“Oh, it’s Qingqing’s mom! What’s going on?” Clara Joy said, her curiosity piqued.

The family stepped outside, but Wang Rong was the first to greet the newcomer. 

Seeing Ning Shi’s furious expression, along with a throng of villagers behind her, Clara Joy quickly sensed trouble brewing and pieced together the situation in her mind.

“Did your family sell medicinal herbs yesterday? I heard you made a lot of money,” Ning Shi demanded.

Wang Rong nodded, understanding it was no secret; the village likely knew by now.

“Yes, we did sell some herbs.”

“Someone saw your three kids taking my Qingqing up to the mountain yesterday. Why didn’t she get a share of that money?” Ning Shi pressed, eyes blazing.

Standing beside her mother, Song Qingqing tugged at her sleeve. “Mom, I told you, the knotweed was found by San Ni. I wasn’t there; I went to dig sweet potatoes instead.”

Ning Shi, furious at Qingqing’s rebuttal, shoved her aside. “You see? Others think you’re soft and meek, so they’ll bully you!” she scolded, pointing at Qingqing’s forehead.

“I don’t care; my Qingqing was on the mountain with you, so she deserves a share. Maybe she brought you good luck, allowing you to find the knotweed!” Ning Shi insisted, pushing Qingqing away again.

“Qingqing’s mom, that’s not how it works. San Ni found the knotweed, and besides, do you think it’s fair for your family to share the money if your husband earns it? Just because we live in the same village doesn’t mean he owes anyone anything,” Wang Rong countered firmly.

This revelation opened Clara Joy’s eyes wide. She hadn’t expected Wang Rong to have such a strong side.

Raising an eyebrow, Clara Joy realized she wouldn’t need to step in—Wang Rong was handling it well.

“Why should my husband share his earnings with the villagers?” Ning Shi replied instinctively.

“Exactly! So there’s no reason for us to share what San Ni found. If everyone thought like you, I’d have to follow them up the mountain, expecting to get a share of whatever they find!” Wang Rong continued, her voice unwavering.

With that, Wang Rong effectively silenced the village gossipers who thrived on drama.

“That’s right; there’s no logic in that!”

“Things found individually shouldn’t be shared. It doesn’t make sense.”

Some villagers, understanding the situation or fearing Wang Rong’s retaliatory spirit, readily agreed.

Ning Shi, realizing she’d walked into a trap, found herself at a loss for words, caught in a dilemma. As she glared at Song Qingqing, who stood beside Clara Joy, it seemed the floodgates of her embarrassment were about to burst.
