**Buying Song Qingqing**

In the following days, Clara Joy's family busied themselves preparing ingredients at home. Shuyuqin also made both clear oil and tomato-flavored hot pot bases. 

On the day before they were set to sell in the county, Clara Joy invited Chen Ping and Song Qingqing to help thread the skewers. In the afternoon, Li An delivered three hundred bamboo tubes. That evening, everyone gathered to enjoy a rabbit hot pot, complete with both spicy and clear broth, leaving Chen Ping's son, Li Hongshun, who came home from school, thoroughly satisfied.

After dinner, Song Qingqing pulled Clara Joy aside. 

"Hey, Clara, how much money do I have left with you?" 

Clara Joy raised an eyebrow, sensing something important was on Song Qingqing's mind. 

"Just a moment, let me check," she replied, heading to her room. In reality, she was just pretending to look for the money; after getting the storage bag, she had stashed all the cash inside it.

"There's about two taels and twenty wen," Clara Joy announced as she returned, looking at Song Qingqing. "Can you count it and see if that's right?"

Song Qingqing shot her a glare. "Do you think I don't trust you?"

She stared at the jar full of coins with a sigh. 

"What's wrong?" Clara Joy asked, noticing her friend's expression.

"My mother is planning to sell me to a widower soon. I wanted to use my money to buy myself back, but this amount is too little. My mother won’t agree." 

Ah, so that was it! 

"Don't worry, I have money. I can lend it to you," Clara Joy said, wrapping an arm around Song Qingqing's shoulder. 

It was hard not to notice how well Song Qingqing had developed; Clara Joy couldn’t help but admire her friend's figure, feeling a twinge of envy mixed with something else.

Song Qingqing simply gazed at Clara Joy, her eyes filled with unspoken gratitude, completely unaware of Clara's lingering gaze.

"Okay, I'll borrow it. I promise to pay you back slowly," Song Qingqing replied.

"Of course, that’s fine," Clara Joy said, swallowing hard. 

Let’s not get the wrong idea; she was still into guys, but she appreciated beauty in all forms.

The next day, Clara Joy and Shuqing Yan set up their stall in the county, while Shuyuqin and Chen Ping helped with the skewers. Clara Joy felt confident that even without any marketing strategy, they would sell well. Just the aroma alone made her crave more.

After setting up the stall and lighting the charcoal, Clara Joy began boiling the three different flavors of hot pot base. As the pots bubbled away, the enticing fragrance quickly spread through the area.

"Girl, what are you selling? It smells amazing!" an older man approached.

"Uncle, we’re selling hot pot skewers, but we just started cooking. It’ll be a little while before you can buy," Clara Joy replied, noting the man’s well-off appearance.

"How long will it take? If you take any longer, I might just drool away!" he joked, clearly intrigued by the delicious scent.

"This won’t take long, Uncle. Just a little bit more time," Clara Joy assured, continuing to add ingredients to the pots.

Seeing that more and more people were drawn in, the man worried about losing his spot and smiled at Clara Joy, "Then I’ll just sit here and wait. Do you have a bench?"

Clara Joy handed him her own bench. 

The man began chatting with her, and through their conversation, Clara Joy learned his surname was Zhang. He was a traveling merchant who knew about various places and could even provide items from beyond the borders.

"Alright, it's done! You can all come buy now. Meat skewers are two wen each, and vegetable skewers are one wen each," Clara Joy announced brightly.

Each skewer didn’t have too many pieces, which allowed for a lower price, but they would still earn a fair profit.

"Hey girl, hurry up and serve me first!" the man urged.

Clara Joy handed him a bamboo tube. "Just pick what you want and put it in here, then head over to my sister to settle the bill."

"I want some of all three flavors," Uncle Zhang said, clearly eager.

Clara Joy handed him two more bamboo tubes. As more customers gathered around, she stood back to ensure no one tried to sneak away without paying.

Shuqing Yan was busy calculating the bills, barely able to keep up as the skewers varied in length for easy identification. Meanwhile, Clara Joy continuously added more ingredients to the pots, ensuring no one had to wait too long.

Originally, Clara Joy planned to sell for the whole day, but by noon, they had already sold out. 

And so it went for the next half month; each day, business was booming, and they sold out before noon every time.

One day, as Clara Joy and her companions entered the village, they spotted a crowd gathered around something. They could hear their mothers, Chen Ping, and Song Qingqing among the noise.

“I’m not marrying him! He’s way too old! Are you trying to push me into a fire pit, mother?” 

“You silly girl, what are you talking about? Age brings wisdom; I’m doing this for your own good!” Ning, Song Qingqing’s mother, insisted, tugging at her daughter to come closer to the older men.

“Don’t think I don't know what’s going on. You and dad just want to sell me off to make money for my brother's education!” Song Qingqing shot back, her voice filled with defiance.

The villagers had been whispering among themselves, but Song Qingqing's bold statement silenced them, revealing common views that daughters were less valuable than sons, and sacrificing a daughter for a son’s future was deemed normal.

“Qingqing’s mother, this is about your daughter’s future happiness; you should really think this through,” Wang Rong spoke up, unable to comprehend why a mother wouldn’t care for her child.

“Exactly! Even if she has to marry, it should be for a respectable family,” Chen Ping added.

“This is my family’s business; why do you all care so much? If I don’t marry her off, are you going to pay for my son’s education?” Ning retorted angrily.

“But Qingqing earns twenty wen a day at my place!” 

“Your work isn’t guaranteed every day, while my future son-in-law is offering eight taels of silver!” Ning dismissed them, showing no sign of compromise.

Wang Rong didn’t want to back down either. She figured if she could just delay things until Clara Joy returned, surely there would be a way to save Qingqing.

“Eight taels of silver for marrying off your daughter to a man older than her father? It makes me wonder if you even care for her at all!” Shuyuqin chimed in from behind Wang Rong, defending Song Qingqing.

Wang Rong immediately tugged at Shuyuqin, trying to quiet her.

“Qingqing’s mother, we need Qingqing to work this winter. It would add up to quite a bit of money,” Wang Rong insisted.

Ning snorted, clearly looking down on the idea.

“Don’t meddle in my family’s affairs. Can your offers compare to eight taels of silver?”

“Can you do better? How about nine taels of silver?”
