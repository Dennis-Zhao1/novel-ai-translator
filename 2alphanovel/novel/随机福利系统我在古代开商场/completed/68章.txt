**Chapter One: Unexpected Encounters**

As the last of the crowd dissipated, and the figures of people faded into the distance, Clara Joy pushed Ethan Jade away with a sudden burst of frustration. Straightening her clothes and smoothing down her hair, she tried to act as if nothing had happened, preparing to make her escape. But before she could take a step, Ethan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist firmly.

"Where do you think you're going without paying?" he demanded, his voice a mix of annoyance and authority.

"Come on, Ethan, we saved her last time, remember? You said she owed you five hundred taels," Clara shot back, peering over her shoulder at the retreating figures.

Ethan's scowl deepened. "That's right, and it’s time for her to settle up. No money, no running off."

Clara bit her lip, a resigned look crossing her face. "I don't have that kind of money right now. Can I just owe you?"

"Not a chance. If you do, I’ll go find those people and bring them back," Ethan threatened, his eyes narrowing.

At that, Clara's bravado crumbled. "No, please! I’ll get you the money right now!" she pleaded, desperation creeping into her voice.

With a heavy heart, she reached into her hidden storage space, pulling out a thousand taels with a pained expression. "Here, take it."

"You're still short by two hundred taels," Ethan pointed out, his tone unyielding.

Clara grimaced, her lips pressing into a pout as she cursed under her breath. "Fine, take it." She handed over the coins, turning her head away in an attempt to ignore the painful reality.

"Good job, Clara. Now, Ethan, take the money and thank the lady," he instructed.

"Thank you, Miss," Ethan said, his tone dripping with mock politeness.

Clara rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Next time you have such a good deal, you can come find me!"

She turned her back on them, her annoyance palpable, while Ethan strode away, unfazed. Clara watched him go, her foot tapping the ground in irritation. 

"Are you okay, Clara?" her sister, Shu Yuqin, asked gently, concern etched on her face.

"No, I'm not! That’s a thousand taels gone!" Clara wailed, her expression one of sheer distress.

"Alright, alright, let’s not dwell on it. Just let it go," Shu Yuqin soothed, patting Clara's back in a comforting gesture. Clara had always been a bit of a money-grubber, and it seemed nothing could upset her more than losing a small fortune.

With her spirits dampened, Clara had no desire to linger any longer. She wanted to return and count her dwindling savings. "Autumn, you stay. Yu Jin and I will head back."

"I’m going home first," Clara muttered, her voice lacking the usual cheer.

"Go on, don’t think too much about it. Just treat it like you fed the dogs." 

"Right! Just feeding the dogs. That makes it easier to swallow. But I’m still going back." 

As Clara walked along the path back to the inn with Yu Jin, she refrained from making any additional purchases due to their language barrier.

Suddenly, "Hiss..." 

"Watch out, Miss!" Yu Jin cried, her voice laced with urgency as she spotted Clara, who was obliviously walking with her head down.

Realizing too late, Clara quickly sidestepped, just as a rider thundered past, completely oblivious to the people around him. The crowd scattered, but Clara’s attention was drawn to a girl standing frozen in the middle of the street, wide-eyed and helpless.

Without a second thought, Clara sprinted forward, grabbing the girl just in time to pull her out of harm's way as the horse barreled past.

"Are you alright?" Clara asked, concern flooding her voice.

The rider, visibly irritated, shouted something at Clara, words that didn’t need translation — they were clearly curses directed at her.

But Clara didn’t want to escalate the situation. She turned her focus back to the girl. "Are you okay?"

"Thank you for saving me," the girl replied, her voice trembling.

Clara took a moment to truly see the girl — she was breathtakingly beautiful, with a natural grace that made her seem almost ethereal. The girl had delicate features, a soft complexion, and a gentle aura that drew Clara in.

"Are you sure you're alright?" Clara pressed, her heart aching with empathy.

"Really, I’m fine. Thank you for your concern," the girl said, blushing slightly as she lowered her gaze, feeling the intensity of Clara’s stare.

Clara’s heart raced as she realized how entranced she was by the girl. "Please, no need to bow in gratitude. I couldn't let anything happen to you."

The girl smiled shyly, her expression warming Clara’s heart even more.

"Do you live around here? Let me escort you back to ensure your safety," the boy who had been with the girl suggested, his demeanor earnest.

The siblings exchanged a glance before the boy spoke again. "We live in a dilapidated house at the end of the alley. It’s not much, but it’s home."

"What about your parents? Are they with you?" Clara inquired, her curiosity piqued.

"Our mother passed away, and our father remarried in Nanyan. He doesn’t care for us anymore," the girl replied, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Clara felt a pang of sympathy at the revelation. "I’m so sorry to hear that. I didn’t mean to bring up painful memories."

The girl quickly wiped away her tears. "It’s alright. We get by on the kindness of strangers."

"Would you consider coming with me? I can’t promise riches, but I can ensure you won’t have to worry about food and clothing," Clara offered, feeling an urge to help.

The boy and girl exchanged thoughtful glances. "We’re grateful, but I don’t want to put my sister in a position of servitude," he said, his protective instincts kicking in.

"You wouldn’t have to serve me. Consider it a job. Think it over, and if you decide to join me, I’ll need a way to contact you," Clara urged, her determination clear.

"Let us return home and discuss it. If we choose to come with you, we’ll find you," the boy replied, his expression serious.

Clara nodded, acknowledging their need for time to think. They made their way to the inn together. 

"This is our place," Clara said, gesturing to the establishment.

"You haven’t eaten lunch yet, have you? Let me order some food for you two. Afterward, you can head back," Clara said, her kindness shining through.

She now knew their names — the boy was A-Ping, and the girl was A-Yi.

As Clara placed the order, she stood by the innkeeper, waiting for the calculation, but before the innkeeper could finish, A-Ping had already calculated it.

"That’ll be two hundred and twenty-seven wen," A-Ping stated confidently.

"Wow, you’re fast!" Clara remarked, raising her eyebrows in admiration. A-Ping was proving to be quite useful.

With a business in need of a manager, Clara realized A-Ping could fit the role perfectly. If she could bring them along, it would solve her staffing issues.

Returning to her room, she retrieved some funds from her storage space. After the last haul from Tianfeng Stronghold, she still had around six thousand taels left.

"Tomorrow, I’ll negotiate some business and get home early. There are too many places out here that drain your money." Clara resolved, a determined glint in her eye as she planned for the future.
