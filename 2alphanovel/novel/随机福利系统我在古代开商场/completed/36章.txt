**Initial Plan**

“Alright, I have a total of ten roots available. If you want them all, it'll be five thousand taels,” Clara Joy said with a breezy confidence.

Five thousand taels? Ethan Jade felt stunned by the number.

“Don’t worry, Young Master Xu, you won’t be taken advantage of. We can go to a medical clinic to verify the goods,” Clara assured him.

Seeing Clara’s unwavering certainty about the price eased Ethan’s doubts. However, he realized that being at home had never earned him any affection, and all his savings barely amounted to five thousand taels. If he spent it all and didn’t gain his family’s favor, he would end up losing both his position and resources.

“Think it over, Young Master Xu. If these ginseng roots can win you your family's attention, you could return to the capital. Then, five thousand taels would be mere pocket change for you,” Clara said nonchalantly.

Ethan was completely unaware that he was being led by the nose by Clara Joy.

He imagined being valued, receiving praise from his family, and getting an increase in his monthly allowance. Gradually, his eyes lit up with hope.

“Okay, I’ll buy them all.”

“Great! But you probably don’t have that much money on you right now. I don’t have the ginseng with me either, so let’s head home to collect it. We’ll meet back here in half an hour.”

After watching Ethan leave, Clara Joy excitedly patted Yan Xu’s arm. 

This feeling of happiness was exhilarating—she had just earned a hefty sum from someone she didn’t particularly like, and they were grateful to her for it.

“Master, you seemed really angry at first. Why did you end up being so friendly with Young Master Xu?” Yan Xu asked, puzzled.

“Ah, my dear disciple, you don’t understand. I was upset because he crossed my bottom line. But later, we’re in the business of commerce. It’s best not to offend anyone. We should speak appropriately to everyone, and even turn those we dislike into our customers. That way, we can earn their money—that’s what we should learn,” Clara paused and blinked playfully.

“The most important part is that I get to make money off him. It feels so good!” Clara Joy said, fighting back laughter.

Though she might not be a model merchant, this was simply who she was, and how she operated was learned from observing others in her past life.

Yan Xu nodded, beginning to understand Clara’s perspective as a merchant. First, have a bottom line. Second, avoid offending anyone, transforming those you dislike into customers to earn from them, and find joy in that.

If Clara knew about Yan Xu's summary, she would surely have praised him, but…

Upon returning home, Clara Joy found Zhang Lanlan sitting in the middle of the courtyard, looking forlornly at the door.

“Master, Brother Yan Xu, you’re finally back!” Zhang exclaimed.

Seeing her, Yan Xu instinctively wanted to flee, but Clara grabbed him.

“You need to learn to face problems instead of running away from them. Besides, she’ll be your junior sister from now on, so you can’t escape,” Clara said, mercilessly.

Yan Xu immediately wilted.

“Brother Yan Xu, from now on we can follow Master together. Aren’t you happy?” Zhang blinked her big eyes, completely ignoring the displeasure on Yan Xu's face.

Yan Xu felt utterly helpless but still nodded. He knew that if he shook his head, Zhang would likely burst into tears.

“I knew Brother Yan Xu would be the best!”

Clara Joy paid no mind to their exchange. She found an excuse to retreat to her room and retrieved the ten ginseng roots.

Then she took Yan Xu and Zhang Lanlan to exchange them for five thousand taels in silver notes.

Once they got home, Clara accepted Zhang Lanlan's serious bow of apprenticeship and her gift. Among the items, a plush doll caught Clara’s eye.

“Master, isn’t this pretty? I made it myself!” Zhang said, following Clara’s gaze.

“It really is nice, your skills are commendable,” Clara replied.

But Zhang didn’t seem to acknowledge Clara’s compliment, instead sticking close to Yan Xu and calling him “senior brother” over and over.

Clara sighed and looked at Shu Qingyan and the others.

“I might just be a stepping stone on her road to romance,” Clara mused.

Shu Qingyan and the others exchanged sympathetic glances, clearly saying, “As long as you know.”

That evening, Clara Joy called Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin to her room. She laid out all the money on the table—a total of over six thousand six hundred taels.

“This money belongs to the three of us. It should have been divided between you two earlier.”

“Now, each of you will get two thousand two hundred taels, and the remaining few taels will go into the communal fund for buying supplies. How does that sound?”

Clara placed two thousand two hundred taels in front of each of them.

“But most of this is what you earned, Master! You collected the ginseng yourself, and big sister and I barely know it, yet you sold it,” Shu Yuqin protested.

Hearing this, Clara’s mood soured.

Shu Qingyan knew Clara would soon start lecturing them about fairness.

“Fine, then I’ll just take it with my second sister. If you need money, just let us know,” Shu Qingyan said, and this made Clara smile again.

She thought of how in her previous life, after every payday, they would happily embrace each other, and it was the same now.

“Let’s all sleep together tonight. It’s been a while since we had a good chat,” Clara said, playfully pouting at the two.

“Sure! I love sleeping with you all!” Shu Yuqin exclaimed.

Clara and Shu Qingyan exchanged glances, their lips twitching. They wondered how squished they would end up being, especially since Shu Yuqin had a notoriously awful sleeping posture.

But they were happy nonetheless.

“What are your thoughts about what’s next?” Shu Qingyan asked Clara, lying on the bed.

“Well, you know beauty treatments, and playing mahjong, and other leisure activities. My second sister cooks a variety of delicious dishes, and I saw that the cute stuffed toy Lanlan gave me was made by her. So, I think we can open a large shopping mall,” Clara suggested.

“We also need to have our own influence; otherwise, we can’t protect our business.”

Shu Qingyan always provided detailed advice for Clara.

“Exactly! We’ll recruit many people to work for us,” Clara replied.

Listening to Clara and Shu Qingyan talk, Shu Yuqin couldn’t interject a word, but she nodded repeatedly, her mind wandering off to what kind of food she could sell later.

“For the first shopping mall, we probably can’t manage it all ourselves, so we can bring in some investments,” Clara continued with her ideas.

In her mind, the mall would have five floors: the first for a supermarket, the second for a children’s area, the third for adults, the fourth for food, and the fifth for leisure.

Clara was well aware that implementing all this would require a significant amount of money and time, but once the mall opened, it wouldn’t just cater to the townspeople but also attract visitors from surrounding towns and villages.

Even before they expanded to other counties, people from neighboring counties would be drawn in.

“We can definitely become the wealthiest in the country,” Clara declared.

At that moment, the three girls’ ambitions were magnified.

“Let’s go for it! Let’s go for it!”
