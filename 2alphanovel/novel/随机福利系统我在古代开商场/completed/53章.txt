### Robbers on the Road

That day, as the night enveloped the surroundings, Clara Joy was making her way home. Before she could reach her door, she spotted her sisters, Clara and Autumn, waiting outside.

“You’re finally back! Next time, you have to bring Autumn along,” Clara said, her tone sharp.

Clara Joy jumped off her horse and handed the reins to Autumn. “I know, I know. I made it back just fine, didn’t I? Come on, don’t look so glum,” she pouted playfully at Clara.

“Seriously, you have to travel tomorrow, and yet you’re still out having fun,” Clara rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed.

“I had to make sure everything was in order. There’s just so much to do.”

Early the next morning, Clara Joy and the others packed their belongings, ready to set off.

“Master, I’ve come to see you off,” Yan Xu rode up on horseback.

“Perfect timing! I have something for you,” Clara Joy said, pulling out five thousand taels of silver from her bag and handing it to Yan Xu. 

“Take some time over the next couple of days to head to town and check on the workshop. I asked Xia Ling to expand it, and she might not have enough funds. Please deliver some money for her. Also, check on the shopping plaza that’s under construction. If there’s any shortage with Old Tu’s funds, just give him some from this.”

“Understood,” Yan Xu replied solemnly as he accepted the money. 

“The family is counting on you and Lan Lan. I really appreciate your help,” Clara Joy felt a pang of guilt toward Yan Xu and Zhang Lan Lan; after all, she hadn’t taught them much yet was now asking them to help look after the family.

“Stay safe on your journey and come back soon. I’ll be waiting for you here,” Yan Xu said, his usual playful demeanor replaced with seriousness.

“Got it, we’re off now.”

With Shu Xin driving the cart, Clara Joy, Clara, and Autumn settled inside. Curiously, Shu Xin, having heard that boys and girls should keep their distance, refused to sit with them this time.

After passing through two towns, they noticed the sun was still high in the sky and decided to press on.

“Master, the road ahead is narrow, and the woods on both sides are thick,” Autumn said, pulling back the curtain of the cart to report on the conditions ahead.

“Stay alert; this area is known for bandits,” Clara Joy replied casually, munching on sunflower seeds.

“This path is mine to tread, these trees I’ve planted. If you wish to pass, leave behind some road money,” suddenly, their cart was blocked.

Clara Joy and the others stepped down from the cart at the sound of a voice, only to find a group of men standing before them, spreading out to surround them.

“Two, two leaders! It’s all ladies,” the men’s eyes lit up as they spotted Clara Joy and her companions.

“Are you planning to pass through? Hand over the money!” one of the men barked.

“What’s the amount?” Clara Joy kept a smile on her face.

“Five hundred taels,” the man, referred to as the second-in-command, replied.

“Not a chance! Five hundred taels? Are you dreaming?” Clara’s face turned crimson with anger.

“If you don’t want to pay, that’s fine. You can come with us to the village and serve our lord as you please,” the second-in-command said, a smirk on his face, his speech dragging on.

The other bandits erupted in laughter at his words.

Clara Joy’s expression darkened. She had intended to negotiate a lower amount and avoid conflict, but these men were not only greedy but shameless as well.

“What if we refuse?”

The second-in-command sneered, glancing at his comrades. “Oh, that’s not an option. Now, we not only want money but also a few of you pretty ladies.”

“Just imagine being pinned to a bed, oh…” 

“Smack!” Before he could finish, Shu Xin kicked him hard.

As the second-in-command got back up, he looked at Clara Joy and the others with a hostile glare.

“Since you ladies are being so uncooperative, don’t blame us for being rough,” he warned, then shouted to his men, “Brothers, charge! Since these ladies don’t know their place, let’s teach them a lesson.”

Clara Joy and her companions quickly spread out. All of them had martial arts skills, so protecting each other wasn’t necessary, making it easy to fight back. This was also Clara Joy and Clara’s first real training in combat.

The bandits, though organized and somewhat skilled, were no match for Clara Joy and her friends. Within fifteen minutes, they had all been knocked down.

Still not satisfied, Clara Joy approached the second-in-command and slapped him twice across the face. “Next time, keep that mouth clean.”

With that, Clara Joy and her companions climbed back into the cart and left without looking back.

Upon arriving in Tong’an County, they found an inn to settle down for a moment and prepare to explore.

However, their path was blocked at the door.

“Are you the ones who hurt our second-in-command?” said a man with a scar across his face.

“Yes, it’s them, third-in-command. I was with Er Gouzi on the way to find the second-in-command when we saw them fighting. We couldn’t handle it, so I sent Er Gouzi back to report while I followed them,” another man said.

Clara Joy noticed that the other guests in the inn were frightened and hiding under tables because of these men.

“You ladies have quite the fiery tempers. I just love to teach women a lesson,” the third-in-command taunted.

“Let’s take this outside,” Clara Joy said firmly and pushed past the group, wanting to avoid any collateral damage.

“Interesting!” the third-in-command remarked, following her outside.

Before he could say much, Clara Joy launched into an attack. However, the third-in-command was no pushover; his skills far surpassed those of the second-in-command, and they fought to a standstill.

It was Clara who eventually handled the lackeys trying to sneak up on them, allowing Clara Joy to finally bring down the man.

With her sword pressed against the third-in-command’s neck, Clara said, “You’d better get lost.”

As the third-in-command was helped up by the remaining standing lackeys, he glared fiercely at Clara Joy and her friends.

“I’m sorry, but you’ve offended the people of Tianfeng Village. We can’t let you stay here any longer.”

Once the men left, the innkeeper hurried to Clara Joy and her companions.

“Are you afraid of them?”

“They don’t care for right or wrong and cause trouble wherever they go. If they’re displeased by anything, they punish those who offend them. If I were to shelter you after today’s incident, my inn would surely close, and I wouldn’t be able to survive.”

Clara Joy’s face darkened as she and her companions retrieved their belongings, preparing to find another place to stay.

To their dismay, news had spread so quickly that not a single inn would take them in, even restaurants refused to serve them.

This highlighted just how terrified the townsfolk were of Tianfeng Village.

At that moment, Clara Joy and her friends’ spirits sank to an all-time low.

“Ding! Reward: One invisibility pill.”
