**Ice Making with Nitre**

By the time Clara Joy and the others left, the sky was already darkening.

Clara had even taken the time to give Huang Xin a makeover, concealing her stunning beauty so that no one would notice her.

Chen Zihao had arrived at the inn with Clara and the others. He went in first but soon came back out to call for Clara.

“Today’s matter really depends on Miss Clara’s help.”

“It’s no trouble at all. It’s getting late, so you should head home, Young Master Chen.”

After sending Chen off, Clara finally relaxed, rubbing her stiff smile away.

“Dealing with merchants is really exhausting.”

“That Chen Zihao is a good person,” Shu Yuqin said, helping Clara massage her face.

“Third Sister, Second Sister, you’re finally back!” Shu Xin appeared from somewhere, smiling brightly at Clara and Shu Yuqin.

Seeing Shu Xin’s pure smile made Clara feel as if her soul had been cleansed.

She instructed Qiusang to go call the innkeeper to bring two tables of food up to their room.

“For the next few days, you’ll have to share a room with Yu Jin. Also, don’t go out. Every time we eat, we’ll ask the innkeeper to bring the food to our room.”

Clara was certain that there were people from the Xue family nearby.

“Yes, I understand. Thank you, Miss Clara.”

With her worries gone, Huang Xin’s tranquil nature slowly began to show.

The next day, Clara took Qiusang and Yu Jin to the Chen family’s trading company in a carriage.

Chen Zihao had been waiting at the entrance early in the morning. When he spotted the carriage approaching, driven by Clara’s maid, he hurried over, calling for the staff inside to help bring the carriage to the stable.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, Young Master Chen.”

“I just arrived a little while ago.”

Clara was welcomed into a room at the trading company by Chen Zihao.

Once they were seated, a staff member brought in tea.

“Young Master Chen, I’m a straightforward person, so let’s skip the pleasantries and discuss business directly,” Clara said, a gentle smile gracing her lips.

“Please let me know what seafood you need.”

“All kinds of crabs, shrimp, shellfish, squid, octopus, salmon, yellow croaker, ribbonfish, sole, sardines…”

“Some of these are relatively easy to keep alive, and when we transport them, we can load them with seawater, so they should still be alive by the time they reach you. However, some are prone to dying easily, especially in this hot weather, which could lead to spoilage,” Chen Zihao explained.

“What about using ice?”

“The heat will cause it to melt. Even if we use ice for the departure from here, it will likely melt along the way.”

Clara paused for a moment, realizing that this was indeed a tricky problem.

“We could buy ice along the way, but that would be too expensive.”

“I understand.” Clara suddenly slapped the table.

“Miss Clara?”

“Sorry, sorry! I just thought of a solution and got a bit too excited.”

“What solution?”

Clara hesitated; she couldn’t just give away such a valuable idea to the Chen family for free.

“I have a very simple method for ice making. This way, we can produce ice along the journey to preserve the goods, and the materials needed for the ice are not expensive.”

Chen Zihao’s expression changed noticeably. If this method worked, they could earn significantly more money, surpassing the Xue family and quickly becoming the number one business in this port town.

“Miss, is it true that you have this method?”

“Absolutely true.” Clara’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm.

“Miss Clara, could I purchase this method from you?”

“Sell it? That wouldn’t be worth it.”

“You should know how valuable this method is for your business. How much do you plan to pay?”

“Ten thousand taels?”

There was no denying that the Chen family was indeed straightforward in their dealings; ten thousand taels was no small sum.

However…

“Its value is much more than that. Just think about it: in summer, wealthy families here will need to buy ice…” Clara didn’t finish her sentence, but she was confident that Chen Zihao would grasp the implication.

Chen Zihao narrowed his eyes. This was clearly a goldmine.

“Fifteen thousand taels.”

But Clara shook her head again.

“No sale; I want a share of the profits.”

“How does Miss Clara plan to do that?” At this point, Chen Zihao realized Clara was not going to sell the ice-making method after all.

“You can handle the ice business, Young Master Chen, and I won’t interfere. But I want thirty percent of the profits, along with thirty percent of the savings from buying ice when you deliver seafood to other merchants.”

“Although this method can earn a lot, Miss, you’re not involved in the operations. Am I not being a bit generous asking for thirty percent?”

“Not at all. Once the Chen family has more staff and expands the ice business across the country, there’s no doubt that the Chen family will be among the wealthiest in the port town, if not in the entire Southern Yan Kingdom.”

Chen Zihao was taken aback by Clara's words. He hadn’t thought that far ahead. But if Clara’s plan came to fruition, the Chen family really would rise to prominence.

“Miss Clara, even so, thirty percent is still too much. How about twenty percent?”

“Alright, deal.”

As soon as Chen Zihao finished speaking, Clara immediately agreed.

At that moment, he realized Clara had been waiting for him to make an offer!

He felt a mix of helplessness and resignation.

“Now can you tell me how to produce the ice?”

“Not yet. We need to write a contract first,” Clara said, shaking her head.

Chen Zihao couldn’t help but chuckle at Clara’s shrewdness.

He called for a servant nearby to fetch paper and ink.

“Can I tell you now?”

“Nitre ice-making.”

“Nitre?”

“Yes, Young Master, could you have someone find some nitre?”

“Of course.”

In less than fifteen minutes, Chen Zihao’s servant returned with the nitre.

Clara then had them bring two basins, one large and one small, filling both with water, but the water level in the small basin was lower than in the large basin.

Next, Clara added an appropriate amount of nitre to the large basin. As the nitre met the water, it began to react rapidly, absorbing heat from the surroundings. Soon after, the water in the small basin gradually turned to ice.

Chen Zihao watched in wide-eyed amazement as the scene unfolded before him. It was astonishingly simple.

“What do you think, Young Master? There seems to be significant business potential here.”

After a moment of calm, Chen Zihao replied, “Indeed, there is potential. However, Miss Clara, the nitre ice-making method has two major drawbacks: the quantity of nitre required is considerable, and the ice cannot be formed into blocks.”

“This method is designed for wealthy families; who among the poor or ordinary families would need ice in the summer? Although it cannot form into blocks, it’s sufficient for transporting goods, and the ice can also be used for various cold drinks. Selling in the summer will surely yield significant profits,” Clara had already considered these points when devising the nitre ice-making method.

After all, the contract had already been signed!

“Alright, let’s put aside the nitre for now and focus on the seafood business, shall we?”

Chen Zihao felt a mix of regret and anticipation in his heart, unsure whether he had come out ahead or behind in this deal, as his thoughts swirled around the prospects ahead.
