**You Have Some Nerve**

In the afternoon, after practicing martial arts, Clara Joy and her friends were surprised by the sudden appearance of Yan Xu.

“Master, my grandfather wants you all to come over for lunch tomorrow,” he announced.

“Really?” Clara asked, her eyebrows raised in curiosity.

“Yeah! About that last time you spoke to my sister, it was indeed my brother-in-law's fault. My sister has suffered for so many years because of it, but my grandfather has finally decided to help her seek justice. So, he wants to thank you by inviting your whole family over for a meal.”

Understanding the old man's intentions, Clara readily agreed.

The next day, after Yan Xu helped Clara wrap up their stall, he was about to go call for Shu Qingyan to join them. However, Shu Qingyan and her friends felt they hadn’t contributed enough and were reluctant to go.

Clara and Yan Xu tried to persuade them, but ultimately gave up.

During lunch at the Yan household, Clara maintained her graceful demeanor, engaging the elderly gentleman in conversation and making him chuckle from time to time. However, once they exited the Yan residence, Clara turned to Yan Xu with a mischievous glint in her eyes.

“My dear disciple, it’s been a while since you’ve shown your gratitude to your master.”

Yan Xu looked at her, puzzled and uncomfortable under her scrutinizing gaze. “Master, just say what you need to say. This is making me nervous.”

“Take me out for some snacks.”

“Isn't the food at home enough? Did you not enjoy the meal?” 

Suddenly feeling shy, Clara fidgeted slightly and responded, “It’s delicious, but I want to maintain a good impression in front of Grandfather Yan, right? You know how much I can eat.”

Yan Xu felt quite speechless. “So, you’re just going to use me as your excuse to indulge?”

“It’s not about using you; it’s about you showing your gratitude! I’m just concerned you’ve been feeling guilty,” Clara defended herself, her tone firm and unapologetic.

“Master, you sure have some nerve,” Yan Xu retorted.

Clara didn’t take offense at his comment; instead, she beamed with pride, which only left Yan Xu even more speechless.

Navigating through the bustling crowd, Clara led Yan Xu to a variety of snack stalls, only stopping when Yan Xu’s hands became too full to carry anything else. They then found a teahouse to settle in.

As Clara sipped her tea, savored her snacks, and listened to a reading, her view was abruptly blocked.

Before she could say a word, the group blocking her was already speaking up.

“Hey, isn’t that Young Master Yan? I heard you’re planning to go into business now.”

The leading man smirked at Yan Xu, dripping with sarcasm. “And I also heard your grandfather has made you an apprentice to a farmer. What’s it like trailing behind a woman every day?”

Laughter erupted from the others behind him, echoing through the teahouse.

Yan Xu felt his temper flare at the taunts. He stood up, ready to confront the man. “What does my family business have to do with you, Xu Ziqian?”

“Isn’t it said that scholars and farmers are at opposite ends? Young Master Yan, is your plan to make your family die of shame by taking the lowly path?” Xu Ziqian continued to mock.

He had always looked down on the academically challenged Yan Xu, yet somehow, Yan Xu thrived at home while he himself worked hard just to earn a bit of recognition from his own family.

Clara frowned at Xu Ziqian’s words. She understood that merchants held a low status in this era, but his blatant disregard for them was downright offensive.

Rising from her seat, Clara grabbed Yan Xu’s arm just as he was about to retaliate. 

“Xu Gongzi, your disdain for farmers and merchants is quite unbecoming for someone educated. If all scholars were like you, I’d have to question my respect for them.”

“Disdaining farmers? Tell me, who in this room hasn’t had ancestors who farmed? People live on food, and if you look down on farmers, you shouldn’t be eating the grain they grow.” 

“Disdaining merchants? Hmph.” Clara laughed lightly before continuing. “Can any of you honestly say you have no merchants in your family? Do you think money just appears because you study? Don’t you need to buy food and shelter from merchants?”

Her assertive voice resonated throughout the teahouse, striking every listener like a bell tolling.

“What’s lowly? In my eyes, those who only know how to read but fail to respect others are the ones wasting their education. Clearly, they’ve stuffed their knowledge into a dog’s belly.” 

Yan Xu looked at Clara, glowing with confidence, and felt genuine admiration for her. If the moment were right, he would have loved to cheer for her.

“Exactly! If I remember correctly, Xu Ziqian, isn’t your uncle in the business world? Are you not using the money he earned? It’s no wonder you look down on him; it must be why your family doesn’t appreciate your academic achievements and has sent you back home to keep your ancestors company.”

The mention of Xu Ziqian’s family situation struck a nerve. He couldn’t tolerate anyone bringing up the fact that he was unloved by his family.

He clenched his fist and swung it at Yan Xu, but Clara caught his punch.

“Xu Gongzi, as a scholar, you shouldn’t act so rudely.”

Caught off guard by Clara’s strength, Xu Ziqian found himself in a predicament, unable to move forward or backward.

“I admit I was a bit too harsh with my words. I hope Xu Gongzi won’t take offense. As for your disrespect towards your uncle, I have an idea that might help you mend that relationship.”

Xu Ziqian eyed Clara with skepticism, suspecting her suggestion wouldn’t be anything beneficial. But he knew that if word of his words reached his uncle, it would only worsen his standing in the family.

“What idea?” 

Clara released Xu Ziqian’s hand, calling over a waiter to refill their cups. After inviting Xu Ziqian to sit down, she poured him a cup of tea.

Yan Xu watched, puzzled by Clara’s unexpected shift in demeanor. Just moments ago, his master had been furious; now, she was welcoming Xu Ziqian to sit.

He tugged at Clara’s sleeve, but she simply gave him an assuring smile.

“Xu Gongzi, please have some tea. I apologize for my earlier remarks.”

Seeing her backtrack, Xu Ziqian straightened up, returning to his proud demeanor.

“Since your words have been spoken, they can’t be taken back. However, if you can do something nice for your family, it might make up for it.”

“What do you have in mind?”

“Your family has both officials and merchants; I’m sure you need to maintain connections, but I think the gift that might bring you the most trouble is what you really need to consider.”

Xu Ziqian nodded along; he remembered how his uncle had struggled to find an appropriate gift for his superior last New Year. 

Gold and silver were too direct, but everything else seemed too trivial.

“I happen to have some century-old ginseng. If Xu Gongzi is interested, I could part with it as a gesture of goodwill.”

Century-old ginseng was indeed a rare commodity. If he brought it home, it would surely bolster his standing. Plus, he wasn’t worried about being cheated; he could easily verify its authenticity at a pharmacy.

“Since the lady is so generous, I, Xu, should also apologize for my earlier behavior. How much of that ginseng do you have? I’ll buy it all.”
