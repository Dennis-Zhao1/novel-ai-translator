**Healing**

Ethan Jade shot a helpless glance at Clara Joy, wondering if this girl was really trying to latch onto him. If he had known, he wouldn't have meddled in her affairs. 

Clara noticed his skepticism and responded with even more sincerity. After all, given her age and background, it was indeed hard for people to take her seriously. 

“Mr. Yan, I swear on my life,” Clara declared firmly.

Ethan could see how serious she was, which made him adopt a more serious demeanor himself. 

“You do realize that if you worsen my grandfather’s condition, your life won’t be enough to pay for it,” he warned.

“I can give my life too,” Clara’s friend, Shu Qingyan, interjected briefly.

“I can give mine as well,” Shu Yuqin followed suit promptly.

“If Mr. Yan’s situation worsens, it will become increasingly dire. If you’re worried, I can have a doctor you trust observe, but if that’s not acceptable, then we’ll find another way to repay this kindness.” With that, Clara stepped aside, leaving Ethan to make his own choice. She felt she had said enough; anything more would be unnecessary.

Ethan furrowed his brow, feeling uncertain now. If Clara had been persistently trying to get close to him, he would have been sure of her intentions. But now, he couldn’t quite tell.

“I’ll trust you this once,” he finally said, battling with his own indecision before closing his eyes and conceding.

Once they arrived at the Yan residence, Ethan didn’t rush to have Clara treat his grandfather. Instead, he instructed them to rest for a while and to wait until the morning.

...

At dawn, Clara and the others got up from their guest room. Upon opening the door, they found a maid waiting outside.

“Misses, you’re awake! I’ll go fetch some water for you to wash up,” the maid said cheerfully.

Clara nodded politely and thanked her.

After washing up and having breakfast, Ethan sent someone to call for them. “Miss Shu, my young master requests your presence.”

Clara gestured for the person to lead the way, and the three of them followed.

In the courtyard, Ethan and his grandfather, Mr. Yan, were seated, flanked by two middle-aged men.

“Make sure to observe closely. If anything seems off, stop that girl immediately,” Ethan said sternly, his nerves clearly on edge.

Mr. Yan understood his grandson well and recognized the tension in him. He raised a hand and gave Ethan a reassuring pat to ease his anxiety.

His illness had persisted for over two months, worsening all the while. He was now drooling and struggling to speak, and rumors outside claimed he had a strange disease that numerous doctors had failed to cure. Deep down, he felt utterly hopeless.

To his surprise, this morning, his grandson mentioned a girl who claimed she could heal him. Regardless of whether it was true, Mr. Yan was willing to give it a shot, which was why he had sent for her early.

“Greetings, Mr. Yan,” the three of them said politely upon arrival.

“Th-thank you for your h-help,” Mr. Yan tried to articulate, his speech labored.

Once she received permission, Clara stepped forward to take his pulse, remaining silent and expressionless as she did so. Ethan, observing her closely, couldn’t quite discern anything remarkable.

After a while, Clara asked Mr. Yan to open his mouth for her to examine his tongue, which appeared pale with a white coating.

This action prompted the two observing doctors to nod in agreement; at least the girl knew how to take a pulse and assess symptoms.

“What’s wrong with my grandfather?” Ethan asked immediately after Clara finished her examination.

“Facial paralysis,” Clara stated succinctly. To her, she only adopted such a serious tone when treating others.

“Facial paralysis?” The two doctors exchanged puzzled glances; this was a term they had never encountered before.

“Please, Mr. Yan, step into the room. I’ll perform acupuncture,” Clara instructed.

“Could you explain how he came to have facial paralysis? Otherwise, why should we trust you?” one of the observing doctors asked.

“This is due to old age and a weakened constitution, leading to insufficient defenses and empty meridians...” Clara began to explain, her hands clasped behind her back.

The two doctors nodded repeatedly, finding her diagnosis aligned closely with their own, but Clara’s insights were more detailed, indicating her medical skills were commendable. They exchanged approving glances with Ethan.

“Why do we need to go inside? Can’t it be done here?” Ethan inquired, confused.

“After acupuncture, it’s important to avoid drafts,” Clara replied.

Once inside, the two doctors moved closer, their interest piqued.

After preparing her tools, Clara began the procedure. Her movements were swift and precise, each needle placed expertly, causing everyone around to hold their breath, afraid to disturb her. Meanwhile, Clara exuded confidence, her face glowing with determination.

Once she finished, Clara found a stool to sit on, accepting a glass of water from Shu Yuqin. Wiping the slight sweat from her forehead, she couldn’t help but sigh inwardly; this body was still too weak for her liking.

The two doctors circled around Mr. Yan, filled with questions they wanted to ask, but hesitated to break the silence as they noticed Clara’s fatigue. Having already seen her work, they knew there was no danger to Mr. Yan; their curiosity was solely regarding her medical techniques.

“If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I’ll clarify,” Clara said, lifting her gaze to encourage them.

In that moment, she felt rather pleased. The two doctors hadn’t dismissed her as just a rural girl nor belittled her skills out of fear that she might outshine them. It spared her a lot of trouble.

After explaining for a while, she went on to write out a prescription in front of them, even passing it to the two doctors for their review. They were deeply moved by her willingness to dispel their doubts, and by now, they held her in high esteem.

The two men nervously accepted the prescription. Once they finished reading, Clara carefully explained the reasons behind each medication. The doctors felt as though a fog had lifted from their minds, experiencing a sudden clarity.

Ethan narrowed his eyes, struggling to reconcile the image of these three sisters with that of simple rural girls. As he observed Clara Joy again, he was caught off guard when she caught his gaze and shot him a pointed look. Feeling embarrassed, he sheepishly rubbed his nose.

“Ahem, Miss Shu, it should be time to remove the needles for my grandfather, right?” he said, trying to steer the conversation back on track.

After removing the needles, Mr. Yan noticed a marked improvement. “Thank you, Miss, Miss Clara,” he managed to say.

Clara collected her needles, saying, “I’ll come back for a follow-up in five days.”

Ethan hastily summoned a servant to present her with a payment. “This is to thank Miss Clara.”

Clara stepped back and replied, “This time is merely a repayment of Young Master Yan’s kindness; there’s no need for payment.” Then she winked, her serious demeanor melting away. “But next time, I will need to charge a fee. My consultation fee is one tael of silver, so please be prepared, Young Master Yan.”

Ethan was momentarily taken aback, then nodded with a grin. “I’ll make sure to have it ready in advance.”
