**Unbelievable Luck, Exploding?**

By noon, Wang Rong felt somewhat distracted.

“I wonder if they sold everything. We used so much sugar—if it doesn’t sell, it’ll be a huge loss.”

Shu Yuqin, busy with her tasks, comforted her, “Just trust them. San Mei’s brain is quick; she’ll definitely sell it all.”

Yet, Wang Rong couldn’t shake off her anxiety. It wasn’t until Shu Yueke and the others returned and announced that everything had sold that she finally believed it. She walked around the ox cart a couple of times to reassure herself.

Shu Yueke counted the money, totaling twelve taels and two hundred fifty-five wen. They discussed the pricing and decided to pay Song Qingqing and Chen Ping one wen more than the market rate. They agreed on three wen for hawthorn and four wen for chestnuts.

Last time, Song Qingqing brought thirty jin of hawthorn and twenty jin of chestnuts for a total of one hundred seventy wen. This morning, she sent another ten jin of each from yesterday, amounting to seventy wen, which meant they owed her two hundred forty wen in total.

Chen Ping delivered thirty jin of each from yesterday, totaling two hundred ten wen.

Looking at the forty jin of goods they had, Shu Yueke felt a twinge of worry. It simply wasn’t enough.

“Mom, go find someone you know and tell them we’re buying hawthorn and chestnuts at market prices,” Shu Yueke finally suggested, considering the villagers who might have a surplus of these items.

These items could be stored and were likely to sell well for a while. It was crucial for their family to secure a larger house before winter set in, and this depended on their success.

Wang Rong set off and soon returned with good news—many people were willing to go up the mountain to gather the goods.

In the afternoon, as Shu Yueke and her companions were packaging the chestnuts and hawthorn prepared by Wang Rong and Shu Yuqin, a faint yet urgent voice echoed in her mind.

“Due to the inability to capture what the host desires, the system has been continuously rewarding luck points. Now, the host's luck points are full, yet the system continues to accumulate...”

“Beep beep beep! Urgent situation: host's luck points are about to explode.”

The voice grew increasingly frantic.

“Ah, the luck points are going to explode! We have to protect Mei Mei!”

“How do I consume the luck points?” Shu Yueke sensed the urgency in the voice and asked in her mind.

“Anything will do! Hurry outside, or strange phenomena will occur, like wild chickens and rabbits rushing straight into your home!”

“Beep beep beep...”

“Beep beep beep...”

“I’m going out for a bit.” Shu Yueke left that sentence behind, quickly grabbing a basket and heading out.

As she passed by the village's small river, she clearly saw fish leaping near the shore, thrashing about.

It had been a long time since she had eaten fish, and Shu Yueke swallowed hard.

Bending down, she scooped up a basketful, so heavy that she could barely lift it.

“Reward for the host: Permanent Strength Pill.”

A pill appeared in her hand out of nowhere, and without a second thought, she popped it into her mouth.

With a burst of strength, she managed to lift the basket, surprising herself.

“Not enough consumption, not enough!”

Shu Yueke sprinted back, carrying the basket of fish weighing nearly a hundred jin.

“Come with me! There are tons of fish by the river!”

Seeing Shu Yueke in a hurry, Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin immediately dropped their tasks and grabbed baskets.

Wang Rong hadn’t yet processed what was happening when the trio dashed off. She stood there for a moment, unable to find a basket, and finally just grabbed two wooden tubs from the kitchen.

On the way, they encountered villagers who looked at the family rushing toward the river with puzzled expressions. Upon seeing them return, they could no longer contain their curiosity and all started following suit, each grabbing a basket to head to the river, but none caught a single fish.

After Shu Yueke and her family returned, she called out to Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin to head up the mountain again.

Wang Rong stayed home to guard the place.

To avoid raising further suspicion among the villagers, the three of them took a rarely traveled path up the mountain.

Last time, they descended with goods from this route, so Song Qingqing’s mother didn’t realize she had taken so much to their home; otherwise, things would have ended very differently that day.

They made it up the mountain without a hitch, though there was still some obstruction as wild chickens and rabbits occasionally fell in front of them.

Finding a flat spot, the three sat down and watched as various wild chickens and rabbits fell before them in all sorts of bizarre ways. Some injured chickens couldn’t fly, others landed headfirst into the dirt, and some rabbits crashed into trees. Even more ridiculous were the rabbits that suddenly fell asleep right in front of them.

“This is too ridiculous! San Mei, don’t do this again next time; it’s too shocking! Just let her feel what you want and give you the rewards!” Shu Yuqin said, clutching her heart.

“Who knew it would turn out like this? The villagers must be so confused.”

“Let’s just pretend we don’t know anything.”

Shu Yueke nodded; there was no other option.

When a massive wild boar fell right before them, the system rewarded them with three storage bags, and finally, the anxious voice of Mei Mei fell silent.

Each of the three received one storage bag. Under Mei Mei’s guidance, they each dripped blood onto the bags to recognize ownership. Once claimed, the bags shrank into three circles that fit snugly around their wrists.

They packed their things into the storage bags and went back down the mountain, empty baskets in tow.

Having just witnessed the fish leaping into Shu Yueke’s basket, Wang Rong felt hopeful upon seeing the three return.

If luck really was this good, their future days would be splendid.

But to her surprise, the three returned with empty baskets.

“Nothing at all?”

“Nothing. I saw the fish jumping at the river and thought I was lucky, which is why I brought my sisters back with me. Unfortunately, we didn’t catch anything. Guess it was just a fluke.”

“Cough, cough, Wang family.”

Wang Rong couldn’t contain her disappointment and sighed several times when she heard the old village chief’s voice from outside.

“Grandpa Village Chief, what brings you here? And everyone else?”

“The villagers said they saw you all catching a lot of fish in the river and asked this old man to find out how you did it,” the old village chief said, his face slightly flushed.

“Grandpa Village Chief, why should we share our fishing methods with others?”

“We’re all from the same village. You caught so many fish so quickly; the river belongs to everyone. You should share with us,” someone from the village chimed in eagerly.

“Grandpa Village Chief, we didn’t use any special methods. I just happened to walk by and saw the fish gathering near the shore, so I called my family to go fishing together. Even if we did have a method, we wouldn’t share it with the villagers,” Shu Yueke asserted firmly.

Some villagers still thought her family was easy to bully and had no reason to demand anything.

“Look, you really can catch a lot; just let everyone know the river is full of fish. It won’t interfere with your fishing.”

“And we’re all from the same village.”

“You ladies need our support, so let’s help each other.”

The villagers chattered away, and the old village chief felt he shouldn’t have come with such a soft heart.

“Shut up! If they don’t want to share their way of making money, then so be it! Where do you get off talking nonsense? You should share your own ways of making money instead,” he barked, silencing the crowd.

“Everyone’s intentions are clear, but…” Shu Yueke scanned the room and continued.
