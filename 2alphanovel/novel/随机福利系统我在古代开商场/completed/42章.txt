**Buying Land at the End of the Alley**

That evening, Clara Joy took out her ledger and recorded the money she had handed over to Summer Ling earlier that day. Since both Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin had each contributed five thousand taels, she decided to do the same, bringing the total to fifteen thousand taels as their initial capital. Once they started earning, they would share the profits evenly.

As for Shu Qingyan, who had left to pursue some business ventures, Clara planned to allocate some of the funds from their pooled money to support her. Similarly, Shu Yuqin would also draw from this fund for her culinary experiments.

The following day, Clara Joy, accompanied by Shu Xin, set out to find a broker who could help them purchase a suitable plot of land for building a marketplace. After inquiring with numerous locals and seeking the advice of various knowledgeable individuals, Clara learned that there were two main brokers in the county.

One was the Xu Family Brokerage, primarily dealing with the rental of shops and properties. The other was the Gou Family Brokerage, which specialized in buying and selling land and property rights.

In the county, most of the land was owned by wealthy families, and while some of it was available for sale through the brokers, this was quite rare. Generally, the transactions involved the sale of houses and shops.

Clara Joy arrived at the Gou Family Brokerage, and as soon as the clerk spotted her, he approached her eagerly. “Miss, are you looking to buy land or rent a shop?” 

“I want to buy a plot of land to develop myself,” Clara replied confidently.

“Ah, for that, you should speak with Brother Wu, our top salesperson. Let me fetch him for you,” the clerk said, nodding before disappearing into the back.

After a short wait, Brother Wu arrived. Clara couldn’t help but notice his tall stature and the long scar that marred his otherwise jovial face, creating an odd contrast. 

“So, you’re looking to buy land, huh? I happen to have a few parcels available. Why don’t you tell me the size you’re interested in, and I can narrow it down for you?” Brother Wu invited, gesturing for Clara to take a seat while he poured tea for them.

“I’d prefer a larger plot, around two hundred acres,” she stated, her tone firm.

Brother Wu’s eyes widened in surprise. “Are you sure you mean two hundred acres?”

“Absolutely,” Clara affirmed.

“Alright, but if you’re looking for that size, the central area of the county won’t have anything available. You’ll have to look in the outskirts,” he explained, flipping through his records.

“I’m looking for something a bit closer,” Clara insisted.

“Let me see… we have two options,” Brother Wu replied, his finger tracing the listings. “One is just outside the southern alley, still within the county, and the other is a bit farther out, but it’s farmland. If you choose that one, we’ll have to price it as premium farmland.”

“What’s the asking price for the plot at the southern alley?” Clara asked, narrowing her eyes in consideration.

Brother Wu looked her over carefully before responding. “It’s six taels of silver per acre, but I can offer you a bit more width on each acre.”

“From what I know, the southern area is populated mainly by impoverished families. That plot at the alley has been neglected for years; the grass there is probably taller than most people by now. Even if we open a shop, there’s no guarantee we’ll make any profit. Besides, I doubt anyone else would want to buy such a large piece. Are you sure you don’t want to reconsider the price?” 

Brother Wu’s eyes flashed with concern. “Miss, that’s the lowest price we can offer. If you ask around, you’ll find we’re the only brokerage that deals in land sales, especially such large plots. It’s a rare opportunity.”

Clara sensed the underlying message in Brother Wu’s words—he was implying that if she didn’t buy from them, she wouldn’t find any alternative options. 

“If you’re not genuinely interested in selling, then we can end this conversation here,” she said, standing up to leave.

“Wait, Miss! Please sit back down. Let’s talk this over again. Don’t rush out,” Brother Wu urged, clearly flustered.

“What’s there to discuss? You think I’m just going to buy without any consideration? I won’t be taken advantage of,” Clara retorted, her voice tinged with irritation.

Seeing her determination, Brother Wu quickly recalibrated. “How about this—five taels per acre? That’s still a total discount of three hundred taels on the three hundred acres you’re interested in.”

Clara shook her head, turning to walk out, ignoring his attempts to call her back. Did he take her for a fool? Five taels for a piece of neglected land? She knew that at this time, if someone cleared the land, it would belong to them. Back in her village, a nearby piece of overgrown land was sold for just nine taels for over three acres by the old village chief.

“Miss! Are you looking to buy land?” Suddenly, a younger man from inside chased after her.

Clara Joy was not in the mood to deal with anyone from the Gou Family Brokerage anymore. She kept her head down and pulled Shu Xin along, determined to leave.

However, the young man persisted, following closely behind her, provoking Shu Xin to bark out a few growls in frustration. It was only when Clara noticed the increasingly curious stares from passersby that she finally stopped.

After calming Shu Xin with a few drops of spiritual water, she turned to the young man. “If you want to sell to me, what’s the price?”

“I can offer you three taels per acre. That’s the lowest I can go,” he replied earnestly.

Clara remained skeptical. “Aren’t you all from the same brokerage? If he’s charging that much, how can you sell it to me for so little?”

“Yes, we work for the same brokerage, but Brother Wu might have miscalculated the price. I overheard him quoting you high, so I came out to catch you before you left,” the young man explained.

Clara couldn’t help but scoff at his reasoning. Still, the opportunity was too good to pass up, and she was aware that if she didn’t seize this chance, she might miss out on a great deal.

“Fine, I’ll take it,” Clara decided firmly.

“Then please follow me back to the brokerage. I’ll draft the contract, and once you pay, we can finalize the paperwork at the county office,” he instructed, leading her back.

As they re-entered the brokerage, Clara spotted Brother Wu still looking smug. She shot him a glance before following the young man, who introduced himself as Li Cheng.

“What’s your angle, Li Cheng?” Clara asked suspiciously.

“I’m merely facilitating the sale of land that Wu isn’t willing to let go of,” Li Cheng replied casually.

After drafting the contract, they went to the shopkeeper to finalize the signatures. Clara Joy handed over the money, and Li Cheng promptly went to the county office to process the deed.

About half an hour later, Li Cheng returned with the completed land deed, which Clara quickly stored in her pouch. 

“If you ever need work, feel free to look for me,” he offered, his tone friendly.

Clara Joy felt a twinge of concern that this endeavor might lead to Li Cheng facing repercussions from his brokerage for helping her, but she would cross that bridge when they got there. For now, she had secured the land she needed.
