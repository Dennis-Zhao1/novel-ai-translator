**At the Mercy of Others**

“You, what do you mean?” Ning’s voice trembled as she glanced warily at Shu Qingyan, who stood behind Shu Yueke, feeling an unsettling fear creeping in.

“You weren’t willing to marry off your daughter for eight taels of silver, so how about I buy her for nine taels?” Shu Yueke proposed, her tone casual yet laced with a hint of mischief.

Nine taels of silver sent a thrill through Ning’s heart, but she feigned reluctance. 

Shu Yueke could see right through her act. “If you’re not willing, then go ahead and marry her off for eight taels. After all, I’m gaining an extra tael here.”

“Why are you hesitating? We had a deal, and you can’t back out now.” The man who had been called the son-in-law grumbled, clearly displeased.

“Deal? If you offer me an extra tael, I’ll hand over my daughter without a second thought,” Ning snapped, her patience wearing thin. 

The man was momentarily speechless; eight taels was already a stretch for him, and he was deep in debt because of it.

“Did you really mean nine taels to buy her?” he asked, his eyes narrowing.

Shu Yueke nodded firmly, “Absolutely.”

“Alright, bring me the nine taels and I’ll take the girl.” 

“Wait a moment, I’ve called the village head here to write up a contract before we proceed,” Shu Yueke replied, buying some time.

Ning’s eyes flickered with a mix of anxiety and impatience. 

“We’re all from the same village; why don’t you trust me? If I sell her to you, she’ll be yours, and I won’t have any further ties to her.” 

Shu Yueke shot her a skeptical glance, suspicion written all over her face. “I don’t trust you.”

Ning, feeling humiliated, could barely contain her rage. “You…”

“What do you want?” Shu Qingyan interjected coldly, stepping in front of Shu Yueke and glaring at Ning.

Ning instinctively took a step back, fearing that Shu Qingyan might injure her again.

“I—I don’t want anything,” she stammered.

“If you want money, just wait patiently. Once the village head arrives and the contract is signed, you’ll get your payment,” Shu Qingyan ordered.

Moments later, the old village head arrived, accompanied by his son, having been summoned by Li An. They brought along the pre-written contract, which Ning reluctantly signed.

With the contract finally in hand, Shu Yueke brought Song Qingqing before her and handed over the nine taels of silver to Ning. 

Ning’s eyes sparkled with greed, and she clutched the money tightly to her chest. “Let’s go home.”

“For now, you’ll be living with the three of us,” Shu Yueke said to Song Qingqing once they returned home.

“I’m sorry for the trouble. By the way, do you have any paper?” Song Qingqing asked.

“I think we have a few sheets. Do you need them?” 

“I remember Aunt Wang can read and write a bit. I’d like to ask her to help me write an IOU.”

“Oh come on, do we really need an IOU between us? I trust you,” Shu Yueke reassured her, genuinely believing in their friendship.

“I know you trust me, but even brothers should keep accounts clear. Writing an IOU would make me feel better,” Song Qingqing insisted, her seriousness prompting Shu Yueke to relent, feeling comforted by the straightforwardness of their friendship.

So, they called on Wang Rong to help draft the IOU.

“Aunt Wang, could you write that I borrowed nine taels from your family?”

Shu Yueke frowned. “No, no. You’ve only used one tael, so you only owe us eight.”

“I still need to stay with you for a while, and that means rent too,” Song Qingqing countered.

Shu Yueke tried to argue a few more times, but ultimately she couldn’t convince Song Qingqing otherwise.

Afterward, Song Qingqing continued to help Chen Ping and Wang Rong with their weaving while Shu Yueke and Shu Qingyan set up stalls in the county to sell their goods. 

Daily, after subtracting costs, they earned a stable income of about one tael, totaling six to seven hundred wen.

As time flew by, it was now mid-October.

Shu Yueke and Shu Qingyan had returned home to join in the weaving when suddenly there was a commotion outside. 

Wang Rong had just come back from the latrine and noticed everyone busy. “I’ll go check it out.”

Minutes passed, and as they waited, Wang Rong had yet to return.

“I’ll go see what’s taking her so long,” Shu Yueke said, wiping her hands on a cloth.

“Mother! Mother, what’s wrong?” Shu Yueke called out, searching until she found Wang Rong lying next to the thatched house, a piece of paper clutched in her hand.

Panic surged through Shu Yueke as she rushed to her, calling out Wang Rong’s name until she finally opened her eyes, tears brimming instantly upon seeing her daughter.

Without asking what happened, Shu Yueke quickly checked if Wang Rong was hurt. After confirming she was fine, she lifted her and carried her back to the house.

“What happened? What’s going on?” Chen Ping asked, worry etched on her face.

The others, including Shu Qingyan, looked equally concerned.

“I don’t know,” Shu Yueke replied as she settled Wang Rong onto her bed, noticing the paper still in her grasp.

“Mother, is this because of what’s written on that paper?” she asked gently.

Wang Rong nodded, tears spilling over uncontrollably. 

[Do you recognize this pouch? He never cherished it. I am his wife, the daughter of the prime minister. Before you met him, he married me in a grand ceremony. You are merely a fleeting episode in our happy family, or perhaps just a plaything of his. I know you have three children, and I initially planned to spare their lives, but now that you’re thriving, I must regretfully inform you that soon, your children will be taken from you.]

As Shu Yueke finished reading, her fists clenched tightly. 

“Do you realize he deceived you?” she asked urgently.

Wang Rong shook her head in disbelief. 

“He gave Aunt Zhou money, telling me he was heading to the capital to take exams and to wait for him at the Wang family. He promised he would come back for me. I never realized that he had a family already.” 

As she spoke, Wang Rong broke down, her sobs echoing through the room, bringing in the others who were outside.

Hearing Shu Yueke's words, Chen Ping couldn’t hold back any longer. 

“I told you he was lying! Why didn’t you believe me? Look at his demeanor—how could he be the rustic man he claimed to be? And he’s been gone for years! Did you really not suspect anything?” Chen Ping scolded Wang Rong, pulling her into a comforting embrace.

Shu Yueke and the others, worried about Wang Rong’s emotional state, couldn’t shake off the chilling last words from the letter. 

The daughter of a prime minister, with power and wealth, threatening to take their lives. How could they resist?

They were at the mercy of others, completely vulnerable.

“I’m not worried for myself, but for my children. What should we do?” Wang Rong cried out, her voice torn with despair.

“Jojo, maybe you should hide. Get the kids up and leave quickly, go into hiding,” someone suggested.

“Yes, hurry, pack your things and leave,” others urged.

But Shu Yueke and the others shook their heads.

“If she could deliver this letter to you, it means she has people watching us. There’s no escaping this,” Shu Yueke said, her voice serious.

Suddenly, a wave of urgency washed over Shu Yueke. 

“Ping Aunty, you need to leave now! Take Qingqing and go home. We don’t know when they’ll come,” she insisted.

Chen Ping understood the gravity of the situation. They were all defenseless against those who might come, and staying wouldn’t change anything, but leaving felt wrong too; they were stronger together.

“I’ll stay with you.”

“No, you have your brother Shunzi to think about. You can’t gamble with your life like that,” Shu Yueke said firmly, pushing them toward the door.

Chen Ping and Song Qingqing’s eyes filled with tears as they choked out, “Please, be careful!”

“Don’t go looking for help. Those people are skilled fighters; it wouldn’t help,” Shu Yueke warned, her heart racing at the thought of them being harmed.

The wait to be slaughtered felt interminable, and as the time dragged on, darkness finally began to descend.
