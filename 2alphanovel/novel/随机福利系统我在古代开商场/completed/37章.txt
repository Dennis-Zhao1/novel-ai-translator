**The Hypocritical Wang Changyu**

Ever since Zhang Lanlan had taken Clara Joy as her mentor, every day had become an opportunity for Clara to showcase her skills while bringing along her two apprentices. On this particular day, as usual, Clara sold a few items at her stall, but most of the time was spent watching Zhang Lanlan and Yan Xu bicker and play around. Sometimes, Clara felt like she had stepped out of time; after all, a young lady of Zhang Lanlan’s stature should have been confined to the inner quarters of her home.

Perhaps Zhang Lanlan's parents spoiled her too much.

Clara smiled as she observed the two of them, maintaining an indulgent expression, but her gaze shifted and suddenly fell upon Wang Changyu. Behind him were a few young people of similar age, and as they approached her stall, an uneasy feeling crept over her.

Just as she feared, Wang Changyu dropped to his knees right in front of Clara's stall. This sudden act drew the attention of many passersby.

"Who are you, and what are you doing?" Zhang Lanlan asked angrily, clearly irritated that Wang Changyu's kneeling was disrupting Clara's business.

"Please, cousin, spare my grandmother," Wang Changyu pleaded, his voice earnest.

"Please spare my grandma," he repeated, desperation etched across his face.

"She killed someone and was taken by the authorities. Why are you here begging me?" Clara shot back, her tone sharp.

"But Grandma didn’t mean it! She’s your grandmother too. Ever since you three sisters were young, she took you in. I’ve heard that if you don’t pursue this matter, she can be released."

Clara's expression hardened, a layer of frost settling in her eyes. 

"Ask those around us—where have you ever seen a married daughter still living at her mother's house while her grandmother took care of you? If it weren't for her, who knows how you would have fared. In other words, she saved your lives."

"True, Grandma did make mistakes, but she provided for you, gave you shelter. Once you grew up, you all moved out, and she even gave you fifteen taels of silver."

"I think Grandma has done all she could. Your mother is an outside daughter; after marrying, she didn't just stay with her family. When you moved out, Grandma even gave you money to ensure you wouldn’t starve. Just because she made a mistake and accidentally pushed your mother, who then fell and died, you want to sue her? How can you sleep at night?"

Wang Changyu continued to plead, ignoring Clara's clear tone of refusal. 

"Are you done? If you’re finished, you can leave now. I don't want to repeat myself," Clara said, her patience wearing thin as she gazed down at the distraught Wang Changyu.

"Please, I beg you, spare my grandmother," he insisted, lowering his head and knocking it against the ground in desperation.

"Miss, please have mercy on your grandmother," one of the young men who had come with Wang Changyu pleaded, their brows furrowed with concern. "Changyu told us everything, but your grandmother didn’t do it on purpose. She took you in when you were young. She’s old now; please don’t pursue this matter further."

Wang Changyu’s display of weakness prompted several bystanders and Clara’s customers to speak up on his behalf. Some even accused Clara of being heartless, suggesting that she should never have taken them in to begin with.

"Enough!" Clara shouted, cutting through the murmurs of the crowd.

"Wang Changyu, you don’t need to put on this act. I had no intention of revealing everything, considering you haven’t harmed us. But since you’ve chosen to humiliate yourself, I won’t hold back either. Perhaps we should let everyone judge this matter together."

Wang Changyu felt a sense of unease wash over him at Clara's words. He only returned home once a month, and there were many details he didn’t know fully. 

He had planned to leverage the support of the townspeople based on how Zhou Cuihua had taken care of them, and how she had even given them money after they moved out. He believed that this would force Clara into a corner. The last time he had brought up using money to save Zhou Cuihua, his father had refused, insisting that the money was to be saved for his education, but without Zhou Cuihua's release, he couldn’t pursue that path.

"When we moved into your house, it was because my father left a considerable amount of silver with your grandmother. That money was more than enough for us to live on and could have afforded you all a comfortable life."

"But when we lived there, how did your grandmother treat us? For over a decade, we never had a full meal. We lived in a makeshift shack next to the pigpen. When it rained, we were soaked, and we were made to work from dawn until dusk."

"Later, your grandmother sold all the jewelry my father had given my mother. My mother thought that would lead to better treatment from her, but that didn’t happen."

"We were so hungry that we foraged in the mountains for food, only to eat poisonous mushrooms and nearly died."

"Yet your grandmother never took us to the doctor. Instead, she wanted us to marry off to someone else, even considering ghost marriages. Thankfully, we woke up just in time, or the situation would have been dire."

"We thought your grandmother believed we were dead, but even when we stood right in front of her, she had the audacity to drug us and wanted us to marry dead men. What does that even mean? It meant we would be buried alive!"

As Clara spoke, tears streamed down her cheeks, and her petite frame seemed even more fragile. She sniffed occasionally, her voice thick with emotion, as though a torrent of grievances had been unleashed.

"When we decided to move out, your grandparents were worried we would expose them, so they agreed to give us fifteen taels of silver, but that amount was only a fraction of what my father had given them."

"We accepted it, my mother took us out, and even if we lived in a thatched hut, as long as we were together, that was enough. But your grandmother didn’t let go. When my mother fell ill, taking advantage of the fact that only my second sister was home, she caused trouble for my mother and even tried to hit her. My mother pushed back to protect my sister, but your grandmother shoved her hard, causing her to fall and die. She knew my mother was weak; how could she use so much force? If that wasn’t intentional, then why did my mother have to die?"

"Tell me, do you think you can compensate for my mother’s death?"

"You say I’m suing your grandmother, but I didn’t even believe it was her at first. I came home to find my mother lying on the ground, blood pooling everywhere. I was about to call the villagers for help when I discovered it was indeed your grandmother. By then, the officials had already arrived. It was because of your grandmother’s crime that we, as vulnerable women, had to face the law. How could we possibly let her go?"

With Clara’s heart-wrenching testimony, she managed to rally the crowd around her side, creating a sense of unity against Wang Changyu. Her two apprentices were equally moved—one was crying harder than Clara, while the other shot daggers at Wang Changyu with red-rimmed eyes.

"As long as you don’t pursue this, everything will be fine," Wang Changyu insisted, desperation etched across his face.

"How could we possibly do that? Your grandmother committed a crime, and the authorities have investigated. If we say we won't pursue it, wouldn’t that be mocking the officials? Please, cousin, understand our plight. We sisters only have each other now and cannot afford to anger the authorities."

"Didn’t you earn some money? Just give the officials a little extra, and perhaps your grandmother can be released."
