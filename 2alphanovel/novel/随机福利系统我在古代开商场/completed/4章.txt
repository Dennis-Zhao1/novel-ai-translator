**Different Thoughts**

"Mother Jia, I know that the Jia family is known for their kindness, but this is what our family wants. If you're worried about any bad rumors, we can settle this privately, without anyone finding out," Zhou Cuihua whispered.

Mother Jia looked deeply at Zhou Cuihua, completely taken aback by the ruthlessness displayed by this woman—those children were her own granddaughters.

"I can't make this decision alone; I must consult with the old lady back home first," she replied.

Zhou Cuihua wore a beaming smile, showing no signs of doubt that this would go through. Given how much the elder Mrs. He favored her grandson, He San, this matter was practically a done deal.

"Then you should go back and ask the old lady. I'll be waiting for your news at home. However, since these are living people, shouldn't we raise the price a bit?" she suggested slyly.

Mother Jia scoffed, "Why are you in such a hurry? Nothing has been decided yet!"

"Alright, alright, I won't take up more of your time," Zhou Cuihua said, bowing her head in deference.

As she watched Mother Jia leave, Zhou Cuihua's smile vanished in an instant. "Pah! She really thinks she’s something special, just a dog of the Jia family, nothing more."

"Mother, how did it go? Did it work out?" Zhou Shi asked eagerly as soon as Zhou Cuihua returned home.

Zhou Cuihua looked at her second daughter-in-law, who was also her niece from her maternal side, and her expression darkened as she recalled what Clara Joy had said. However, remembering the good advice Clara had given her, she refrained from lashing out.

"We're just waiting for news, but I think it's already settled. The money from your side should come in to make up for the last mistake."

"Ah, I was ready for that long ago! Last time, my mother and the others needed it urgently, and they paid me back. But I thought I'd wait until I had enough to give you a round sum. Here, I have a couple of silver taels—this is from the wages of my second son and some embroidery work I did, already turned into silver for you. It’ll be easier for you to manage," Zhou Shi sweetly said, though her heart was bleeding inside.

Zhou Cuihua quickly took the money from Zhou Shi's hands and put it into her own purse. "It's getting cold; I can buy a few more outfits for my eldest grandson."

At that moment, her expression darkened again as her gaze swept around the room, finally landing on Tang Shi, who was huddled in the corner.

"Mother," Tang Shi spoke weakly.

"Don't call me mother; I can't afford that title. If it weren't for you being my eldest grandson's mother, I would have had my eldest son divorce you already."

"Mother, please don't! I've made a mistake; I won't do it again!" Tang Shi trembled as she stepped forward.

Before long, the sounds of Tang Shi's cries and Zhou Cuihua's heavy breathing as she swung a broom echoed through the house.

"Oh, my savior has returned!" Clara Joy said from her hiding spot, peeking through the window.

"Grandmother, did my mother mess up again? Please don’t hold it against her; it will upset your health, and Yu'er will be heartbroken. Look, today my classmate recommended a silver shop to me, and I specially bought you a bracelet!" Wang Changyu said, frowning as he strode over to Zhou Cuihua.

Zhou Cuihua quickly dropped the broom and took the bracelet. "My eldest grandson is back! Oh, you still remember your grandmother. This bracelet is beautiful; it must have cost you quite a bit. Save your money for yourself; nothing makes me happier than seeing you well-off."

Zhou Cuihua's eyes glistened with gratitude. "My Yu'er is so filial."

"Tang Shi, just look at yourself, you disgraceful mother! All you do is embarrass Yu'er every day."

"Grandmother, I'll talk to my mother later; please don’t worry about her. Come, let's go inside; I want to tell you about my academy," Wang Changyu said, suppressing the annoyance in his voice.

Zhou Cuihua, charmed by Wang Changyu, had lost all her anger and followed him down the steps.

"Tang Shi, since Yu'er is back, why don't you go buy some meat from the butcher, Lu?"

"Yu'er certainly has a lot of pocket money, to even buy a bracelet for you, Grandmother," Zhou Shi said, staring at the bracelet.

"Second Aunt misunderstands. The bracelet for Grandmother was bought with my savings; I skipped many gatherings with classmates, which made them distant. But for Grandmother's happiness, it's worth it," Wang Changyu maintained his warm smile.

"My good grandson, you can't do that! It's important to maintain good relationships with your classmates; it will help you later. Next time, I'll give you more silver so you can treat your classmates to meals more often."

Wang Changyu nodded, "Okay, I will listen to Grandmother."

Zhou Shi watched the two leave, jealousy bubbling up inside her.

"Second Aunt, how does it feel to be sewing clothes for others? No matter how hard you work for your money, Grandmother only spends it on my cousin. Ah, it seems that Second Aunt will never bear a son. I bet all the money in this house will go to my cousin in the future," Clara Joy said, dashing off to avoid Zhou Shi's wrath.

Zhou Shi felt a knot of anger stuck in her chest, unable to release. Turning, she saw someone at the door and could no longer contain herself.

"It's all your fault, you two shameless women, for taking up my womb and preventing me from having a son!"

Wang Sinan tightly held his younger sister Wang Zhaodi's hand, unsure of what their mother was upset about now.

"Go inside."

The six-year-old Wang Zhaodi shivered; every time their mother sent them back inside, they would be beaten. But if they didn’t go, the punishment at night would be even worse.

"Are you going to move or not?"

"I'm taking my sister inside right now," Wang Sinan said, tears brimming in her eyes.

"What a hypocritical woman! Acting gentle outside but beating her own children at home. These two sisters are definitely not living well," Shu Yuqin said, filled with sympathy.

"Did my third sister do that on purpose?" Shu Qingyan asked, though it was more of a statement than a question.

Wang Rong's curiosity was piqued by this remark, and she looked inquisitively at Clara Joy.

"How could that be? I just said it casually to annoy Second Aunt," Clara Joy quickly shook her head, shooting a glare at Shu Qingyan.

Shu Qingyan realized Wang Rong was still there and awkwardly cleared her throat.

Wang Rong finally breathed a sigh of relief; she was worried this incident would change the children's personalities, but thankfully, it seemed alright.

However, Shu Yuqin and Shu Qingyan had made up their minds. Behind Wang Rong's back, they both gave Clara Joy a thumbs-up.

Although Wang Sinan and her sister were pitiful, that hardship didn’t make them kind-hearted. Instead, it twisted their personalities. When the original sisters were still around, they had often been bullied by the two, for in this household, they were always held in higher regard.

Later that evening, in Zhou Cuihua's room.

"Why are we keeping these three kids alive? Are we just going to let them stay here and eat for free? And you even gave them eggs for dinner tonight," Wang Yuanyi, the head of the Wang family, asked impatiently.

"Don't be so anxious, old man. The He family raised the price to a hundred taels and sent word that we need to find a way to send these three children over tomorrow night."

"A hundred taels? They’d never get that price elsewhere. We've raised them for over ten years; they owe us for the years they’ve lived. Did you agree to it?"

"Of course, I was the one who insisted they raise the price. How about that? I did well this time, didn’t I?"

"Mm."

Soon after, the room was filled with the sounds of shy moans...
