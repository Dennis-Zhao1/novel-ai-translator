**Achieving the Objective**

“First of all, my father left behind a sum of money when he passed. That money should be enough for my sisters and me to live on, perhaps even longer,” Ethan Jade stated firmly.

“Secondly, all the jewelry my father bought for my mother was sold off by you. Even if we count it conservatively, there were at least thirty taels of silver—enough to sustain an ordinary family for a decade.”

“Thirdly, since we came here, we’ve worked ourselves to the bone, rising before the roosters and going to bed after the dogs; we’ve been beaten and scolded, and it’s common for us to go hungry.”

Ethan noticed the furrow in Wang Yuanyi's brow deepening and paused for a moment before continuing, “When you add it all up, it seems like you and grandfather have taken quite a hefty advantage of us.”

“Bah! What advantage have we taken?” Zhou Cuihua scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. “Wang Rong, can you just sit there and watch your daughter slander your own parents? Oh, I really regret giving birth to you!” she exclaimed, her eyes darting toward Wang Rong as if seeking some form of support.

Wang Rong, supported by Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin, sensed her daughter's worry and gently patted her hand. “Mother, if you want to make a scene, go ahead. You know in your heart whether what San Ni said is true, and it would be just right for the respected elders in the village to come and judge.”

Seeing Wang Rong’s resolve, Ethan felt more assured and decided not to waste any more breath. “We want to move out, and you need to give us ten taels of silver. After that, we’ll be two separate families.”

“No way! Ten taels of silver? Why don’t you go rob someone? And besides, if you move out, who’s going to do the work around here?” Zhou Cuihua exploded, her face flushed with anger.

“If not, we’ll invite everyone to hear the truth. Not to mention the money my father left behind, just the fact that you sold us off to the Jia family—if that gets out, even if you deny it, the villagers will spread it. Don’t you think the Jia family will blame you for ruining their reputation?” Ethan challenged, her voice steady.

“How dare you!” Zhou Cuihua shouted, pointing an accusatory finger at Ethan.

Wang Yuanyi’s face darkened further, silence enveloping him as he contemplated the situation.

Ethan decided it was time to unleash her trump card. “What if this leads to the Jia family retaliating and ruining my cousin’s schooling, or even…”

“You move out, and I’ll give you fifteen taels. Just get out of here right now, and we’ll sever all ties!” Wang Yuanyi finally snapped, his voice cold and commanding.

Sever ties? Ethan couldn’t help but relish the thought. She feared these people would come back later, using their past kindness as leverage to entangle them further.

“Alright, just to prevent any troubles in the future if we run out of money and come back begging, Grandfather, don’t you think we should have the village head come over to draft a written agreement?” Ethan suggested with a seemingly innocent expression.

Wang Yuanyi eyed Ethan suspiciously, her demeanor strikingly different from before, but he still doubted whether a single woman could survive with three young girls, even with the silver he provided.

“Eldest, go fetch the village head,” he ordered.

“Father, what will they do for a living if the youngest sisters leave?” Wang He interjected, concerned.

“Eldest brother, they’re the ones insisting on leaving; I didn’t force them out,” Wang Rong replied, clarity in her tone.

“San Ni, quickly tell your grandfather that you were just joking before! Little sister, you too—how could you let San Ni say such things?” Wang He looked between Ethan and Wang Rong, disapproval written all over his face.

In her memories, Ethan recalled that among the elders, her uncle had been decent, but unfortunately, he was under his wife’s thumb.

Seeing her husband’s sour expression, Tang Shi tugged at his sleeve urgently. “Just go, stop wasting time.”

“Eldest brother, please go find the village head. It’s our decision to leave,” Wang Rong insisted.

With no other choice, Wang He reluctantly complied.

Before long, the village head was summoned. Wang Yuanyi, without saying much, simply stated that the sisters were to move out, offering them fifteen taels of silver, and that they would have no further ties.

“Grandfather, why not add a clause about severing ties with my mother? After all, regardless of how we separate, she’s still your daughter. If it comes down to a crisis, you must help her, right?” Ethan pressed.

“Add it. You can’t expect to eat off my table again. Don’t ever set foot in my house again!” Zhou Cuihua interjected angrily.

Wang Rong opened her mouth, ready to argue against that clause, but Zhou Cuihua’s words drowned her out.

“Then let’s have the village head add that clause,” Ethan said.

Wang Rong felt her heart sink, tears trembling on the brink of falling.

Ethan quickly glanced at Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin, who tightened their grips, understanding her intention. If Wang Rong fell to the ground crying, it would be such an embarrassment and a blow to their morale.

The old village head disapproved; he knew how difficult it must be for a woman to raise three young girls alone. But seeing that both sides agreed, he felt powerless to intervene.

After the relevant agreement was established, Wang Yuanyi directed Zhou Cuihua to hand over the fifteen taels of silver to Wang Rong.

“Now, just get out of my sight. It’s as if I never had you as my daughter,” he said coldly.

Following the village head, Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin practically supported Wang Rong as they stepped out. Once outside, the village head paused and looked at them with sympathy.

“Village head, please don’t think we’re pitiful. We’re so happy to leave this house; at least we don’t have to worry about being drugged and sold off,” Shu Yuqin said cheerfully.

The old village head grasped the meaning behind her words, finally understanding why they were so eager to leave the Wang family.

As Ethan patted Shu Yuqin, the village head said gently, “Don’t worry; I won’t say a word.”

“Where will you stay now?” the village head asked next.

Ethan was suddenly at a loss for words; oh no, she had completely overlooked that detail. She had assumed Wang Yuanyi would take his time returning, and that Zhou Cuihua wouldn’t be able to make such a quick decision to kick them out.

“Village head, I remember there’s a thatched cottage at the end of the village. Could we rent it for a while?” Shu Qingyan suddenly suggested.

The old village head slapped his forehead. “Right! How could I forget about that abandoned house? No need to rent; I’ll let you stay there for free for two months. Although it belongs to the village, everyone around here is family, and I’m sure they’ll be more than willing to help. But we can’t let you stay for free forever.”

Ethan felt relieved; she understood the reasoning behind only offering them two months of free rent. After all, everyone needed to purchase land to build houses. If they paid rent, it would be used for the village’s expenses, and if they overstayed without paying, the villagers would certainly have complaints.

“We don’t want to stay for free; we’ll pay rent,” Shu Qingyan insisted.

Ethan nodded in agreement, wanting to avoid any potential troubles.

“If you insist, then pay what you owe,” the village head replied.

“Can you let my mother go over to rest while we head to town to buy supplies? We’ll come back in the afternoon to sign the contract with you,” Ethan suggested, mainly concerned that the village head wouldn’t have any small change on hand.

They truly needed to go to town to buy essentials since Zhou Cuihua didn’t allow them to take anything with them.

They were genuinely leaving with nothing!
