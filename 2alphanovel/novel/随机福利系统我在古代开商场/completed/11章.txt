**Money Flows Like Water**

Clara Joy, Ethan Jade, and the others helped Wang Rong walk toward the thatched cottage, and from a distance, doubts about life began to creep in.

The thatched cottage was at the edge of the village, seldom frequented by anyone, leaving the surrounding area desolate and overgrown with weeds that towered higher than a person. The cottage was in such a state of disrepair that it looked like it could collapse at any moment. Some of the grass on the roof had disappeared, and inside, one could probably see the sky.

"This place doesn’t seem too bad, right?" Clara Joy attempted to comfort herself.

"You're just fooling yourself," Ethan Jade immediately shot her down.

"Okay, okay," Clara Joy shrugged. "Looks like we've got our work cut out for us today."

Leading the way, Clara Joy stepped on the overgrown grass to clear a path for the disoriented Wang Rong.

Once inside the cottage, it was empty—there wasn’t even a place to sit. Well, there was some grass growing, at least.

"It's all your fault, Mother. You’ve let us down," Wang Rong sobbed, her face filled with regret.

"Mom, please don’t think like that. Leaving Grandma’s house, we don’t feel wronged at all. This is great! Just the four of us living our own lives, without having to serve anyone else. The difficulties we face now are only temporary. We will make sure you live well in the future, so please don’t feel sad," Clara Joy couldn’t bear to see Wang Rong in such a state, and spoke up to comfort her.

"Exactly, Mom! Just try to be a little happier; otherwise, it makes me feel bad," Shu Yuqin chimed in, shaking Wang Rong’s arm gently.

"You need to pull yourself together. If you don't, we really won’t have anywhere to sleep tonight," Ethan Jade said, lacking the knack for sentimental words.

Wang Rong could keenly sense the change in her eldest daughter’s attitude toward her.

"Big Sis, are you blaming me for not bringing you out sooner?" Wang Rong couldn’t help but ask.

"No, you’re overthinking it. We’ve only got this afternoon; let’s just focus on getting things organized."

Wang Rong sighed, wiping away her tears, gazing at Ethan Jade with a pleading look, hoping she wouldn’t blame her.

Seeing this, Clara Joy was ready to step in and speak up. After all, in her past life, Ethan Jade had grown up in a wealthy and warm family, and her feelings for her previous parents ran deep. Given her personality, she might not say anything soft-hearted.

In Clara Joy's eyes, it was already a big deal that Ethan Jade was willing to stay in the thatched cottage; she might just be feeling frustrated inside!

As expected, Ethan Jade remained silent and moved to the side to start pulling weeds.

"Mom, Big Sis has probably been too tired these past few days. She wouldn’t blame you; we all know you are doing this for our sake."

"Oh dear, this place is uninhabitable!" A figure appeared at the door.

"Aunt Ping!" Clara Joy called out, with Shu Yuqin following closely behind.

Seeing Chen Ping arrive, Wang Rong decided not to dwell on her feelings and resolved to make it up to her children in the future.

"Ping Ping, what brings you here?"

Chen Ping tossed down a few sickles she had been holding, "If I don’t come, how will you manage to get things organized this evening? You don’t have any tools!"

"Come on, let’s work together. We need to get as much done as possible. Don’t just sit there feeling sorry for yourself. You should have moved out sooner; this is much better. Don’t let it affect the kids!"

Hearing Chen Ping's words, Ethan Jade raised an eyebrow; she found this woman more to her liking than Wang Rong.

"And I sent your husband to borrow an ox cart from the village chief. He should be back soon. Whoever is at home needs to go to town to buy things; he’ll take them with him," Chen Ping continued, cutting grass as she spoke.

Wang Rong thought it over. She definitely couldn’t go, and given the recent events, Clara Joy was the most suitable choice.

"Let the third girl go with him."

No sooner had she spoken than sounds came from outside.

Clara Joy, clutching all their belongings, climbed onto the ox cart with Chen Ping's husband, Li An, to head to town.

"Third girl, what do you plan to buy?"

"We have nothing at home—tools, pots and pans, rice, flour, oil, and clothes. We need to buy all of it."

Li An nodded, understanding, and planned the route. 

Their first stop was the blacksmith's, where Clara Joy purchased two pots, a spatula, a sickle, a kitchen knife, and two iron basins.

Next, they headed to the general store to buy bowls, ceramic pots, ladles, and wooden buckets.

Then, they went to the clothing shop, where Clara Joy bought eight sets of coarse cloth clothing and some ready-made quilts. Finally, they visited the grain shop, where she bought thirty pounds each of the cheapest black flour and broken rice, along with various essential seasonings.

Watching the coins flow out of her hands, Clara Joy felt like her heart was bleeding.

Noticing that Clara Joy didn’t buy any cooking oil, Li An nodded in approval; the third girl was quite thrifty.

He pulled Clara Joy over to the butcher's shop, where she bought two pieces of lard. At that time, cooking oil was exceedingly expensive, so lard was a better deal, plus they could eat the cracklings.

Thinking about the cracklings made Clara Joy swallow hard; she hadn’t had them since she was a child in her past life, and the delicious flavor was still fresh in her memory...

"Third girl, let’s settle the bill and be on our way," Li An urged as the butcher finished weighing the lard, but Clara Joy was still distracted, looking around.

He had planned to make a table and a few stools for Clara Joy's family later that afternoon!

"Uncle Li, wait a moment. Please add two pounds of pork belly for me."

Li An hesitated at first, but remembering that they had just moved out, he thought it wouldn’t hurt for them to have a good first meal. However, he felt that for just four women, two pounds of meat seemed excessive.

"Third girl, meat is expensive. For your family, half a pound would be just right."

"Not enough. You’re also having dinner at our place tonight," Clara Joy replied with a cheerful smile.

"You’ve just moved out; life is tough. We wouldn’t want to impose on you," Li An said earnestly.

Clara Joy immediately pouted, looking quite unhappy. "How could we not feed those who help us? Uncle Li, do you think our place is too shabby?"

Li An quickly denied it.

"If you don’t join us for dinner, then when you get back, you won’t need to help us anymore."

Li An, a straightforward farmer, couldn’t argue with Clara Joy and quickly gave in.

After the butcher finished weighing the meat, he noticed Clara Joy’s eyes were fixed on a bucket of pig’s feet nearby.

"Young lady, are you interested in pig's feet?"

Clara Joy nodded eagerly, her big eyes blinking innocently.

Her demeanor melted the butcher’s heart, a burly man who couldn’t help but feel soft.

"Since you want it, I’ll do you a favor and give you this pig’s foot for free."

Clara Joy was overjoyed and hurriedly thanked him, "Thank you, Uncle! You’re such a kind person."

Li An couldn’t help but admire how easily Clara Joy managed to get a free pig's foot. Though it might not be worth much, on ordinary days, some farmers would buy one just to satisfy their cravings, which still cost about five coins!

Later, Clara Joy also begged Li An to take her to buy some vegetables, but this time he refused, insisting he had some at home and would bring her some later.

On the way back, Clara Joy counted her spending. Wow, she had just spent over five taels of silver! Most of that was on iron, as she had opted for sturdy pots, which meant the blacksmith's shop had cost her over three taels!
