**Clearing the Thieves' Den**

Seeing the scene unfold before her, Clara Joy was seething with anger. The girl being attacked was none other than Miss Zhang, a regular customer at her family's shop.

Without a second thought, Clara leaped down, her whip cracking like thunder as she knocked two men to the ground. Seizing the moment, she quickly adjusted Miss Zhang's clothing, and as the remaining two men launched their attack, Clara deftly dodged and countered with a kick, sending one sprawling.

"Water's getting away, water's getting away!" A commotion erupted outside, confirming that Clara's sister, Ethan Jade, was causing a distraction.

With swift precision, Clara knocked out the last two men and grabbed Miss Zhang by the arm, leading her to escape through a nearby window. They needed to find a way out before the chaos ended and the men regrouped.

However, with Miss Zhang in tow, Clara couldn't move as fast as she wished. 

"I'll hide somewhere, you go on ahead," Miss Zhang insisted, assessing their dire situation.

Clara hesitated, weighing her options, then dragged Miss Zhang up into a thick tree. "You stay here and keep quiet. I’ll come back for you once I find help," she urged, her tone urgent.

Just as Clara was about to leap down, Miss Zhang grabbed the hem of her shirt. "When you get to the county office, tell them I’m here too. My name is Zhang Lanlan."

Clara barely had time to process the significance of her words before she took off.

The area was a mountain not far from the county town. Clara utilized her light-footed skills to reach the city outskirts, then made her way inward. As she rushed past a horse-drawn carriage, she failed to notice the figure lounging inside.

"Master, it's the girl who saved you last time," murmured one of the men.

The master remained indifferent, barely lifting an eyelid, merely grunting in response.

Upon reaching the county office, Clara was at a loss for how to get someone's attention. Spotting a drum nearby, she wasted no time and began to pound on it.

The resounding beats echoed loudly, drawing the attention of passersby who stopped to witness the spectacle. But Clara found herself waiting impatiently, with no sign of the officials emerging.

What she didn’t know was that the county magistrate had dispatched all his men to search for missing girls, and he himself was in a state of anxiety, ignoring the drum’s call.

Furrowing her brow, Clara realized she couldn’t afford to wait any longer. She charged through the front door and saw only two people inside—one anxiously wringing his hands while the other tried to calm him.

"What are you doing?" Clara half-kneeled on the floor.

“My lady, there’s a group of beggars in the woods outside the county. They’ve captured many girls. Please, we need to send people to rescue them,” she implored urgently.

Upon hearing this, the magistrate sprang up from his seat. "Is what you say true?"

"Absolutely! I was taken there and only managed to escape thanks to the help of my sisters," Clara asserted, noticing the magistrate's hesitation.

"There’s a girl named Zhang Lanlan; she insisted I tell you she’s been captured too."

"Lanlan?" The magistrate's expression darkened. "Gather everyone. Follow this girl and let’s bring them back."

"Yes, sir!" they replied, and while waiting, the magistrate appeared even more anxious than Clara.

"What’s happening with Lanlan now?" he asked.

"She’s fine," Clara reassured him, not wanting to disclose the attempted assault she had suffered. A woman’s reputation was everything.

After a tense wait, Clara finally saw the officials returning, one after another, with captured girls in tow. The magistrate seemed slightly embarrassed as he turned to Clara. "At first, we didn't know where Lanlan was taken, so I sent everyone out to search."

Clara nodded, realizing the magistrate cared deeply for Zhang Lanlan, indicating a close relationship.

With a few teams of men, Clara hurried towards the location of the captives, while the magistrate lagged behind. When they arrived, Clara didn’t concern herself with how the officials handled the situation; she only wanted to find her sisters.

Bursting into the holding area, Clara felt a wave of panic when she saw no one inside. Heart racing, she asked the other girls, who told her that after her and her sisters had left, they hadn’t returned. Clara felt as if her heart had dropped into her stomach.

She kicked open every door, finding nothing but emptiness. As the officials captured the remaining beggars and released the girls, her anxiety only grew. 

Finally, she confronted the leader of the beggars, delivering a swift kick to him. "Where are the other two girls?"

The beggar leader glared at Clara with malice. "My brothers took care of them. They’re dead and thrown in the woods."

The words struck her like lightning. Even if her sisters were stronger than these men, could they truly withstand overwhelming numbers?

Clara’s eyes turned red with rage. She pummeled the beggar leader with her fists and aimed a kick at his groin.

"Sister!"

Clara stopped in her tracks, spinning around to see her sisters, and rushed over to embrace them tightly, tears streaming down her face. 

"Where have you been?"

"We went up the mountain after lighting the fire, thinking you’d be back by now," Ethan Jade explained.

"Next time, we stick together. No more splitting up."

"Are you crazy? There won't be a next time," Ethan said gently, smoothing Clara's disheveled hair.

As the officials escorted the captured men away, the magistrate finally caught up with them. "Where's Lanlan? Where is my daughter?"

Clara led the magistrate to the tree where Zhang Lanlan had hidden, helping her down from her perch.

“Father!” Zhang Lanlan threw herself into the magistrate's arms.

Seeing the heartfelt reunion, Clara and her sisters quietly slipped away. They had done their part, and now it was time to let the adults handle the aftermath.

As dusk approached, Clara, Ethan, and their sister decided against returning to their mountain hideout. Instead, they found an inn in the county, planning to search for a more permanent residence the next day.

Once they left, three men emerged from a concealed spot. The most elegantly dressed among them squinted in the direction the girls had gone, a calculating glint in his eyes.

That night passed without incident, and the three sisters woke up early. Unable to practice running, they resorted to squatting in their room to maintain their strength.

"Where have you been? Do you know I’ve been looking for you for ages?" Clara encountered the frowning Yan Xu while searching for a new place.

"Did you really take me in just to abandon me?" he asked, a hint of disappointment in his voice.

Clara paused, realizing she had indeed forgotten about him. 

"Good disciple, what brings you here?" she coughed lightly, placing her hands behind her back.

"Grandfather sent me to deliver new year’s gifts, but now it’s already February."

"I don’t care about that; let’s just forget it for this year!"

"Grandfather said I should stick by your side every day. I've finally found you; you have to take me with you."

Clara considered this. Since she had promised Elder Yan, she should indeed take Yan Xu with her. Plus, having an extra pair of hands wouldn’t hurt, especially for running errands.

In the end, with Yan Xu's help, Clara and her sisters found a satisfactory house that was ready for them to move into. Although the location wasn’t the best, it would do, costing Clara a total of 280 taels of silver.
