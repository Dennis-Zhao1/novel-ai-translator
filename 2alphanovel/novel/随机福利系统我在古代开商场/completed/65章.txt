**Cause and Effect**

“Island Master, we’re here to buy some fruits. Don’t you want to help your islanders become prosperous?” Clara Joy stood her ground, unwavering.

“I don’t know what misunderstandings you have about those of us from the mainland,” the Island Master replied coolly. “What I do know is that as an island leader, you haven’t done your job. With the unique climate we have here, the islanders could be living well, but because of some biases, everyone’s life is only getting harder.” Clara Joy spoke with sharp conviction.

“Stop talking. Just leave,” a girl standing nearby glanced nervously at the Island Master after hearing Clara Joy’s words.

“We’re not leaving. We can’t just walk away without any explanation,” Clara Joy insisted.

“You’re here to buy fruits, right? Can you pay us first? If you can settle the payment, I’ll talk to you,” the Island Master said with a dismissive tone.

“That doesn’t make sense. I can pay a deposit or half the amount,” Clara Joy countered.

“Then it’s a no-go.”

“If you don’t trust me, how about trusting the Chen family trading company in town?” Clara Joy suggested, trying to find common ground.

“You know someone from the Chen family trading company?” the Island Master raised an eyebrow.

“We know the manager, Young Master Chen. We have a contract with him and are collaborating,” she explained.

The Island Master tapped his fingers rhythmically against the table, contemplating.

“If you don’t trust us, we can have the Chen family handle the fruit collection. We’ll only liaise with them,” Clara Joy added, her mind racing with ideas. The locals held a favorable view of Young Master Chen, and this could work to their advantage. While the islanders couldn’t deliver the goods themselves, it would allow the Chen family to profit from the price difference, delivering the fruits along with seafood.

“I don’t trust you, but I suppose I can talk to the Chen family,” the Island Master conceded.

“Great! I’ll return to discuss this with Young Master Chen and then come back with him,” Clara Joy replied, relieved.

“A-Xue, find A-Wu to take them back by boat,” the Island Master instructed.

Clara Joy let out a sigh of relief. She had feared that the three of them wouldn’t be able to return, especially since the Island Master had seemed hostile towards them.

“Thank you, Island Master.”

“Follow me; I’ll lead you.”

As Clara Joy trailed behind the girl named A-Xue, she couldn’t help but ask, “Miss, may I know why you all dislike us mainland folks so much?”

“Since you know Young Master Chen, you can't be all bad,” A-Xue replied tentatively.

“We’re definitely not bad people!” Clara Joy assured her.

“It’s because the Island Master’s daughter was deceived by someone from the mainland. She insisted on marrying him, disregarding her father’s objections, and chose to sever ties with him. Since then, she never came back. There are rumors that she died,” A-Xue shared, her voice low.

“My mother said that on that night, the Island Master grew a head of white hair from worrying,” she added.

Clara Joy understood now; it was a tragic family story. While the Island Master had his reasons, they didn’t justify his blanket disdain for all mainlanders, causing suffering for everyone on the island. It felt deeply irresponsible to Clara Joy.

“But that’s just a family matter. Don’t you think it’s unfair to generalize your hatred towards all of us because of it?” Clara Joy pressed.

“Of course not! The Island Master is just and his words are always right,” A-Xue defended.

“But there are many people on the mainland. You can’t judge everyone based on one person’s actions. That’s not right. Like us, we would never deceive anyone, or else the Chen family wouldn’t work with us,” Clara Joy argued, noticing A-Xue’s expression falter, as if she was contemplating her words.

“Fine, enough talk. Just hurry up,” A-Xue urged, as they approached the dock town.

Once back, Clara Joy went to the Chen family trading company to discuss the fruits with Young Master Chen. The plan was simple: the trading company would source fruits from Kuoping Island, sell them to Clara Joy, and add a transportation fee, making a profit from the markup.

Calculating it out, each fruit would be priced about seven to eight coins higher. But the fruits from Kuoping Island were unique—mangoes, pineapples, longans, lychees, and jackfruits—not found in Cheng’an County or surrounding areas.

Clara Joy planned to sell a small portion of these in supermarkets, cut into pieces for ordinary families, while most would go to a high-end fruit shop catering to wealthy clientele.

After finalizing the deal, Clara Joy returned to Kuoping Island the next day with Young Master Chen.

Thanks to Young Master Chen’s presence, many locals greeted them warmly. The Island Master even came out to welcome them.

“How have you been, Island Master?” Young Master Chen inquired politely.

“Under your care, we’re managing,” the Island Master replied.

“Today, I bring good news that could change the lives of all islanders,” Young Master Chen announced confidently.

The Island Master noticed Clara Joy’s presence and understood what Young Master Chen was implying.

“We only wish to cooperate with Young Master Chen; let’s not discuss matters with others,” the Island Master stated firmly.

“Don’t worry; they’re the best of people,” Young Master Chen reassured.

“While I trust you, Young Master Chen, I remain cautious about those from the mainland. So, let’s stick to discussing it with you,” the Island Master insisted.

Young Master Chen chuckled, scratching his nose. “Miss Clara has already finalized the details with me. From now on, all the island’s fruits will be purchased through my trading company. That should put your mind at ease.”

“Th-That’s acceptable,” the Island Master stammered, surprised at how quickly Clara Joy had made arrangements with the Chen family trading company.

“Please notify me when the fruits are nearly ripe so I can send people to collect them. It’s best if they’re picked just before they fully ripen since transportation takes a while,” Clara Joy requested.

“From here to Cheng’an County takes about eleven to twelve days. Even if we pick them early, they may be overripe by the time they arrive,” the Island Master replied.

“That won’t be a problem. We’ve arranged to have two teams working day and night to ensure they arrive fresh. You don’t have to worry about spoilage,” Clara Joy assured him confidently.

“I understand your biases against those from the mainland, but I want you to know that not everyone is a fraud. Most people are sincere. Regarding your daughter, she might not be gone; perhaps she’s living a good life far away!” Clara Joy suggested, trying to offer a glimmer of hope.

“Don’t mention her. She’s a disloyal daughter,” the Island Master snapped suddenly, slamming a ceramic cup off the table in anger.

“Do you really not care about your daughter?” Clara Joy pressed.

“I don’t care; I don’t want to hear about her,” he retorted.

“If you don’t care about her, why let her actions influence your feelings towards everyone from the mainland? It seems you can’t accept her departure,” Clara Joy pointed out.

The Island Master fell silent, his expression unreadable.

“If you could tell me where your daughter went, I could help check on her and see if she’s doing well,” Clara Joy offered, trying to bridge the gap.

The Island Master slumped into a chair, just then, an elderly woman emerged from inside.

“Old man, stop being stubborn. You’ve known for a long time that you’ve let down the islanders. Why can’t you admit it? Deep down, you’re still worried about your daughter; I know.”
