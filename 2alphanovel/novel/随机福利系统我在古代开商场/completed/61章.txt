**Receiving Huang Xin**

"Haitang, what's going on?" 

"Auntie, please tell us what's happening. We can help you figure something out," Chen Zihao said, furrowing his brow.

The woman glanced at the clan leader and then at Chen Zihao. 

"The second son of the Xue family has taken a liking to my daughter and insists on making her his concubine."

"When did Huang Xin meet the second son of the Xue family?" The elderly clan leader looked at Huang Xin, who was crying in despair, nearly unable to stand, being supported by Chen Zihao's guards.

"Two days ago, Xin'er and I went out to sell the pouches we embroidered, and we just happened to run into that second son of the Xue family. He took a liking to Xin'er and forced us to tell him where we lived. He said he’d come to take her away in two days—tomorrow, to be exact," the woman, named Haitang, sobbed.

“Grandfather Clan Leader, I don’t want to marry him; I don’t want to be a concubine!” Huang Xin suddenly knelt before the clan leader.

The old clan leader sighed and looked towards Chen Zihao. “Dongjia, can I trouble you?”

“To be honest, Grandfather Clan Leader, my family has just had some issues with the Xue family recently. If this matter escalates and we offend them, it might not only jeopardize Huang Xin’s safety but also our seafood business in Xiaoyu Village. After all, the Xue family is connected to the county magistrate’s family,” Chen Zihao's expression turned difficult.

This was truly a tough situation. The Xue family's influence was starting to overshadow Chen's family.

The family had advised against provoking the Xue family for the time being. 

“Dongjia, could you secretly take Xin'er away? I can tell everyone that she left on her own,” Haitang suddenly suggested.

“Auntie, my family doesn’t allow me to have any women around. This...”

Huang Xin listened to everyone’s discussion, her heart sinking deeper. Was there really no other way out for her?

"Miss Shu, may I ask you for a favor?"

"You want us to take Huang Xin with us?"

"Only you can help her."

“What do you want us to do? Even Chen Gongzi knows it’s tricky to go against the Xue family, let alone us outsiders.” Shu Yuek can politely declined; she was reluctant to get involved in any trouble.

“If we were to leave today, I would agree without hesitation. But we still have a few days here. Facing the Xue family is clearly not a wise choice.”

“I can help the girl get ready and disguise her as your maid. We can take her back to the inn, and she won’t come out until you all leave. What do you think of this plan?"

“But the innkeeper knows how many of us are checked in. If I take one more back today, and the second son of the Xue family comes tomorrow to find her missing, it would be easy for him to find out.”

“I can handle the innkeeper. As long as the young lady is willing, it can be done.”

Shu Yuek can hesitated. In town, the Xue family was a significant power.

Her relationship with the Xue family had already soured due to business dealings. If the Xue family found out about this, it could easily become a trigger for further conflict.

“Miss, please take me with you! I’m willing to be your servant; I’d rather do that than become the second son’s concubine.” Huang Xin, seeing no other option, crawled towards Shu Yuek can on her knees.

“Please, I am begging you. I would work tirelessly for you.”

“That second son of the Xue family is not a good man. Any concubine he takes will suffer. Please, save me!”

“Miss, I’m not useless either. I know how to prepare seafood. I can handle any seafood dish.”

Shu Yuek can was somewhat moved by this.

“Third Sister, save her!” Shu Yuqin tugged at Shu Yuek can's sleeve and whispered.

“Don’t worry, I can ensure the people at the inn will keep quiet. So even if the Xue family discovers she’s missing tomorrow, they won’t suspect you.”

“Miss, I also beg you! I can’t let the girls from our clan fall into a fire pit!”

“Alright, since Chen Gongzi can assure me that the innkeeper will be silenced, I will take her in.” 

Everyone's faces lit up with smiles.

Haitang also knelt before Shu Yuek can, pulling Huang Xin along as they thanked her repeatedly. "Thank you, Miss! Thank you for saving her life!"

“However, if you follow me, you must be loyal, and you will have almost no chance of seeing your parents again.”

Huang Xin swayed slightly, glancing at her mother.

“It’s fine; not seeing you is okay, as long as I know you’re safe,” Haitang said, smoothing Huang Xin’s hair.

“Mother, I’m unfilial; I can’t honor you and Father anymore,” Huang Xin bowed her head deeply.

Seeing this, Shu Yuek can felt a pang of guilt.

“Chen Gongzi, let’s wander around the village a bit more. There are many places I haven’t seen yet.”

Chen Zihao understood her intention. “Then I’ll personally show you around.”

“Why don’t you tidy up and chat with your family? We’ll come back to get you when we’re ready to leave.”

“Thank you, Miss.”

Shu Yuek can nodded and started to leave.

“Miss, wait a moment.”

“Grandfather Clan Leader, please write a contract of servitude. I am willing to serve the Miss to repay her kindness.”

“There’s no need for that. I need someone who can handle seafood. You don’t have to sell yourself to me; just be loyal. Work hard in my business and earn plenty of money, and you can eventually bring your parents to live with us, and you can honor them."

Huang Xin was skilled and would find her place in her business, relieving her of one worry.

As Shu Yuek can and the others exited, they ran into Huang Xin’s father, who returned with a troubled expression.

“Good day, Dongjia.”

The man looked at Chen Zihao and forced a smile.

“Zhongyi, don’t worry. We have good news at home; hurry back!”

Under Chen Zihao’s guidance, Shu Yuek can explored Xiaoyu Village.

“Chen Gongzi is truly a good person. The villagers speak of you with immense gratitude!” Shu Yuek can couldn’t help but exclaim.

“It’s all exaggerated. I’ve only done a small thing,” Chen Zihao replied modestly.

“To you, it may be small, but to these villagers, it’s significant,” Shu Yuqin interjected, still feeling quite impressed with Chen Zihao.

“Chen Gongzi’s supply must extend beyond just Xiaoyu Village; otherwise, it wouldn’t be sustainable,” Shu Yuek can suddenly turned the conversation back to business.

She had decided to negotiate the seafood business with the Chen family.

“Don’t worry, there are many villages supplying seafood to my family. Whatever quantity you need, we can provide,” Chen Zihao replied with a smile.

“However, I must remind you, some people can’t eat seafood, so be cautious when you open your restaurant to avoid any trouble from them.”

Shu Yuek can took this warning to heart.

“Thank you, Chen Gongzi, for the reminder. I will visit the trading firm tomorrow to discuss our business.”
