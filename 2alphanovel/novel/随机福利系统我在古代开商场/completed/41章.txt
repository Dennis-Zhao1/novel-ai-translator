One Thing Completed

Clara Joy waited until Summer Ling had resolved her issues before stepping inside with her. 

“Thank you for helping me out back there.” 

“I genuinely want to buy it, not just to bail you out,” Summer Ling replied, her expression still skeptical. 

“But I’ve been trying to sell this shop for ages, and no one’s interested. The location is just too bad.” Clara raised an eyebrow. 

“To me, location isn’t that important.” 

Alright then, seeing how clear Clara was about her decision, Summer Ling decided not to press the matter further. 

The two signed the contract, and Clara purchased the shop for three hundred and fifty taels, which included everything inside and the backyard of the property. Clara handed over the money, and they agreed to go to the county office later to finalize the paperwork, officially making the shop hers. 

Standing in the center of the shop and glancing around, Summer Ling couldn’t help but shed a few tears. 

“I really feel like I’m not doing well. After my parents passed away, I couldn’t even keep this shop.” 

“Let’s hope it really turns out like you said, and you can bring this shop back to life,” she said, calling Clara to head to the county office for the contract formalities. 

“What do you plan to do in the future?” 

“I haven’t really thought about it. It’s tough for a woman to build a career in this era. Maybe I’ll just use the money from selling the shop to buy a few acres of land, collect some rent, and get by for the rest of my life.” 

“Why not work with me?” Clara Joy suddenly asked. 

This was an idea she had just come up with. Summer Ling and Song Qingqing could manage the clothing and fabric stores in the marketplace later on. 

“Work with you? What do you have in mind?” 

“I bought this shop because I want to continue the stable acquisition of fabrics like when you were here, and also reach out to the seamstresses you used to work with to make clothes.” 

“Actually, I’m planning to open a large marketplace in the county, which will include an adult section for ready-made clothing, underwear, shoes, and socks, as well as a children’s section for their clothing and shoes, and a fabric store. You can continue to acquire fabrics and create clothing and socks of different styles, plus some fabric dolls for kids to play with. In other words, we’ll turn this place into a workshop, and you’ll be the workshop manager,” Clara explained to Summer Ling. 

Clara thought that if Summer Ling were still around, those seamstresses would be more familiar with her, and since Summer Ling had a strong personality, she would likely be capable of managing the workshop. 

“If that’s the case, can we hire a lot of women to work?” Summer Ling asked excitedly. 

“Of course! This workshop will only hire women.” 

“That’s wonderful! This way, we can help some women improve their status at home. I’m willing to accept.” 

“I haven’t even mentioned the salary yet, and you’re already willing?” 

“It doesn’t matter how much; it’s better than doing nothing at all.” 

“At first, the marketplace won’t be open, and you’ll need to start the workshop to survive and ensure the production chain is ready. So, once it opens, the workload will be heavy, and it’ll be tiring. I’ll pay you ten taels a month, but you’ll be in charge of the workshop. You’ll decide how many workers to hire, what their wages will be, and manage the fabric purchases. I’ll provide you with clothing designs, various patterns, doll designs, and help with new styles development.” 

“If you do well later on, I’ll increase your salary. As long as you work hard, I won’t treat you unfairly.” 

Clara removed her comforting hand from Summer Ling’s shoulder. 

“Alright, I’m willing to give it a try.” 

So, Clara and Summer Ling signed a confidentiality agreement and a long-term labor contract for ten years. 

Although it’s said that one should not doubt those they employ, they had only just met. Signing a confidentiality agreement could prevent Summer Ling from leaking information about the workshop if someone tried to bribe her. 

Clara had bigger plans beyond just clothing—she was also thinking about women’s underwear, sanitary pads, and other products. 

These were all potential lucrative businesses in this ancient setting. 

After handling things at the county office, Clara took Summer Ling to her home and explained how to transform the fabric store into a workshop. 

“When the fabrics and cotton come in, they’ll be stored in the backyard. The shop will be emptied out to make room for worktables, like desks for the workers. The shop is quite large and can fit three rows of tables, each divided into three groups, with each group responsible for making different items.” 

Next, Clara excused herself to her room to retrieve some items she had just been rewarded with. 

“This is the design for adult clothing, to be made by Group One.” 

“This is the design for children’s clothing, to be made by Group Two.” 

“And this is the design for shoes, to be made by Group Three.” 

Clara pulled out two thousand taels in silver notes and handed them to Summer Ling. 

“Every expense must be accounted for. For example, if I give you two thousand taels on the first of April, you’ll need to keep track of how much you spent on renovating the shop, how much was used for purchasing items, and how much you paid the seamstresses—all must be documented clearly. If you run out of money, just ask me; I’ll check the accounts.” 

“Got it, boss.” 

Summer Ling listened carefully, storing Clara’s words in her mind. 

When Summer Ling left, Clara had Song Qingqing follow along to learn. 

She planned for Song Qingqing to manage the adult section. 

While Summer Ling might be tougher, Song Qingqing was also a girl with ideas, and Clara trusted her more since they were friends. 

She wasn’t worried about Song Qingqing’s ability; as long as she was willing to learn, she could handle things on her own. 

“Master, you’re back!” 

After sending off Song Qingqing and Summer Ling, Zhang Lanlan and Yan Xu arrived. 

“Is this the werewolf? Aside from the awkward walking, it doesn’t seem that different from a human,” Zhang Lanlan remarked, looking at Clara Joy. 

But Clara just grimaced at her. 

Clara patted Clara Joy’s shoulder to comfort her. 

“Don’t provoke him; he’s fierce. He almost bit me just now,” Shu Yuqin pouted, looking unhappy. 

“Master, we need to talk to you about something.” 

“Go ahead,” Clara said, sending Clara Joy off to play while she took a seat. 

“We heard about your plans to open a marketplace and wanted to get involved.” 

“And we can each contribute five thousand taels to help you.” 

“I was actually planning to discuss this with you,” Clara nodded. 

“You don’t need to worry about the money. As for what you’ll be doing in the marketplace, I already have ideas for you, but you can only start once it’s open.” 

“Master, can you give us a hint about what we’ll be doing?” Zhang Lanlan asked like a curious child. 

“You’ll be the manager of the children’s section. I’ve seen the dolls you make, so I figured you’d enjoy working with kids.” 

“Wow, Master really understands me! I just love adorable little children!” 

“And Yan Xu, if you have free time during this period, you should go out and have some fun, learn about the leisure activities men enjoy.” 

Yan Xu’s expression changed. 

“Master, you’re not sending me to those kinds of places, are you? Where men go to have fun?” 

“Of course not! I’m opening a proper leisure area, like for throwing pots or playing chess, and stuff like that…”
