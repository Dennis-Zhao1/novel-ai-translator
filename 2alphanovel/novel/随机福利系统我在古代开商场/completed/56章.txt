### A Complicated Heart

"You finally woke up! Do you have any idea how worried I was? I didn’t even have any healing elixirs on me." Clara Joy's eyes were brimming with tears.

"It's okay now, I'm fine." Ethan Jade raised his hand, wanting to gently touch Clara's face.

"Ah!" 

"Don't move; your arm is badly injured," Clara said quickly.

"What about him?" Ethan asked.

"He left. He said to tell you that you owe him five hundred taels of silver."

Ethan's face twitched. This guy really held a grudge. She had charged him five hundred taels as a consultation fee for treating his illness.

"But I offered him the money, and he refused to take it. What a strange guy," Clara complained.

"Still, he did save us. You shouldn’t talk about him like that."

Clara promptly covered her mouth.

"You're right; we should be grateful to him. If it weren't for him, we would be in a much worse situation right now."

Ethan felt a bit puzzled at those words. 

"That day? How long was I unconscious?"

"Almost four days. The doctor said you were too exhausted and then got injured, which caused you to faint."

"Well, I guess I finally got enough rest," Ethan joked about her situation.

"Master, you're finally awake! Let me go fetch you some chicken soup." 

Thanks to Ethan's help, they had been brought to Liu'an County, where a doctor was called to treat their injuries. Half Summer had the least severe injuries, and since Ethan hadn’t woken up by yesterday, she borrowed a small stove from the inn to simmer chicken soup.

Seeing Autumn going out again, Ethan took a few bottles of healing elixir from her storage bag and handed them to Clara.

Then she opened a bottle and drank some, letting Clara apply it to her injured areas.

"Later, give some of the healing elixirs to Autumn and Brother Shuxin so they can take care of themselves."

Clara’s injury was on her back, so Ethan had her take off her shirt to apply the elixir.

When Autumn and Half Summer received the elixir, they were puzzled.

Since their master had such good medicine, why didn’t the second mistress bring it out for her to use earlier?

But they kept their thoughts to themselves, burying their confusion deep inside.

Ethan didn’t ask Clara to explain either; since they were the ones who bought it, they should know how to keep their mouths shut.

After lying in bed for another day, Ethan decided it was time to explore Liu'an County and check out the market to recruit some martial artists.

After asking the innkeeper for directions to the market, she set off with Clara and the others.

On the way, they passed by a bridge where they found a man who had jumped into the water, but he had already been rescued.

"Just let me die! My life has no meaning anymore. I’ve struggled for decades from a poor family just to end up not even passing the scholar's exam, and I’ve exhausted my parents to death," the man opened his eyes and lamented, feeling even worse now that he was rescued.

Ethan, hearing that he was a scholar, thought about her plan to recruit talented individuals and decided to approach him.

She soon learned that this man was a student who had intended to take the scholar’s exam, but due to a conflict with a wealthy family, he was prevented from leaving his home and ended up missing the exam.

He lamented the fact that he had consumed all his family's savings for his studies, and now that his parents had both died from exhaustion, he felt utterly useless and wanted to take his own life.

"Seeking death now would be the most unfilial act towards your parents," Ethan said coldly.

"But all the money has been spent on my studies. My path to becoming a scholar has been blocked by others. I no longer wish to take the exam. For me, dying is a way to avoid disgrace for my parents," he replied despairingly.

"There are many paths to success; you can find other ways to make a living."

"Other ways? I can't farm; I’m not strong enough to carry anything. Besides, my family doesn’t even own any land."

Hearing this, Ethan didn’t want to continue the conversation. This wasn’t the kind of person she wanted to recruit.

But Clara was angered by the man’s words and wanted to argue with him.

"You can work for others! If you earn money in the future, living well is another way to repay your parents," she insisted.

"With your current attitude of despair, your parents in the afterlife would be restless."

Clara’s words became more intense, and she couldn't help but curse him out.

Ethan pulled her back, not wanting Clara to waste any more breath on him.

"That’s enough. If you still want to seek death, go ahead."

Seeing Ethan about to leave, the man quickly grabbed her pant leg.

"You’re right, I can’t do this! I’m being unfilial. Would you consider taking me in? I, Huang Qing, will definitely be loyal to you in the future."

Ethan pushed him away.

"I’m a merchant; how can you accept the transition from scholar to merchant? We’re not noble ladies."

Huang Qing was taken aback. He just wanted someone to rely on, but he didn’t want to become a merchant; that was the lowest of the low.

"Since you’ve persuaded me, you should help me continue living," Huang Qing said, desperate.

"You seem wealthy; can you spare some silver? I’ll ask Lord Zhou for forgiveness and continue my studies. Once I pass the exam, I will repay you," he pleaded.

Ethan became increasingly annoyed by his persistence. Before he could finish his sentence, she kicked him back into the river.

After a while, Huang Qing’s cries for help grew softer and softer, and only then did Ethan instruct Autumn to go rescue him and toss him back onto the bridge.

The group then ignored Huang Qing and continued on their way.

"I didn’t expect to encounter such a character," Ethan remarked, nodding. Next time, she truly wouldn’t waste her breath on just anyone.

Upon arriving at the market, they indeed found several martial artists, but Ethan only recruited three from among them.

Two men and one woman; one of the men was older, while the other man and woman were only slightly older than Ethan. They were a brother-sister pair.

Ethan brought them back to the inn, had Autumn buy them some new clothes, and let them clean up.

"Master," one of the new recruits greeted.

Ethan looked at the three of them, now clean and refreshed, with satisfaction.

"Please bestow names upon us," they requested.

"The older man will be called Shu Cheng. The siblings will be named Cèbǎi and Yùjīn."

"Uncle Cheng and Cèbǎi will follow Brother Shuxin, while Yùjīn will stay with me."

Before this, Ethan had asked Clara about Yùjīn, who had been hesitant to take her in because she was quiet and didn’t know how to interact with her.

Once everything was arranged, Ethan realized they needed more transportation, as one cart wouldn’t be enough. So, she took Autumn and Yùjīn to the market to buy a gentle horse.

Seeing that the horse had a yellow coat, she named it Dàhuáng (Big Yellow).

With Yùjīn and Cèbǎi driving the carts, Ethan and the others continued their journey the next day.

Although Autumn and the others were healing, riding still caused them some pain.

Now, Ethan and Clara, along with Autumn and Half Summer, shared one cart driven by Yùjīn, while Brother Shuxin and Uncle Cheng shared another cart driven by Cèbǎi.

The reasoning behind having Uncle Cheng and Cèbǎi follow Shuxin was because, in Ethan and Clara’s hearts, Shuxin was not a servant but their friend or perhaps an older brother.
