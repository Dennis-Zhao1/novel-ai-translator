**A Tragic Encounter**

“Are you brave enough to hit me?” the sleazy man clutched his face, his eyes wide with disbelief.

Clara Joy rubbed her hand, then took out a handkerchief to wipe it clean. She hadn’t even finished explaining herself to Ethan Jade. Although she tried her best to avoid offending anyone, there were times when a little self-defense was necessary, especially against someone as shameless as him.

“Are you still complaining about me dirtying your face? Come on, everyone, get her!” The sleazy man waved his hand at his minions, his face contorted in anger.

In an instant, Clara’s friends, Qiu Sang and Ban Xia, rushed to her side. The three of them didn’t even need to put in their full strength; the minions were already sprawled on the ground, unable to get up.

“You—you better wait for me!” The sleazy man stuttered, his bravado evaporating as he turned and ran away, leaving his fallen entourage behind.

“That’s the county magistrate's younger brother! Little girl, you’ve really gotten yourself into trouble now,” one bystander warned.

Clara Joy fell silent. She remembered that Zhang Lanlan had told her that her father had no siblings, and she was the only child of the magistrate and his wife, which meant they spoiled her quite a bit.

“Now, can you sell those people to me?” Clara Joy asked the slave trader.

“Of course, of course!” the trader replied eagerly.

“How much?”

The trader rubbed his hands together, hesitating for a moment, but he quickly realized that the girl in front of him was not someone to mess with. “Twenty taels of silver will do.”

Clara Joy didn’t want to haggle. She reached into her purse and handed the trader twenty taels without a second thought. “Now, give me the slave contract.”

Once she received the contract and ordered the bindings off the two girls, Clara Joy led them away.

Not long after, they encountered the sleazy man again.

“That’s her! She just hit me on the street! You have to arrest her!” He pointed at Clara Joy, shrinking back as he spoke.

“Miss Clara?” the head constable asked, looking at her curiously.

“Yes, I did hit him, but it’s because he was being disgusting,” Clara Joy replied, crossing her arms defiantly.

The head constable nodded, then turned to the sleazy man. “Young Master Zhang, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. Miss Clara is the teacher of the young lady and has helped the county magistrate with various issues.”

Hearing this, the sleazy man, despite his deep-seated resentment towards Clara Joy, had no choice but to back down. 

“Ah, it’s all just a misunderstanding! Just a misunderstanding!” he quickly corrected himself, attempting to smile.

“Miss Clara, I truly apologize for the disturbance,” the head constable said, bowing slightly.

“It’s nothing,” Clara Joy replied simply.

There were some things she needed to discuss with Zhang Lanlan in person.

Once they returned home, Clara Joy first prepared hot water for the two girls and then gave them two sets of her own clothes to change into after their baths.

“Thank you, Mistress,” the older sister said gratefully.

“What are your names?”

“We are sisters without names. Please bestow us with names, Mistress,” the older sister replied, pulling her younger sibling, Ban Xia, to kneel on the ground.

Clara Joy approached to help them up, but they instinctively recoiled. 

“Get up,” she said, retracting her hand.

She had no idea what these sisters had endured.

“Then let the older sister be named Qiu Sang and the younger sister be named Ban Xia,” Clara Joy decided after some thought, opting for pleasant-sounding names inspired by herbs.

“Thank you for your names, Mistress.” The sisters knelt again in gratitude.

Clara Joy didn’t stop them. Now that they were in this era, they had to adapt to the customs of bowing. As they accumulated more people, it was essential to establish rules.

“Master, you got into trouble this morning. Why didn’t you let the constables come find us?” Zhang Lanlan’s voice preceded her arrival.

Clara Joy smiled at her, surprised that this time Zhang Lanlan wasn’t with Ethan Jade.

“It was just a small issue, and I’ve already resolved it,” Clara Joy said, settling into a chair with a smile.

“I heard from the constable that it was my cousin who caused you trouble. He’s quite the nuisance, always stirring up trouble,” Zhang Lanlan replied, her distaste evident.

“I’m fine, but I’ll warn you, he's been flaunting the fact that he’s the younger brother of your father around town,” Clara Joy cautioned.

“If that’s the case, I’ll be sure to have a word with my father,” Zhang Lanlan said, her expression turning serious for once.

Clara Joy nodded. It was always pleasant talking to intelligent people who understood without needing everything spelled out.

Because Qiu Sang and Ban Xia were injured, Clara Joy and the others postponed their trip south.

“Ding! Reward for the master: a sword,” a familiar voice chimed in Clara Joy's mind after a long silence.

“I thought you had disappeared!” Clara Joy replied, lounging on her bed and engaging with the voice.

“Not at all! The system just wasn’t sure what to reward you with. It finally came up with something,” the voice, soft and sweet, explained.

“Ah, ah, go away! You all go away!” Clara Joy exclaimed suddenly, leaping from her bed and racing towards the quarters of Qiu Sang and Ban Xia.

“Ban Xia! I’m here! Don’t be scared!” she called as she pushed the door open, finding Qiu Sang cradling Ban Xia, comforting her.

At that moment, Shu Yuqin also arrived, and Shu Xin stood outside the door.

Clara Joy and Shu Yuqin sat beside Qiu Sang, quietly offering their support.

It took over an hour for Ban Xia to calm down, and then Clara Joy gave her a needle to help her sleep.

Seeing Qiu Sang curled up, looking lost, Clara Joy firmly pulled her into her embrace. “Don’t worry, we’re here now.”

As those words left her lips, Qiu Sang couldn't hold back any longer and burst into tears.

“It’s all my fault! I should have protected my sister better! It’s all my fault!” she sobbed.

“If I hadn’t gone out that day to plead with them to save our mother, my sister wouldn’t have been ruined!” she cried.

Clara Joy was taken aback; she hadn’t realized it was that serious. No wonder Ban Xia seemed so quiet and fearful.

“After that, they used my sister to threaten me. Because of that, I lost my own purity too. I hate them! I hate them!” Qiu Sang clutched her hair in frustration.

Clara Joy held her hand tightly, wrapping her arms around her, while Shu Yuqin comforted Qiu Sang’s back.

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” Clara Joy whispered soothingly.

“I want to kill them to avenge my sister!” Qiu Sang’s eyes locked onto Clara Joy with fierce determination.

Clara Joy paused for a moment before responding firmly, “Okay.”

“Aren’t you going to ask who they are?” Qiu Sang pressed.

“It doesn’t matter who they are; anyone who does something like that is lower than beasts and deserves to die,” Clara Joy said, her tone sharp and resolute.

Qiu Sang felt a jolt of surprise. Ever since the incident, not even their relatives had stood up for them; no one had spoken on their behalf. To think that someone would actually understand...

“They are the grandchildren of the prime minister.”

Clara Joy and Shu Yuqin exchanged a glance.

“Micro, do these two sisters hold any hostility towards me?”

“No, in fact, they feel grateful towards you for understanding them. Their hatred is real,” the voice replied.

Clara Joy sighed with relief.

“Unfortunately, our enemies are also connected to the prime minister,” she murmured.

Although Clara Joy’s sisters had never openly discussed the women who had harmed them, they had long regarded her as an enemy. Even if that woman never sent anyone to harm them again, they would never forgive her.
