**Epilogue**

Ethan Jade and his friends continued their journey, and on Tai'an Ridge, they unexpectedly ran into Clara Joy, who was heading home.

"What's the deal with that Young Master Xu behind you?" Ethan teased Clara with a mischievous grin.

"Just a regular friend, out for some fun," Clara replied, trying to downplay the situation.

"I don’t know; it looks to me like he’s more than just a friend," Clara's sister, Shuyuqin, chimed in, skeptical of Clara's nonchalance.

Glancing over her shoulder, Clara chose to ignore their banter, focusing on her path home. Upon returning, she discovered that the shopping mall was still under construction. 

Ethan decided he had time to reorganize the remaining plans before the grand opening. In the meantime, he spent his days training the workers he had hired.

On the fifteenth of August, the shopping mall finally opened its doors. That day, it buzzed with people, nearly overwhelming Ethan and his crew.

A month flew by since the opening, and they had already earned a tidy sum of ten thousand taels of silver. Just five days after the opening, Shuxin, Clara’s brother, decided to enlist in the army alongside Shucheng, feeling the need to protect their family from old enemies, particularly since they were aware of the significant threats looming over them.

Another year passed, and Ethan’s family had become the wealthiest in Cheng'an County. They had made numerous wealthy acquaintances and expanded their influence significantly. 

Young Master Xu had been following Clara for a whole year, even though Clara often treated him coolly.

"Elder Sister, why isn’t Young Master Xu with you today?" Ethan asked as he strolled to the fifth floor, spotting Clara resting.

"I have no idea," Clara replied absentmindedly.

"Elder Sister, he left a letter for you!" Ethan exclaimed, finally catching Clara's attention.

As she opened the letter, a hollow feeling settled in her heart for reasons she couldn't quite understand.

"Elder Sister, if you have feelings for him, then go after him!" Ethan urged.

"Yeah, he’s already taken ninety-nine steps towards you; the last step is up to you," Shuyuqin added.

"I... I don't even know how I feel about him," Clara stammered.

"We can all see that you have feelings for him," Ethan insisted.

"Elder Sister, if you hesitate any longer, you might miss your chance!" Shuyuqin urged, anxiously tapping her foot.

Hearing this, Clara froze for a moment before suddenly sprinting outside.

In the end, she caught up with Young Master Xu, and they confirmed their relationship.

Seeing that the mall was thriving even without their main players, Ethan began to think of other plans. He instructed Yujin and Qiushang to gather all the beggars and orphans, bringing them into their fold. They then built a school where boys could learn martial arts and literature, while girls could learn to read and engage in the arts.

This act of kindness made Ethan well-known in Cheng'an County, further solidifying their reputation.

Five years later, Ethan’s family had established shopping malls across the southern region of the country. The students who trained in martial arts became a part of Ethan's growing influence.

He established Bian'an Courtyard, which appeared to be a security agency on the surface but secretly targeted the corrupt elites.

Once Ethan confirmed his feelings for Clara, he assigned people to keep her company. Whenever threats arose from the capital, Ethan was always the first to appear.

After five years, both Clara and Ethan had solidified their feelings. This time, Clara was fully prepared as they headed to the capital to establish a shopping mall.

During these five years, Shuxin honed her exceptional martial skills and rose to the rank of General.

Upon arriving in the capital, with Ethan's assistance, the three of them discovered that the Su family was their biological father’s family. They went directly to the Su manor to reveal their identities. Faced with the public's gaze, their father had no choice but to let them enter.

At last, they encountered Shen Sumei, the one who had been orchestrating their assassination attempts.

The trio plotted daily at the Su house to irritate Shen Sumei. Though they infuriated her time and again, they lacked concrete evidence.

With the combined efforts of Ethan and Shuxin, they unearthed numerous corruption allegations against Shen Sumei's father, the Chancellor, and exposed them to her maternal family.

With no support left, Shen Sumei found herself isolated, and under Ethan and Clara's manipulations, she was cast aside.

Seizing the opportunity, they stealthily eliminated her before anyone could notice.

After avenging their grievances, the sisters ensured their father lost his position as well.

With that settled, they began preparations to open a shopping mall in the capital.

During this time, Shuyuqin met a prince named Gu Yunting, who was unable to walk and could only sit due to a disability. Despite his initial intentions to use Shuyuqin to suppress Ethan and seize the throne, he gradually fell for her pure and kind-hearted nature.

Ultimately, he failed in his bid for the throne against Ethan and relinquished his obsession, choosing instead to lead a secluded life with Shuyuqin.

Once Ethan ascended to the throne, he invited Clara to be his Empress. Clara pouted, feigning displeasure, and laid down several demands before agreeing.

Yet Clara never abandoned her business aspirations, frequently traveling far and wide to negotiate collaborations.

Initially, some ministers voiced concerns. However, over time, most of the court officials became aligned with Clara's vision.

With each mall she opened, a school was established in the county. Many students studying literature succeeded in the imperial examinations, filling the court, while the martial arts students assisted Shuxin in protecting the southern kingdom.

Gradually, no one dared to speak ill of Clara in the court, and some officials even suggested abolishing the selection of concubines.

Ethan doted on Clara, allowing her to do as she pleased, leading to a harmonious reign for her as Empress.

When Clara married Young Master Xu, Shuyan and Bai Zhirou also entered the picture, providing support from her maternal family.

Though the three sisters married into different families, they often gathered, each having found her ideal partner.

Twenty years passed, and Ethan handed the throne to their son, enjoying leisurely travels with Clara. When they grew tired, they would return to spend time with Shuyan and Bai Zhirou.

Living a life of fulfillment and joy, Clara wore a smile of happiness every day.
