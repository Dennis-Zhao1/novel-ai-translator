**The Drugging**

Clara Joy sensed a sound and quickly glanced over at Song Qingqing, who appeared completely unfazed. A slight breath of relief escaped her as she bid her farewell and headed towards the secluded woods.

“Don’t worry, Host. The system is exclusively yours; no one else will notice. Hurry and prepare to claim your rewards,” came the voice in her mind.

Clara concentrated, trying to sense anything unusual, but she felt nothing out of the ordinary.

“Where are you?” she inquired.

“I am one with you, but intangible. You won’t be able to perceive me,” replied the system.

“One with me? So you know everything about me and could easily harm me?” Clara asked, her tone laced with caution.

“I wouldn’t! I only know what you choose to share with me, and I would never harm you. I’m a benefits system designed to reward you with useful items. My existence depends entirely on your wishes,” the system, named Weiwei, replied, its tone growing increasingly anxious, though the volume diminished with each word.

Listening to Weiwei, Clara detected a hint of defensiveness and fear, realizing that the system was rather sincere.

“Didn’t you mention rewards?” she prompted.

“Oh, yes!” 

As soon as Weiwei finished speaking, a set of silver needles appeared in Clara's hand out of thin air.

Clara opened the case of needles and immediately fell in love with them, gently bending one to test its flexibility. In her past life, she had studied traditional Chinese medicine and had come across many acupuncture needles. However, the quality and sheen of this set were exceptional. Most importantly, these needles were soft yet resilient, unlike the stainless steel ones that had become common due to breakage issues during acupuncture. She had just tested one and found it remarkably durable.

“Anything produced by the system is guaranteed to be top-notch. Don’t you think I’m truly useful?” Weiwei chirped excitedly.

Clara nodded in agreement, recognizing the timing of the needles' appearance as crucial to her and her sisters' potential rescue.

“Just remember, you said I could make you disappear with a single word. So you better not deceive me or do anything that could harm me,” she warned.

“Weiwei would never lie or act against your interests. My original creator designed me to assist people like you who come from alternate worlds, which is why I can only bond with those who share that origin,” Weiwei explained earnestly.

“Your original creator must be quite remarkable to have created a system like you,” Clara remarked.

“She was indeed, but she has been gone for a very long time—perhaps thousands or even tens of thousands of years; it's hard for me to recall.” 

“Did you not encounter any other masters along the way?” Clara asked, intrigued.

“I did. Every few hundred years, I would bond with someone new, but it must be someone deemed fated by my original creator. For example, your two sisters are also from another world, yet only you were chosen, which means you are recognized as the fated one,” Weiwei elaborated.

Clara now had a clearer understanding of the system and was curious about the implications for herself. “So, based on what you just said, you only provide rewards. Does this mean I’ll have to complete tasks to earn them?”

“No, our relationship is always under your control. I won’t impose anything on you. The rewards will appear at random intervals,” Weiwei reassured her.

“Surely you must have some benefits for yourself; otherwise, there wouldn’t be a need for bonding,” Clara replied, skeptical of the arrangement.

“There are. When I bond with a host until their end of days, I earn ten merit points. Once I accumulate a thousand points, I can access the system’s cultivation world. But if I do anything to upset my host and they sever our bond, I not only lose out on those ten points but also face a penalty of losing a hundred points. Woe is me! So, I will only ever act in your best interest. Please trust me,” Weiwei said, sounding more pitiful than ever.

Hearing this, Clara felt a pang of sympathy for the system; it seemed to be more burdened by penalties than rewards, reminiscent of her past work experience. After asking so many questions, she decided to trust it for the time being, which helped her relax considerably.

“How many merit points do you have right now?” she asked.

“Ninety-nine, so you are my most important host,” Weiwei replied.

That evening, Zhou Cuihua not only had the Tang family and Zhou family prepare chicken soup but also personally bought several pounds of meat for them to cook. She even instructed Wang Rong to steam four servings of egg custard.

“I don’t know what’s gotten into Mother. She’s suddenly so nice to those little brats,” Tang said, grumbling as she prepared in the kitchen.

“Mother has her own plans. Besides, those kids were genuinely frightened,” Zhou replied, connecting Zhou Cuihua’s unusual behavior with the suggestion she had made yesterday, which the Jia family had accepted.

Tang shot Zhou a suspicious look. “Mother isn't that kind-hearted, and you’re acting a bit strange today.”

“I’m not odd at all. Hurry up and cook; otherwise, Mother will start urging us,” Zhou insisted.

“Eat up, you three. You’ve all lost weight lately,” Zhou Cuihua said as she served each of the sisters a piece of chicken.

Clara smiled sweetly and said, “Thank you, Grandma! You’re so nice!”

Zhou Cuihua's expression turned slightly sour, feeling a shiver run down her spine. What was up with this girl? So creepy.

That’s right, I’m disgusting you, you old hag, Clara thought as she chewed on her chicken, maintaining a cheerful facade in front of Zhou Cuihua.

“Rong'er, you should head back to your room. The children will be sleeping in the room next to us. I’ve already prepared it,” Zhou Cuihua said gently after finishing dinner.

Upon hearing this, Wang Rong felt a wave of warmth wash over her. It seemed like her mother truly realized her mistakes after all, considering the children were also her granddaughters.

“Thank you, Mother. Nier and the others will definitely honor you in the future,” Wang Rong said, visibly moved.

Clara watched her sister, who was touched by Zhou Cuihua's words, and thought to herself how difficult it would be for Wang Rong to handle the truth tomorrow. However, if they exposed Zhou Cuihua now, she could easily deny it, so they had to play along for the time being.

“Exactly! We will take good care of Grandma!” Shu Qingyan chimed in, emphasizing her words.

“This is some syrup I made for you. Drink it before heading to bed,” Zhou Cuihua said as she and Zhou brought in three bowls shortly after Clara and her sisters returned to their room.

“Look how nice your grandma is to you! You three are the only ones in the house besides Yu'er. Hurry, drink it while it’s hot,” Zhou said, handing the bowls over.

The sisters exchanged glances, signaling the moment had arrived!

“The syrup is too precious. We should save it for Grandma,” Clara said, acting understanding.

After breakfast the next morning, Wang Yuanyi, along with Uncle Wang He and Uncle Wang Ming, headed off to work in town, so Clara didn’t mention saving any for them. 

Zhou Cuihua’s eyes flickered. “Go on and drink. There’s more at home, and I don’t want to drink too much before bed to avoid waking up at night.”

“Alright, Grandma. You and Uncle’s wife go ahead and get busy. We’ll drink it and return the bowls shortly,” Clara replied.

Zhou Cuihua and Zhou showed no concern that the sisters wouldn’t drink. Previously, they had watched Wang Changyu drink and had been quite envious.
