"Mom, I'm feeling dizzy!"

"Keep your voice down! Do you want to wake everyone up?" Clara Joy scolded softly.

Zhou Shi shrank her neck, afraid to say another word.

"Zhou Da Jie, are you sure? Once this is done, there's no going back," a voice whispered from a hidden spot outside the door. It was Old Woman Jia, accompanied by the bearers of the sedan chair, waiting for Clara Joy and Zhou Shi to bring the girls out.

"Don't worry, I'm sure...," Clara Joy replied, gesturing with her hands.

Old Woman Jia immediately understood her meaning and showed a look of disdain but didn’t say much. With a wave of her hand, someone stepped forward to hand Zhou Shi a silver note.

"The old lady said you don’t have to return the previous payment. This time, it’s a hundred taels."

"Thank you, old lady! She’s so generous!" Zhou Shi was stunned when she heard about the hundred taels. Helping Clara Joy with this plan, she thought she might earn something in return.

"But..." Old Woman Jia's tone turned serious. "The old lady doesn’t want anyone causing trouble or hearing any bad rumors outside."

Clara Joy immediately assured her, fearful of any mishaps.

As soon as the others left, Zhou Shi leaned in close to Clara Joy. "Mom, you're amazing! You made a hundred taels so easily!"

Clara Joy puffed out her chest, feeling triumphant as she pulled a few copper coins from her pocket and handed them to Zhou Shi.

"Good work."

Zhou Shi squeezed the coins in her hand, pouting in frustration. Deep down, she cursed Clara Joy countless times but dared not voice her discontent. Even the smallest mosquito is meat, after all.

"Thank you, Mom."

After confirming that no one else was in the sedan chair, Clara Joy’s friends opened their eyes one by one. They hadn’t actually consumed the drug; they had simply poured it out of the window.

"What should we do now?" Shu Yuqin asked anxiously.

Clara Joy exchanged glances with Shu Qingyan. At this point, she felt a little nervous. Although Song Qingqing had informed her that the letter was successfully delivered to Young Master Yan, she still didn’t know whether he would believe it.

Now, they could only hope that Young Master Yan was as filial as the rumors said; that would give them at least a slight chance.

Otherwise, they could only leave it to fate!

Seeing the expressions of her two friends, Shu Yuqin realized that they weren’t completely confident either. She herself was prepared for the worst since they had just arrived in this world and lacked any foundation. It was truly difficult to escape the clutches of power.

Sensing the oppressive atmosphere, she forced a smile and tightly grasped the hands of the other two.

Clara Joy noticed this and let out a sigh. Well, even if they were to die, at least they would be together. Still, deep down, she held on to a sliver of hope.

After about an hour of travel, the sedan chair suddenly came to a stop. Clara Joy’s eyes lit up. Could it be that Young Master Yan had sent someone?

But the next moment, her hope was dashed when she heard Old Woman Jia's voice from outside the carriage.

"Hurry up! Move quickly! Get these girls onto the carriage so we can head into the city."

Upon hearing the footsteps, Clara Joy immediately closed her eyes and began to breathe steadily.

Once they were on the carriage, Clara Joy sensed another person climbing aboard.

"Girls, don’t come looking for me in the future. It was your grandmother who wanted to sell you; I'm just a servant and can’t say much," Old Woman Jia sighed as she looked at the three beautiful girls before her.

Half a stick of incense later, the carriage stopped again. Old Woman Jia lifted the curtain and poked her head out, saying, "Excuse me, officer, I am the stewardess of the old lady from the Jia family. We were delayed due to some matters."

The head guard at the city gate heard this, raised his torch, and confirmed it was indeed the Jia family’s carriage, then immediately bowed slightly.

"I wouldn’t dare to trouble you. Please, go ahead." He waved his hand behind him, signaling for them to pass.

At this moment, Clara Joy and the others had completely lost hope. If Young Master Yan truly wanted to rescue them, this would have been the best opportunity outside the city.

"Wait a moment." After another half stick of incense, a voice called from outside.

"Madam, it’s Young Master Yan." Someone whispered to Old Woman Jia.

Old Woman Jia’s face froze. Why did they have to run into this young master now?

Old Woman Jia stepped out of the carriage and saw Young Master Yan approaching with his hands behind his back, while the road ahead was blocked.

"Old Jia!" Young Master Yan called out, his voice laced with mockery. "What are you doing out here in the middle of the night, looking so nervous?"

"Young Master Yan," Old Woman Jia said respectfully, bowing her head.

"The old lady has been worried sick over the Third Master’s situation and isn’t well. I heard that there’s a miraculous doctor in Rongxin Village, so I went to fetch some medicine. The journey was long, which is why I returned late. The old lady is still waiting for me at home, so I must leave now."

After Old Woman Jia finished speaking, she noticed Young Master Yan hadn’t moved, and her heart sank.

"What do you mean by this, Young Master?"

Young Master Yan continued to walk around Old Woman Jia, his hands still behind his back. Suddenly, he stopped, "I have a feeling this isn’t as simple as it seems!" With a swift motion, he pulled back the curtain of the carriage.

"Old Jia, what’s going on here? Is this your so-called medicine?"

Old Woman Jia was terrified, but having served Old Lady Jia for decades, she had seen her fair share of situations. She steadied her nerves, ready to explain.

However, Young Master Yan didn’t give her a chance. "I know your plans, and I won’t allow this to happen. I’m taking these girls with me."

"This..."

"What’s with the hesitation? If you keep this up, I won’t mind writing a letter to my father to spread the word in the capital. I’m sure your old lady wouldn’t want the Jia family’s hard-earned reputation to be tarnished, right?"

Old Woman Jia felt unfortunate and, after weighing her options, decided to let them go. She couldn’t let this incident affect the main family members.

Despite Old Woman Jia’s words, Clara Joy and the others didn’t dare to open their eyes, fearing that Old Woman Jia might suspect their plan.

"Go back and tell your old lady that I’ve ensured the safety of these three girls. If they go missing in the future, I will come looking for you."

Upon hearing this, Clara Joy couldn’t help but want to applaud Young Master Yan. He was simply amazing!

Once Clara Joy and her friends were brought down, Young Master Yan finally gestured for Old Woman Jia to leave.

"Take them back!"

Back? Clara Joy felt confused. Did Young Master Yan not read the contents of the letter she had written, the one about curing Old Master Yan?

Cautiously, Clara Joy opened one eye, glanced around, and seeing that Old Woman Jia and her crew were nowhere to be found, she boldly opened both eyes and patted the other two.

Young Master Yan watched this scene with some surprise. Logically, they should have been drugged.

"Young Master Yan, thank you for saving us. As a reward, I will treat Old Master Yan," Clara Joy said earnestly.

Young Master Yan sized up the girl speaking and then glanced at the other two. He had to admit they were all quite pretty.

"Heh, you’re just a country girl. What do you know about medicine? Fine, I know you wrote that just to get me to save you. Now that you’re safe, just hurry back," Young Master Yan said with a chuckle.

"I really can heal!"
