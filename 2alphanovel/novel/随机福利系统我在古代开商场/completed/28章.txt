**Time Dilation Space**

Clara Joy stepped outside, ready to row her boat once again. As she arrived at her destination, she closed her eyes and felt herself transported to the cave, only to return the same way she came. 

However, Clara couldn’t quite grasp the difference—it was baffling why she seemed to arrive at a completely different place all of a sudden. She had posed her questions to her master, Ethan Jade, but he merely shrugged, admitting he had no idea either. It seemed like it might be a mechanism left behind by people from long ago.

Before Clara could reach home, she spotted two heads peeking out from behind a bush. 

“Big sister, do you think our little sister has run into trouble?” one of them asked anxiously. 

“No way,” replied the other, who had already spotted Clara and was nudging her companion. “She’s back! If she took any longer, some people would be getting frantic.” 

Clara chuckled softly, “I was worried too. Ever since mother passed, it’s just the three of us relying on each other in this strange world.” 

She pulled Clara’s younger sister, Joy, into a comforting embrace and recounted the incredible day she had experienced.

“Really? You can learn martial arts now? That’s amazing! Does that mean I could fly like those characters on TV, just like the people who tried to kill us that night?” Joy’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

Clara exchanged a knowing look with her. “That takes a lot of time, and we don’t even know if we’re cut out for it.”

After waiting for Song Qingqing to return for dinner, the three of them washed up and got ready for bed, while Song sat at the bed where Wang Rong had slept, lighting a small lamp and stitching a pouch. She had to earn money quickly to pay back San Ni.

The next day, Clara informed Song that from now on, the three of them wouldn’t be going to the fields to gather herbs—they would just let the two of them go and sell whatever they could gather.

During lunchtime, the trio bought a few buns in the county, then rode back home on an ox cart. Clara led the way to Ethan’s place afterward.

They walked into the cave, traversed a narrow path, and rowed the boat until they reached a rapid section, which suddenly opened up to a larger river below.

“Wow, this place is stunning!” Joy exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder.

“Master,” Clara and her sisters said in unison as they knelt before Ethan.

One of them held two wild chickens or rabbits in her hand—this was a stroke of luck from Clara’s last trip when they had gathered these on the mountain and placed them in their storage bags. Inside, they wouldn’t spoil and would remain fresh. They hadn’t sold them before due to a lack of opportunity.

“Home doesn’t have much, so we brought these wild creatures as a token of respect and to nourish our master’s wife,” Clara explained.

Ethan couldn’t help but smirk at the sight of the sisters. To them, this bounty of wild game might have taken considerable effort to gather on their own. Even he sometimes struggled to catch this much in a whole day.

“Dear, the kids must be kneeling for ages. Aren't you going to tell them to get up?” Ethan's wife, Bai Zhirou, said softly.

“Alright, you can all rise. No need for such formalities. Your mother also needs to eat well; you don’t have to bring everything to us,” Ethan said, noticing the varied expressions on their faces.

“To be honest, master, our mother passed away not long ago. Now it’s just the three of us holding each other up, along with a close friend who lives with us,” Clara replied, her tone somber.

Ethan was puzzled, but Bai Zhirou’s expression turned to one of compassion. 

“Did those people come after you again?” 

“No, our mother was harmed by someone and pushed onto the rocks,” Clara said, her voice trembling slightly.

“Oh, poor children! Come here. From now on, you’ll have me and your master to take care of you,” Bai Zhirou said, her voice soothing and gentle.

Joy instantly warmed to this kind, gentle woman, feeling her heart lift a bit at the mention of Wang Rong, even though it still hurt.

Clara requested Ethan to bring Bai Zhirou into the house. After checking her pulse, she gently squeezed her legs, realizing there was no sensation at all.

“I’ll use the spirit water I made with my medical master’s techniques,” Clara thought, but fearing Ethan's concern, she took a sip first before pouring a bowl for Bai Zhirou to drink.

Then, she proceeded to give her a massage and acupuncture treatment.

Once everything was done, Bai Zhirou’s tears flowed freely. 

“Husband, I can feel my legs tingling,” she wept.

“This spirit water works wonders,” Clara mused in her mind.

“Mic Mic mentioned that the system produces only the best. You should trust it now. This batch is even purer than the last. It’s unfortunate your mother passed before you could return; otherwise, even her last breath could have saved her,” Mic Mic’s voice trailed off, sensing Clara's sorrow.

Ethan, still in disbelief about Bai Zhirou’s reaction, asked, “You really feel something?”

Bai Zhirou nodded through her tears, “I do, dear.”

Despite Clara and her sisters being present, Ethan couldn’t contain his joy, lifting Bai Zhirou and spinning her around.

“Master, maybe you should put your wife down before you hurt her legs again,” Clara chuckled.

“Oh right, right! Sit down and rest.”

“Since today is the first treatment, it’s normal to see quick results. Progress might slow down later,” Clara said honestly.

“It’s okay. As long as I can heal, I’m willing to wait no matter how long it takes,” Bai Zhirou replied, her face streaked with tears yet determined.

“Alright, husband, you should go teach the children martial arts now,” she urged.

Ethan carried Bai Zhirou out again, placing a light blanket over her legs to keep her warm.

“Master, when you have time, remember to massage your legs as well,” Clara reminded.

They were then taken to a clearing beside the vegetable garden by Ethan. 

First, he had them build their stamina starting from the basics—every morning running a few laps around the village and practicing their stances. 

That day, since there wasn’t enough time for running, they only did stances.

From that day on, Clara and her sisters made it a point to wake up an hour early each morning to run laps around the village.

At first, Song Qingqing was puzzled, but seeing the sisters’ increasing vitality, she decided to join them.

However, regarding the incident with Thirteen, the three kept silent. They didn’t want anyone disturbing the peace of their master and his wife.

“Ding! Time Dilation Space awarded to the host.”

“What does that mean?” Clara was confused and inquired.

“It means that within the system’s designated space, time will pass differently—one day outside equals three months inside. But the person doesn’t age, which is greatly beneficial for your learning. The host can use it anytime and anywhere, but the space cannot exceed one hundred square meters.”

Clara was stunned. She adored this system even more now. For them to learn martial arts quickly and see results, this time dilation space was incredibly useful.

That night, after Song Qingqing had gone to sleep, Clara took Joy and Clara Joy into the yard to practice their martial arts.

As a result, after Thirteen taught them new moves and how to cultivate their inner strength the previous day, they made significant progress the next day.

Their movements became fluid and refined, and their inner strength improved dramatically.

This led Thirteen to question himself, often asking Bai Zhirou at night, “Are you sure a whole day has passed?”

Every time this happened, Bai Zhirou would gently pat Thirteen’s head to check if he was feeling unwell.
