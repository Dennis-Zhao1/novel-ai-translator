**Ghostly Encounter**

Inside the palanquin, piercing screams echoed, yet the crowd outside remained eerily silent. Zhou Cuihua, frightened to her core, cowered behind her two daughters-in-law, trembling uncontrollably.

Even Wang Rong was momentarily stunned by the cacophony of sound. After a long pause, she moved forward and lifted the curtain of the palanquin.

"My dear girls, it's my fault as your mother. I can't let you leave this world so easily!" Wang Rong exclaimed as she threw herself onto her three children.

Shu Ting, along with the two others who had been awakened by the commotion, exchanged bewildered glances at Wang Rong, listening to her heartbreaking sobs.

Shu Ting and her two companions shared a knowing look, sighing in unison. They each had suddenly gained a new memory in their minds. They realized they had time-traveled to an alternate historical era. Fortunately, they weren't strangers but had been close friends in their past lives. After a tragic car accident claimed their lives, the three sisters had summoned them here. However, the exact method by which these sisters had brought them to this world remained a mystery.

“Mom, please don’t cry. We’re not dead,” Shu Ting said, lifting her hand to pat Wang Rong's back gently.

As soon as the words left her mouth, the cries abruptly stopped.

Wang Rong pulled away from her children and saw three pairs of eyes staring back at her. She quickly pinched each of their faces and hands, exclaiming, “You’re warm! You’re really alive!”

“Yes, that's right! So please don’t be sad anymore, okay?” Shu Ting blinked her eyes innocently.

Wang Rong hurriedly wiped her face, not doubting for a second. Deep down, she had always refused to accept that her children had perished.

“Oh, thank goodness! My dear girls are back!” Wang Rong exclaimed joyfully, tightly hugging her three children.

Outside, the crowd could only hear muffled sounds from within the palanquin, unable to discern the words. Some began to wonder if Wang Rong had been “eaten by ghosts.”

“Ghosts!” Zhou Cuihua squeaked in fear, but her head kept popping out from between her two companions to peek at the palanquin. When she finally saw the three children helping Wang Rong out, she recoiled in terror.

Seeing Zhou Cuihua’s frightened expression, Shu Ting couldn’t help but smirk cunningly, a mischievous smile dancing on her lips. She glanced at her two good friends; one was still lost in thought about how they arrived here, while the other maintained her usual cool demeanor from their previous life. It seemed she would have to take the lead in this situation.

But first, she needed to calm down the villagers who were on the verge of panic. “Everyone, don’t be afraid! Since Grandma says we’re ghosts, then so be it...”

“Ah!” Some timid women shrieked in fear, some even bolting away.

“Don’t be scared! We swear we won’t harm anyone. They say every grievance has its source, and we hold no ill will toward you,” she reassured, managing to calm the frenzied crowd somewhat.

Shu Ting elbowed her companion, the second sister in this life, Shu Yuqin, while the eldest, Shu Qingyan, stood coolly to the side. They all had names that didn’t quite fit the village norms. However, in this village, they were simply referred to as “Big Girl,” “Second Girl,” and “Third Girl.”

“What’s wrong?” Shu Yuqin asked.

“Never mind that! Let’s go scare that old woman!” Shu Ting—now Shu Yueke—said, tilting her head towards Zhou Cuihua.

Shu Yuqin nodded. “Let’s go! I’ve just sorted out my memories, and that old hag is too cruel.”

Wang Rong overheard their conversation and narrowed her eyes, slipping away to the side. This scene was noticed by Shu Qingyan, who couldn’t help but show a barely perceptible smile on her otherwise cold face.

“Ah, don’t come any closer! Stay away from me!” Zhou Cuihua cried, backing away in a panic as she saw the two girls approaching.

The two women beside her, Zhou and Tang, were trembling in fear but didn’t dare to flee due to Zhou Cuihua’s imposing presence.

“Block them! Don’t let them near me!” she ordered.

Shu Yueke twisted her neck, revealing a chilling expression, while Shu Yuqin remained grinning at the three women in front of them.

As the trio kept their guard up against Shu Ting and Shu Yuqin, Shu Qingyan had already stealthily circled around to their backs.

“Grandma, even if we three sisters have died, we still remember your kindness. We specially came to inform Lord Yama to come and fetch you,” Shu Yueke said, her gaze sweeping over Zhou and Tang. Suddenly, she covered her mouth in mock surprise. “Oh, right! He also specifically instructed us to bring the second and third aunts to honor you!”

“Please, no! You three just go!” Zhou Cuihua pleaded.

Suddenly, Shu Qingyan leaned forward, her voice icy. “Let’s go, ladies.”

Meanwhile, Shu Yueke and Shu Yuqin bared their teeth, growling at Zhou Cuihua and her companions.

“Ah! Help! The ghosts want to eat me! The ghosts want to eat me!” Zhou Cuihua shrieked, her feet frozen in place as she could only wail helplessly.

“I was wrong! Please spare me! I’m just the daughter-in-law of the family. I only targeted you because my mother-in-law despises you! Blame her, not me!” Tang, the second aunt, fell to her knees with a loud thud.

Zhou Cuihua shot Tang a furious glare. Just then, she noticed something swaying beside her and turned to see Shu Qingyan playing with a brick she had found, sending a shiver down her spine.

Shu Yueke and the others caught a whiff of the smell and glimpsed the wet patch beneath Zhou Cuihua, rolling their eyes in disgust.

Zhou’s eyes reflected her discomfort, but she kept a watchful gaze on the trio, finally coming to a realization.

“If you truly remember your grandmother’s kindness, you shouldn’t scare her like this. If you’re really going to repay kindness with malice, then come at me!” Zhou retorted, indignant.

Shu Yueke sized her up. This Zhou was indeed clever; she probably saw through their little trick. But so what? They had achieved their goal.

“Indeed, the second aunt is quite filial. But I recall the last time Grandma twisted her ankle, it was you who purposely moved the stones, wasn’t it? Don’t deny it; I saw it with my own eyes. And that time you claimed to have lost money, we all know what you were really up to.”

Zhou Cuihua initially felt touched, but as Shu Yueke’s words sank in and she noticed Zhou’s evasive eyes, she understood the situation. However, she refrained from saying anything, knowing the three girls might just take her away, and Zhou could still be of use.

“You heard that? Your second aunt is willing to take my place! Take her away!” Zhou Cuihua said, completely disregarding her own embarrassing situation.

“Yes, I’m willing to take her place,” Tang chimed in.

“Clap, clap, clap!” Shu Qingyan tossed the brick aside and stepped forward, “What a show! Second Aunt’s filial piety is truly moving.”

“Yes, Second Aunt already figured out we are not ghosts but humans, yet she didn’t tell Grandma first. Instead, she let Grandma be scared, only to come forward and show off her ‘filial piety.’ How truly...”

“Are you really not ghosts?” a girl who had been quietly observing asked.

“Come here and feel for yourself!” Shu Yueke replied.

“Ah! You’re really warm! And you have shadows too! What was I thinking? I should have figured it out! How could ghosts survive in the daylight? This is wonderful! You’re alive! I was so upset hearing Grandma wanted to arrange a ghost marriage for you! I’m so relieved!” The girl exclaimed, tears streaming down her cheeks.
