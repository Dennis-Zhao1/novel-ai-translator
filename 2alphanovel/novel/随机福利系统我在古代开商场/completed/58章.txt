**No Boats Available**

As Clara Joy and her companions descended from the upper floors, they were met by a group of people waiting outside the door. The leader of the group stepped forward to greet them immediately.

"Honored guests, please this way."

Clara maintained a blank expression and walked past him, while her sister, Comfort, shot him a fierce glare.

"Lead the way," Clara said tersely.

Upon arriving at the Xue family's trading house, Clara and her party were ushered into a room.

"Master, the esteemed guests have arrived."

"Please, take a seat."

"May I ask why Master Xue summoned us? Was it necessary to make such a grand display?" Clara's expression was laced with sarcasm.

"Please do not take offense, young lady," Master Xue said, turning his attention to Comfort, "I see this fine young man is the heir of your family?"

Comfort remained silent, glancing at Clara for direction.

Master Xue, a shrewd man, quickly picked up on the tension. 

"Oh dear, my mistake! It turns out you are the true head of the family."

"Head of the family is too grand a title; I'm just a simple girl," Clara replied modestly.

"I sincerely apologize for inviting you in such a manner. Allow me to express my regrets," Master Xue continued, his tone shifting to one of formality.

"Let’s get to the point, Master Xue," Clara interjected, cutting through the pleasantries.

With a nod, Master Xue shifted gears. "You have come to our town, I presume, to purchase seafood?"

Clara didn’t deny it.

"Hasn't Master Xue already figured that out? Why ask again?"

"Presumably, you have learned that our Xue family business is the finest here in the harbor town, providing top-quality seafood. No matter where you are from, we can deliver it to you."

Clara sighed at his words. "But what can be done? I intended to discuss business with your esteemed company, but the way Master Xue conducts affairs is... less than favorable."

"I owe you an apology and hope you won't hold it against us. My actions were only aimed at bringing you here," Master Xue insisted.

"Is that really an invitation? If we hadn't come, your inn would have had no customers today, and we wouldn't have been able to leave," Clara stated bluntly, refusing to spare him any dignity.

Master Xue could only manage an awkward laugh. He had never encountered a businessperson so unapologetic, refusing to give him even an ounce of face.

"Since you're here, let’s discuss business," he suggested.

"Sorry, but let me be honest with you, Master Xue. We are looking to buy seafood, but it's just a small amount—certainly not worthy of such a grand invitation," Clara politely declined.

That evening, Comfort and the others returned, bringing news with them. 

The Xue trading house had a reputation for being ruthless, exploiting the local populace, and often buying dead seafood at low prices to sell. In stark contrast, the Chen family business was renowned for its integrity, frequently aiding the common folk and conducting business transparently.

However, Clara suspected that the Chen family must also have some tricks up their sleeves to compete with Xue.

Nevertheless, the Chen family had a far better reputation than the Xue family, which solidified Clara’s resolve to approach them for a business deal.

"How much do you wish to purchase, young lady?" Master Xue asked.

"We only want to buy a bit for ourselves. I don't understand why you think there is business to be discussed. We were merely inquiring with the innkeeper to gather information, pretending we were looking to make a large purchase to avoid being underestimated," Clara said with an innocent expression.

Master Xue was caught off guard by her response. 

He scowled, scrutinizing Clara. She sat upright, showing no signs of fear under his gaze.

Master Xue felt a surge of anger; his underlings were useless. He had expected a wealthy client, only to find that they were merely a group of travelers.

"Master Xue, can we leave now?" Clara asked, her patience wearing thin.

"Are you truly not going to place an order for seafood? Our inventory is the most comprehensive," Master Xue pressed, still unwilling to give up.

"Are we buying just a little bit, Master Xue? Do you really think we would be interested in purchasing here?" Clara feigned surprise, as if she didn’t comprehend his words.

Unexpectedly, her comment led Comfort to misunderstand, thinking Clara intended to place an order with the Xue family.

"Buy seafood, buy seafood! Sister, if we’re not purchasing here, let’s go to the Chen family; they’re much better!" Comfort exclaimed, pulling Clara towards the door.

"You're trying to deceive me!" Master Xue exclaimed.

Clara quickly shot a warning glance at Comfort. 

"Oh, dear! What are you rambling about? Have you lost your mind again?" Clara’s companion, Serenity, hurriedly pulled Comfort back.

"Does the young lady look down on our Xue family?" Master Xue recalled Clara’s words, pondering their implications. He nearly let himself be fooled by her.

Now that they had reached this point, Clara could no longer pretend.

"I don’t look down on the Xue family; I just dislike the way I'm being treated. Moreover, the reputation of the Xue family in this harbor town seems rather poor."

"Our trading house is unmatched in this town. If you don’t place an order with us, you may regret it," Master Xue said, his expression darkening.

"We've just arrived here and haven't decided where to place our order yet. There's no need for Master Xue to be angry; perhaps we could become partners in the future," Clara replied coolly.

With that, she prepared to leave.

However, Master Xue understood her words were mere excuses.

"You best not underestimate yourselves. Besides ordering from us, you have no other options. Just wait and see," Master Xue said, glaring at Clara and her companions as they turned to leave.

Clara ignored his threats, anger bubbling beneath her calm exterior. She despised being coerced.

The next day, Clara learned firsthand about the Xue family's tactics. 

She planned to explore the nearby villages, but the only means of transportation from this town to the others was by boat. After inquiring at numerous places, none were willing to take them.

Clara raised an eyebrow. This situation felt familiar; it reminded her of their run-in with the Tianfeng Gang, who had similarly made travel difficult for them.

At least back then, they had a place to stay and food to eat.

"No wonder the Xue family has such a bad reputation—this is how they treat people who don’t order from them," Clara said upon returning to the inn, where Serenity’s face was flushed with anger.

"What do we do now? Are we really supposed to go to the Xue family and beg them?" Serenity asked, frustration seeping into her voice.

"We won't go," Clara declared firmly.

"Then what do we do? We have no boats, and we can't even explore the surroundings!" Serenity’s irritation was palpable.

"Third sister, do you think I’m really that foolish? Every time something happens, all I can do is panic and not think clearly—I'm just a burden," Comfort lamented.

"You are not foolish. You know things I don’t even understand yet," Clara reassured her.

"Sister, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have said that," Comfort said, fidgeting with her clothes as she squatted beside Clara.

"It’s fine; Comfort only wants what’s best for us," Clara patted Comfort's head gently. 

"Just wait; someone will eventually be willing to give us a boat."
