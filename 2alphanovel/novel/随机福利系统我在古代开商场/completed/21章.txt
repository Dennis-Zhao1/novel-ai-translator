**Fancy Mooncake Sales**

The next morning, the family gathered for breakfast, and then it was back to the grind of making mooncakes. By evening, their arms were so sore they could barely lift them.

Seeing this, Wang Rong couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy. Ignoring the cold indifference from Shu Qingyan and Clara Joy, she took turns massaging their arms. 

“You girls work so hard. It breaks my heart to see it,” she said softly.

“We want to become the richest family in Nanyan Kingdom,” Clara Joy finally responded.

Wang Rong blinked in surprise, her eyes welling with tears. “You finally want to talk to your mother, San Ni! I realize I misjudged things before. I was wrong,” she said, her voice trembling.

“Hmm, we'll see,” Clara replied, her tone still cool but showing signs of progress.

As for Shu Qingyan, who had remained silent, Wang Rong decided not to push her. It was a process, after all.

The following day, Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan asked Li An for help with the ox cart to head to the county for their stall. This time, they brought with them a thousand mooncakes, some loose and some beautifully packaged.

With the Mid-Autumn Festival tomorrow, the county was especially lively today, as all the academies had closed early for the holiday.

“Look here! Guess the riddle and win a mooncake!” 

“Where to buy mooncakes? This stall has the best flavors!”

“Any talented scholars willing to give it a try? If you’re interested, you can also compose poetry and the winner will receive a luxurious mooncake set!” Clara Joy called out cheerfully.

Many scholars passing by stopped to listen, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers.

“This is quite an interesting event! I must join in!” an elderly voice boomed. Although he wasn’t very fluent, many students perked up at the sound.

“Excuse me, are you Elder Yan?” one brave scholar asked, his face flushed with excitement.

Elder Yan examined the student before him. “Indeed, I am,” he replied.

At this moment, Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan stepped forward and bowed respectfully to Elder Yan.

“No need for such formality. I’m just here to see your activities and perhaps scout for talent for my Mingyue Academy,” Elder Yan said casually.

Hearing this, the scholars around them grew excited. Mingyue Academy was the best in the county! No matter your background, as long as you had talent and passed their tests, you could enroll. If you came from a less fortunate family, you could even apply for financial aid!

“By the way, you’re selling mooncakes, right? I’ll buy two to try,” Elder Yan added again.

“Elder Yan coming to support us is already a huge honor! You don’t need to buy them. Big sister, wrap one of each flavor for Elder Yan,” Clara Joy said gratefully, recognizing the gesture.

The crowd watched as Elder Yan took a mooncake, unwrapped it, and began to taste it. He had initially only wanted to help promote their stall, thinking he would say nice things as long as the flavor was decent. 

But to his surprise, these mooncakes were irresistibly delicious! He couldn't stop himself. After finishing one, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “This mooncake is unlike any I’ve ever tasted! Truly exquisite!”

“Could I try the riddle?” a student gathered his courage and asked, his face reddening.

“Of course,” Elder Yan replied.

“The first riddle is: All around are mountains, and the mountains connect to each other.”

The student repeated the riddle, thinking deeply. “Is it the character for ‘field’ (田)?”

“Correct! You win a mooncake!” Clara Joy handed the mooncake over with a smile.

“Nine riddles remain. Do you wish to continue?” 

“Absolutely.”

The student answered five correctly in a row before he stumbled on the seventh. 

No other scholar dared to jump in, and even Elder Yan took a moment to ponder before he figured it out. Ultimately, it was a poor scholar, dressed in worn clothes yet looking clean, who managed to answer all the remaining riddles.

“Now that all the riddles have been solved, it’s time for poetry!” Clara Joy announced.

The scholars clustered together, each composing a poem to present to Elder Yan for judgment.

Meanwhile, the surrounding crowd, including some wealthy young ladies out for a stroll, quickly formed around Clara Joy’s stall. After all, even Elder Yan praised the taste!

Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan were busier than ever, realizing they had gained the celebrity effect.

Those with money purchased luxurious boxes, while others bought regular ones, and still others chose loose mooncakes. Regardless, everyone wanted a taste of the flavor Elder Yan had endorsed.

As the poetry contest concluded, Clara Joy had only two luxury sets left from the initial batch, while the rest had sold out.

The winner turned out to be the poor scholar, and Clara Joy proudly handed him the luxurious mooncake set. Elder Yan patted his shoulder, inviting him to enroll at Mingyue Academy after the festival.

The scholar was ecstatic, showering Clara Joy and Elder Yan with gratitude.

Watching him, the other scholars felt envy, but then they thought, even if they couldn’t join Mingyue Academy, at least they could enjoy the mooncakes that Elder Yan deemed delicious.

However, to their dismay, the mooncakes were all sold out.

Seeing the disappointed faces, Clara Joy immediately assured them, “We’ll come back tomorrow with even more mooncakes. Everyone will have a chance to buy some!”

And with that, the crowd dispersed.

Clara Joy picked up one of the mooncakes they had saved and approached Elder Yan. “Thank you, Grandpa Yan.”

Elder Yan, who had been composed just moments ago, couldn’t contain his joy as he looked at the mooncake, his face beaming with a wide smile. 

“Then I shall accept it,” he said happily.

Clara Joy nodded and informed him that they would only be able to come to the Yan residence in the afternoon to help with his health.

Elder Yan gazed longingly at the mooncake in the butler’s hands, waving him off to signal he understood.

Today, Clara Joy and her team prepared thirty luxurious mooncake boxes, selling each for five hundred coins, eighty regular mooncakes at one hundred coins each, and loose ones for six coins apiece. After deducting rewards and the ones gifted to Elder Yan, they earned a total of two hundred forty-two coins.

Afterward, they waited for Li An to arrive before heading out to buy packaging paper and beautiful wooden boxes.

“They’re all sold out!” Clara Joy exclaimed, laughing at the speechless expressions of Shu Yuqin and Wang Rong.

“That’s wonderful! That’s wonderful!” Wang Rong rubbed her hands together excitedly.

“And tomorrow will surely sell even better,” Clara Joy added confidently.

Upon hearing this, Shu Yuqin immediately chimed in, “Let’s make more and sell them all tomorrow.”

“Do we have enough mooncakes at home? We have about two thousand left, right? Let’s get the ones we need to package ready this afternoon. While making money is important, health is even more so!” Wang Rong insisted, cautious yet firm.

Clara Joy agreed; the past couple of days, they had risen early and gone to bed late, leaving them all quite exhausted.

“Ding! You’ve earned a bottle of Spirit Water as a reward.”

Just then, Clara Joy thought of something, and a voice echoed in her mind.

Wow, that’s quite intelligent, Clara Joy thought, impressed.

“I’ll go get everyone some water,” she said, heading to the kitchen. Noticing Wang Rong hadn’t followed her, she took the opportunity to gather the water, dividing it into four portions before calling for Shu Qingyan to help her carry it over.

“What kind of water is this? It tastes sweet, and it makes you feel so much lighter after drinking it!” one of them remarked.

“Really? It’s probably just because I added some sugar,” Clara Joy replied, brushing it off with a playful smile.
