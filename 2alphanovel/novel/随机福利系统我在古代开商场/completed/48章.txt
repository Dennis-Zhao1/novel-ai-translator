**Sick Horse**

That night, Clara Joy stared blankly at the remaining five thousand silver taels. There were still many things left to prepare, and she feared that this money wouldn’t be enough.

“Ah, I guess I’ll just have to make do for now,” she sighed, burying her head in her blanket.

The next day, with no clear plans, Clara decided to check on the progress of the construction in the south of the city. Ever since Old Tu started working, he had thrown himself into it completely and had even built a simple thatched hut to live in. Clara realized she had no idea what the current state of affairs was.

As she walked along the road, another thought struck her. Buying a horse was something she had been contemplating for a long time but kept forgetting. She promised herself that after checking on the construction, she would definitely buy one.

“Hey, Shu Xin, remind me to buy a horse later,” she said.

Shu Xin, after experiencing the time difference that night, felt like he had matured a lot, now able to understand simple phrases.

“Buy a horse, buy a horse,” he repeated.

“Exactly. Make sure to remind me later,” Clara confirmed.

“Okay.”

Clara handed Shu Xin a bottle of spirit water. He was now able to open the cap and drink it himself. However, he would only take small sips since Clara would only give him a bottle after a long wait.

As Clara approached, she could already see the workers bustling about from a distance. When she got closer, she was astounded; the scene was reminiscent of construction in her previous life. Old Tu had only laid the foundation so far.

“Do people in this era really know how to lay a foundation?” Clara pondered, slightly skeptical. After all, this was a fictional era that might differ from what she had learned about ancient times.

“Old Tu, welcome to the twenty-first century!” she joked.

“What? What nonsense are you spouting again, girl?” Old Tu replied, scratching his head.

Clara laughed awkwardly and approached a nearby uncle. “Is it necessary to start building like this?”

“Not really. Only wealthy families use bricks and stones for their foundations, or if they’re constructing tall buildings. Regular folks just tamp down the earth,” he explained.

So, there really was a foundation-laying method at this time. It seemed her lack of knowledge had misled her. 

“Girl, once I finish here, you have to teach me about that distillation device. I haven’t had a drop of alcohol while building this house, and it’s driving me mad!” Old Tu exclaimed.

“Don’t worry, Grandpa Tu,” Clara assured him.

After leaving the southern part of the city, Clara headed home. “Buy a horse, buy a horse,” she reminded herself, tapping her head. She couldn’t understand why her memory seemed to be failing her lately.

“Yes, yes, Shu Xin, you’re doing great!” she encouraged him.

Shu Xin beamed at her, his smile wide.

Upon reaching the horse market, Clara didn’t rush to buy immediately but took a stroll around first. 

“Miss, come and take a look at our horses,” a shopkeeper called out, and Clara paused. Today, she was dressed quite normally, and this was the first shopkeeper to approach her.

She followed him, listening to his introductions, but nothing seemed to catch her eye instantly.

“Neigh, neigh~”

As she walked past a few sick horses, one caught her attention. This horse was entirely snow-white, with not a single speck of color, although it lacked a bit of shine. It appeared utterly lifeless, struggling even to stand, yet it stubbornly tried to rise time and again. Its ears perked up, as if straining to hear the sounds around it.

When Clara stood before it, the horse summoned all its strength to stand up again, focusing intently on her.

“Boss, I want this horse!” Clara declared.

“Miss, this horse is sick. Whether it can recover is uncertain, and even if it does, it has a stubborn temperament. It might be hard to train,” the shopkeeper warned.

“That's fine, I want this one,” Clara insisted.

Seeing her determination, the shopkeeper decided not to press further, though he sold the sick horse to her for twenty taels of silver.

After the purchase, the shopkeeper released the horse and handed Clara the reins. Clara reached out to stroke the horse, which nuzzled against her hand affectionately.

She looked up at the shopkeeper. “This horse is really quite stubborn. No one in our shop has been able to get this close to it.”

As he spoke, he found it curious and reached out to try again. But as soon as he did, the horse began to neigh loudly, kicking its hind legs.

“It seems you and this horse are destined to be together,” the shopkeeper remarked.

Clara nodded in agreement, feeling a connection forming.

“Do you want to install a carriage now?” he asked.

“No, not yet. I’ll wait until it gets better before bringing it back for that,” Clara replied, leading the occasionally wobbly horse out of the market, feeding it some spirit water.

“I can’t tell if I can help you, but I hope this makes you feel better soon,” she said, almost as if the horse could understand her words. It shook its head in response.

“What a beautiful horse!” Shu Yuqin exclaimed as she saw Clara return with the horse.

“But why does it look so limp?” she inquired.

“It’s sick,” Clara answered.

“Have you given it water? It’ll look even better once it recovers,” Shu Yuqin urged.

Clara understood what Shu Yuqin meant by water. “I’ve fed it already.”

Shu Yuqin reached out her hand, wanting to pet the horse, which obligingly leaned closer to her.

“The shopkeeper said it has a stubborn temperament and is hard to train.”

“Stubborn? It seems quite obedient to me,” Shu Yuqin replied.

“I think so too. Maybe it just feels comfortable around us,” Clara agreed.

Shu Xin, watching from the side, felt an urge to touch the horse as well.

“Shu Xin, why don’t you give it a pat? If it doesn’t shy away from you, you can take care of it from now on, okay?”

“Okay, I like it,” Shu Xin said, reaching out to stroke the horse, a satisfied grin on his face.

“I’ll handle the bathing and feeding,” he promised Clara.

“Shu Xin, why don’t you give it a name?” Clara suggested.

“Bai Bai?” he proposed.

“Bai Bai, that’s a lovely name. From now on, it will be called Bai Bai,” Shu Yuqin chimed in.

Clara thought to herself that if the horse could truly understand human speech, it would probably be outraged, given how stubborn it had been back at the market. 

“Alright, Bai Bai it is,” Clara confirmed.

“When Bai Bai is better, I’ll be ready to head south,” Clara said, sitting beside Shu Yuqin.

“Sounds good.”

“In a couple of days, I’ll bring Qing Qing back. Otherwise, you’ll be all alone at home,” Clara added.

“No need, I can manage on my own,” Shu Yuqin replied confidently.

“Still, I’ll go buy a few people to come back with me. I really can’t shake this worry. Why don’t you come with me?” Clara urged.

“I’m not going. If you leave, who will take care of things at home? I’m supposed to be the second master overseeing everything,” Shu Yuqin countered.

“But I really don’t feel at ease with you alone,” Clara insisted, concern etched on her face.

“I can take care of myself now; I’ve learned martial arts,” Shu Yuqin reassured her.

Suddenly, Clara recalled the night when those assassins came for them. 

“No, I’ll leave the place to Yan Xu and Lan Lan. You must come with me,” Clara said firmly.

Seeing Clara’s serious expression, Shu Yuqin’s demeanor shifted to one of concern. 

“What’s wrong? What are you thinking about?” she asked.

“Those people from the main city are trying to kill us,” Clara confessed.

“Alright, I’m scared. I’ll go with you,” Shu Yuqin quickly replied.
