**Letter**

Autumn raised her head to look at Clara, who nodded back at her. 

“What we need to do now is to lift ourselves up and continuously strengthen ourselves so that we might have the chance to take revenge in the future,” Clara said to Autumn with determination.

“But Banxia can’t seem to pick herself up; she’s even thinking about ending her life,” Autumn replied, concern etched on her face.

“Ding! Reward for the host: a selective amnesia pill, which can help someone forget their painful memories.”

“I have a medicine that can help her forget her pain,” Autumn said, suddenly kneeling before Clara. “Please, my lady, grant the medicine to Banxia.”

“But if she forgets, she’ll also forget her enemies,” Clara cautioned.

“It doesn’t matter. I’m her sister; I will remember everything. I just want her to live happily,” Autumn said earnestly.

Clara listened to her words, feeling a warm swell of affection. She didn’t envy Autumn, as she too had sisters she cherished.

The next day, Clara noticed that Banxia’s vivacious personality had returned, and she chattered away with Clara cheerfully.

Banxia was still the same person who loved cooking, so Clara asked Clara if she could take Banxia under her wing. Clara, already thinking along those lines, happily agreed.

Autumn watched her sister return to her old self, and although she was now a servant, she accepted her new life with joy, her lively spirit shining through. She felt grateful to have such a good mistress.

That day, the weather was pleasant, and Clara's family prepared to go out for a picnic. Clara and Banxia made an array of delicious dishes, even preparing an entire lamb for the outing.

Once Yan Xu and Zhang Lanlan arrived, they set off toward the riverbank, not far from the county town. 

Upon reaching their destination, Clara laid out a cloth she had brought, displaying all the delightful food on top. The women gathered around, chatting and laughing together.

Meanwhile, Yan Xu and Shu Xin were busy setting up the barbecue grill. Once the grill was ready, Autumn, Banxia, and the maidservants brought by Zhang Lanlan lit the charcoal fire and placed the lamb on the grill, slathering it with Clara's special sauce, filling the air with a mouthwatering aroma.

As they waited, Clara called Yan Xu and Zhang Lanlan over. “Master, have you decided to leave the day after tomorrow?”

“Yes, everything at home is entrusted to you. Please keep an eye on things for me,” Yan Xu replied.

“Understood. Just be sure to stay safe. If it wasn’t for my mother not wanting me too far from her, I would have gone with you,” Clara said, her voice filled with longing.

“No worries, you can help me a lot from home. As for your wages, we’ll settle that later,” Yan Xu assured her.

“Just let me know where you need help, and I’ll do it without pay,” Clara said playfully.

“Since your junior sister can’t go, having you at home is enough. You’re the one who should be there,” Yan Xu replied.

“Your junior sister is a girl; sometimes it’s not convenient for her to go. Besides, would you really leave Master Yan all alone at home?” 

Yan Xu fell silent; after all, he had come here to accompany his grandfather.

Clara noticed Shu Yuqin and the others gathered around enjoying their food and stood up, deciding to take a stroll by the riverbank. She wore a vibrant green lotus dress, her hair cascading down her shoulders, simply adorned with a wooden hairpin. As she walked, the gentle breeze swayed her skirt, and she twirled happily, thinking about the upcoming opening of her marketplace.

Unbeknownst to her, this charming scene caught the eye of a man on the bridge.

“Master, Master,” a richly dressed man, Ethan Jade, frowned as he turned away from the sight.

“Is the master looking at that woman? She’s just a gold-digger,” a voice nearby dripped with disdain.

“That girl’s not bad; she saved the master and sold us the medicine,” said Ethan’s subordinate, his voice raspy.

“It’s clear that we gave her a lot of money...” 

“Shut up, let’s move,” Ethan commanded, retracting his gaze.

Once the attention on him faded, Clara glanced in the direction they had left, shook her head, and returned to where Shu Yuqin was.

“What’s going on?” Autumn, driving the horse cart home, spotted some people lurking at the door.

“Is this the residence of Miss Clara Joy?” the messenger inquired.

“Yes, it is,” Clara replied.

“Someone asked me to deliver a letter to her.”

Clara hopped off the cart, recognizing the emblem on the letter, her heart racing with excitement. She took out a hundred coins from her pouch and handed them to the messenger. “I am Clara Joy.”

“If you wish to respond, please send someone to me before tomorrow afternoon. I’m staying at the Changlai Inn,” the man explained.

“Ah! It’s from my elder sister!” Clara exclaimed upon returning home.

Shu Yuqin looked at the letter and couldn’t help but shout.

Clara opened the letter, revealing its simple contents:
“Everything is well! I have stabilized my footing and am preparing to start a workshop. The return home date is yet to be determined.”

“Why did she write so little? What about her life? The face masks, the skincare products—have they been made yet? And doesn’t she want to know how we are? Doesn’t she miss us at all?” Shu Yuqin complained, her mouth pouting in frustration.

“Master, there’s more written on the back,” Autumn reminded, noticing Clara had missed it.

Once Clara flipped it over, she read:
“And yes, I miss you!”

“That’s more like it,” Clara said, feeling comforted.

“Honestly, she should be careful about what we can’t see,” Shu Yuqin remarked, feeling slightly better.

Meanwhile, their sister, Shu Qingyan, sat in annoyance, staring down the man beside her.

“Xu Shaozhu, can you stop following me?” she snapped.

“Miss Shu, you don’t need to worry about me; I’m following you to protect you,” Xu Yiyun replied, his tone earnest.

Shu Qingyan rolled her eyes, exasperated. Who would have thought that bumping into him in a crowd would lead to him becoming her shadow?

“We can protect the lady,” chimed in another girl beside Shu Qingyan.

“Then just pretend I’m not here,” Xu Yiyun remarked nonchalantly.

“Miss, perhaps I...” Shu Yi, another man, started to suggest.

“No need,” Shu Qingyan waved her hand dismissively at the siblings she had purchased in Yishi.

Xu Yiyun had indeed helped her significantly; her ability to quickly buy raw materials and start her workshop was largely thanks to him.

“Does Xu Shaozhu have nothing else to do?” she asked pointedly.

Xu Yiyun paused for a moment before replying, “Right now, my biggest task is to win your heart.”

Shu Qingyan took a deep breath. If one were to call him a scoundrel, he certainly behaved with decorum and had yet to cross any boundaries.

“Are you planning to become a scoundrel, Xu Shaozhu?” she teased, raising an eyebrow.

Xu Yiyun shot a glare at the attendant behind him.

“No, I’ve never liked girls before; he’s the one who put these ideas into my head,” he hurriedly explained.

“Master, you can’t blame me! How was I supposed to know that Miss Shu is different from other girls?” the attendant protested.

Ignoring Xu Yiyun, Shu Qingyan simply walked away. Noticing he followed her, she chose not to dwell on it any longer.

Clara carefully stored the letter and, along with Shu Yuqin, began writing responses to Shu Qingyan. Once they finished, they took out some silver coins and handed them to Autumn to deliver to the Changlai Inn.
