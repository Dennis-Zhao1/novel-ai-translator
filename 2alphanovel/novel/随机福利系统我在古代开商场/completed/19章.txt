**Chapter Title: The Old Lady of the Jia Family**

“Honestly, I really didn’t do anything,” Clara Joy said, her face plastered with innocence. She knew she was bound to offend some folks today.

“Village Elder, I’ve brought you some fish from my family’s catch. Please don’t be picky!” Clara said cheerfully as she accepted two skewered fish from her sister, ignoring the curious glances from the villagers around her.

The village elder took the fish, nodding appreciatively. “You’re a kind girl.”

“Elder, I noticed there are many sensible families in our village. We’ve caught quite a bit of fish from the river today, and I think we should share it. Let’s give one fish to each family that wasn’t able to come today. What do you think?” Clara suggested, her voice filled with enthusiasm.

The old village elder studied Clara for a moment, recognizing her cleverness and thoughtfulness. Clara understood that living in the village meant she had to maintain good relationships with others, but today’s events had helped her identify which families were worth her time and which ones were not.

The villagers listening to Clara’s words felt a pang of regret, but as the saying goes, there’s no medicine for regret. In the days to come, they would see those families who weren’t present today thriving, and their remorse would deepen.

Later that afternoon, Clara had to take in everything because her family had made a statement, leaving her no choice. However, she informed those who had caused trouble at her home that she wouldn’t be accepting anything from them in the future. She then delivered a fish to each of the families that hadn’t come, while the rest she entrusted to her friend Li An to sell in town.

Chen Ping picked up the money from selling her hawthorn and chestnuts and rushed to help Clara and her sisters wash up. Since they couldn’t rely solely on the previous day’s meager sales, they needed to produce more.

Noticing that it was getting late, Chen Ping thought it was unlikely anyone else would come to deliver goods. She turned to Clara and said, “You did the right thing today. While it’s important to maintain good relations in the village, not everyone is worth associating with.”

“Ping Ping, why are you defending her? She’s gotten too big for her britches. She offended so many people today without needing my help,” Wang Rong interjected disapprovingly.

“And besides, she didn’t even give a fish to her grandmother’s family,” Wang Rong added.

Realizing why Clara and her sisters looked upset, Chen Ping finally understood the situation. “What can those people do for you? If you offend them, so be it. And for heaven’s sake, don’t forget that Wang’s family has cut ties with you. Why should the children give them anything?” She tugged at Wang Rong’s sleeve, giving her a knowing glance.

Following Chen Ping’s gaze, Wang Rong finally noticed the sisters’ emotional turmoil. “But they are still my parents and brother,” Wang Rong insisted, still unwilling to let go of her ties.

“Mother, let’s just go back to the Wang family,” said Shu Qingyan, voicing the sisters’ feelings.

Wang Rong was left in disbelief; her children didn’t want her anymore. “Second Sister?” she called out to her closest child, Shu Yuqin, after the incident.

“Mother, let’s go. We don’t want a mother who doesn’t care about us. If you have feelings for them, then you should go back!” Yuqin replied firmly.

“To be honest, none of us will ever have anything to do with the Wang family again. We might even consider them our enemies. If you can’t be heartless about it, then we’ll manage ourselves,” Clara added, her words heavy with finality.

The sisters had initially thought Wang Rong was ready to mend their relationship, but it became clear that she still saw her ties to the Wang family as a bond, despite the severance.

Feeling lost, Wang Rong stepped outside, contemplating a visit back to the Wang household. 

“If you want to go back, then go. But just know, the children’s hearts will never heal,” Chen Ping warned as she accompanied her out, her tone laced with frustration.

Clara and her sisters ignored Wang Rong, each focused on their own tasks. It wasn’t until around the hour of the pig that Wang Rong returned, her eyes brimming with tears.

She hoped to find comfort from Clara and her sisters, but they pretended not to notice her entrance. Clara thought, *If you come back, we’ll support you, but we won’t be close anymore. You won’t know anything about our lives from now on.*

After selling hawthorn and chestnuts for a while, Clara’s earnings were impressive. With no special circumstances, they could earn over nine hundred coins a day after expenses.

During this time, Clara also visited the Yan family twice to check on Elder Yan. After two more acupuncture sessions and medication, she noticed a significant improvement in his facial droop and his ability to speak more clearly.

Feeling the chill of Clara and her sisters’ coldness, Wang Rong tried to change, attempting various ways to show care for them each day.

One day, while Clara and Shu Yuqin were selling their goods, they spotted the old lady Jia across the street.

“Madam, those are two of the three girls I mentioned last time,” Jia Pozi reported.

The old lady Jia’s expression remained unchanged, but her grip on Jia Pozi’s arm tightened noticeably.

“They are the ones who ruined my son’s chances of marrying; they deserve to be buried together,” she hissed.

Jia Pozi understood that her mistress was taking out her frustrations on the girls.

“Madam, do you want to go over?” she asked cautiously.

“Let’s go see. I want to find out what kind of people the King of Hell wouldn’t take, yet they were lucky enough to be saved,” the old lady Jia said, lifting her chin defiantly.

“Madam, may I interest you in some chestnuts and hawthorn?” Clara asked politely, her smile unwavering.

“You know me?” the old lady Jia retorted, surprise flickering across her face.

“I’ve seen Lady Jia before,” Clara replied, her inner thoughts not so kind, *so I know you’re just a heartless old hag.*

“You wouldn’t have to suffer if you were smart enough to join my son in living a life of luxury,” the old lady Jia said with a patronizing tone.

Clara was taken aback by her bluntness. The old lady didn’t know that it was actually Yan Xiaogong who saved them, and she was referring to the first time they had ‘come back from the dead.’

However, Clara couldn’t fathom that the old lady harbored such deep-seated resentment towards them for reasons beyond their control.

With a forced smile, Clara replied, “It’s not our fault that the King of Hell wouldn’t take us. There’s nothing we can do about it.”

“Hmph, sharp-tongued!” 

Clara was stunned. *I simply stated the truth; how is that being sharp-tongued?*

“Two girls out and about, how shameless can you be?” the old lady Jia spat suddenly.

“Why do you look down on women, Madam? We’re just like most women on this street, trying to make a living. What’s so shameful about it?” Clara replied loudly, drawing the attention of many passersby.

“Isn’t that Lady Jia? I thought she was the kindest person, yet here she is saying such things. We women have no choice but to go out and do business!” some women selling goods chimed in.

“Oh dear, how did you hear that? Our old lady was just concerned about how tired you girls must be from selling. She wanted to help you buy some things!” Jia Pozi quickly interjected, realizing the old lady’s reputation was at stake.

“Oh, is that so? I must have misheard. My apologies, Madam,” Clara feigned confusion.

“Hmm, it’s alright. Just make sure not to wrongly accuse anyone next time. Here’s five taels of silver; that should be enough to cover what I need,” the old lady Jia said, her tone condescendingly generous.
