Assassination

Since they were in the wilderness, Autumn and Bansha took turns keeping watch at night, while they replenished their sleep during the day. 

"Master, there are people up ahead. Do you think they could be the ones who raided the weapons from Tianfeng Village?" 

Not far from Clara and the others, a group of people had set up camp right where they stood. Clara Joy sensed their presence and alerted Autumn and Bansha to stay vigilant. She was on high alert, but after a while, when nothing happened, Clara relaxed her guard a bit, allowing Shuyuqin to sleep first. As for Shuxin, she found a nearby tree to rest against.

The night passed without incident, though Clara only pretended to sleep in the latter half of the night. When the horse cart began to move the next morning, and those people hadn’t followed them, Clara's sleepiness finally began to fade.

In the following three days, Clara and her group faced no other issues and spent almost all their time on the road, except at night. 

"We should try to reach Liuyan County before nightfall," Clara remarked as she examined the map in her hands.

"If nothing goes wrong, we should be able to make it," Shuyuqin replied from beside her.

"But if we don’t, we’ll have to spend the night in the woods," Clara said with a hint of concern.

It seemed Clara's luck had run out this time. After traveling a while, it began to rain. At first, Shuxin insisted on continuing through the rain, but the horse soon threw a fit. Concerned for Shuxin, Clara had no choice but to stop in the forest.

Ignoring Shuxin's stubbornness, Clara called her into the cart. "Looks like we'll have to spend the day in the cart."

The rain fell harder, and the sky grew darker. 

"System detecting danger," a sudden voice interrupted Clara's preparations for departure.

Clara immediately put down the card in her hand. "Everyone, stay alert. Tonight might not be peaceful."

Shuyuqin glanced at Clara, who nodded in affirmation. Shuyuqin's expression turned even more serious, and she periodically lifted the curtain to peek outside.

Seeing Clara and Shuyuqin tense, Autumn and Bansha also focused intently on their surroundings but felt nothing amiss. 

That shouldn't be— their martial arts skills were on par with Clara's; it was impossible for Clara to sense danger while they couldn’t pick up on anything at all. 

Clara noticed their unease and explained, "I just have a stronger intuition for danger."

"Let's keep working on the cart. I can't just sit here waiting; it’s too uncomfortable," Shuyuqin took a deep breath.

Yet Clara couldn’t focus on that. The system's constant reminders signified that they were likely outnumbered. With only a handful of them, waiting was their only option.

"I'll drive the cart. We need to move forward," Clara declared, not giving the others a chance to respond before stepping outside.

No matter how hard Clara urged the horse, it refused to budge, remaining rooted in place.

Something felt off. Clara contained her anxious thoughts and settled her mind. 

Sure enough, she detected a different scent in the air. It seemed they had walked right into someone else's trap since they set off that morning. 

But who were these people? The Tianfeng Village or perhaps someone from the Capital?

Taking out a bottle of spirit water from her storage bag, Clara fed it to the horse. Moments later, the horse finally agreed to move forward.

But just then, a group of people in black suddenly leaped out from the trees on either side. 

Seeing them, Clara knew at once they were from the Capital. 

Without a word, the black-clad figures charged straight for Clara's cart. 

As Shuyuqin and the others spotted the attackers, they immediately jumped down from the cart. 

The few of them formed a defensive circle, backs pressed together, their faces serious and determined. 

A battle was about to erupt. Clara lashed out with her whip at the nearest assailant. 

But the attacker dodged, making Clara's heart sink deeper. They were outnumbered, and each enemy was skilled, matching her own capabilities. 

It felt like this would be a hopeless fight. 

Clara gritted her teeth and held her ground, catching sight of one person preparing to strike at Shuyuqin while she was engaged with another. 

"Watch out!" Clara shouted, her eyes blazing with urgency as she lunged forward.

Fortunately, she was quick enough; the sword struck her shoulder, but Shuyuqin managed to fend off her assailant. 

"Are you okay?" 

"I'm fine." 

Clara ignored the wound on her shoulder and continued to fight against the black-clad attackers. 

But outnumbered, despite their best efforts, Clara and her companions were overwhelmed, each sustaining injuries. 

Could it be that they were destined to die here today? 

Half-kneeling on the ground, Clara stared at the advancing enemies, feeling despair.

In a critical moment, she heard the sound of horses whinnying behind her. 

Suddenly, a group charged in, clashing with the black-clad figures, giving Clara and her companions a brief respite. 

She pulled out the spirit water and handed it to the others. 

Shuyuqin and Shuxin recognized it and drank it down eagerly, while Autumn and Bansha joined in as well. 

Once they had regained some strength, they rejoined the fray, and Clara recognized their unexpected allies. 

It was the man she had saved from the ruined temple, along with his subordinates. 

Just as the black-clad figures were near defeat, another wave surged out of the forest. 

Clearly, someone from the Capital was furious and determined to see them dead this time. 

"You all need to leave! There are too many of them!" Clara shouted urgently to Ethan Jade, who had rushed to her side. 

Ethan frowned, bewildered that she would say such a thing at this moment. 

"They're after us; they won’t involve you." 

Hearing those words, Ethan hesitated but then whistled sharply. 

More people surged into the clearing from various directions. 

"Deal with them," Ethan commanded, stepping back from the fight and directing the newcomers. 

This time, Clara and her group finally gained the upper hand and quickly subdued their attackers. 

Spotting some captives among the black-clad figures, Clara wasted no time in dispatching them. 

Once they confirmed all the enemies were dead, Clara finally allowed herself to relax a little. 

"Thank you for saving us, Young Master," Clara said, her voice barely audible as she felt her strength fading. 

But before Ethan could respond, Clara collapsed onto the ground. 

Shuyuqin panicked and rushed over, attempting to lift Clara, but she was injured herself and lacked the strength. 

"Ethan, go fetch her cart!" Ethan approached Shuyuqin and, after a moment's hesitation, lifted Clara in his arms, heading toward her cart. 

Shuyuqin and the others quickly returned to the cart as well. 

When Clara finally opened her eyes again, she found herself lying on a bed, with Shuyuqin sitting by her side. 

"You’re awake?"
