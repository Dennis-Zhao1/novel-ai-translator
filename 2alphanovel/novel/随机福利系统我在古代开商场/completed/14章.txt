**A Debt of Gratitude**

“What’s this?” Wang Rong asked, eyeing the herb in Clara Joy’s hand, a peculiar expression on her face.

“It's a Chinese herb called He Shou Wu, Mom. Could you please go ask Uncle Li to borrow the village chief’s ox cart? I need to head to town,” Clara replied, glancing at the sky to gauge the time. It wasn’t too late yet.

With the money she would make, they could finally sell the hawthorn candy and roasted chestnuts the next day. Clara had a strong appreciation for money from her past life experiences, and not having any cash on hand felt incredibly uncomfortable.

Wang Rong sensed a growing distance between herself and her children. Except for Er Ni, Da Ni and San Ni were no longer as close to her as before, which made her heart ache.

Li An, without hesitation, grabbed Clara’s hand and led her towards the most reputable clinic in town.

**Qing An Clinic.**

Although it was already past mid-afternoon, the clinic was bustling with patients. A young apprentice was deftly sorting through various herbs.

Dr. Hu Shun, who had just finished examining a patient, glanced toward the door while handing a prescription to the apprentice. What he saw caught him off guard.

A frail girl was standing there, a large bundle slung over her shoulder, her eyes darting around like she was a bandit descending from the mountains.

But upon closer inspection, he realized that the bundle was actually He Shou Wu!

“Wait a moment, everyone!” Dr. Hu called out to the patients in front of him.

Clara stood at the entrance, scanning the busy clinic. She had no idea whom to approach to sell her herbs and was just about to leave when—

“Miss, please wait!” Dr. Hu shouted, disregarding his image as he rushed toward her.

Clara turned, puzzled, unsure if he was calling her.

Dr. Hu had already reached her side, his demeanor warm and inviting. “You’re here to sell herbs, aren’t you?”

Clara nodded, recognizing him as the doctor who had just treated a patient. He seemed capable and trustworthy.

“Please, come inside,” Dr. Hu said politely.

“After you,” Clara replied, feeling a sense of respect for doctors like him.

Dr. Hu led Clara into the clinic’s backyard. Li An was waiting by the ox cart at the entrance. Seeing Clara being welcomed inside, he felt reassured; the doctors at Qing An Clinic were all kind-hearted.

He couldn’t help but wonder how precious Clara’s He Shou Wu really was that Dr. Hu himself had come out to greet her and invite her to the backyard. Usually, when someone came to sell herbs, they would simply call the apprentice over to weigh them.

Clara emerged from the clinic with a beaming smile, her hands now holding over fifty taels of silver.

“Should we head straight home?” Li An asked.

“Let’s buy some wrapping paper, weigh out a few pounds of sugar, and pick up some meat before heading back,” Clara replied.

On their way, Clara noticed a bookstore and asked Li An to stop the cart.

“What do you need from the bookstore?” Li An queried, his brow furrowed in confusion.

Clara smiled but said nothing. She had been pondering how to repay Chen Ping and Li An for their kindness, and the sight of the bookstore sparked an idea.

Li An had only one son, Li Hongshun, who studied in town and had a day off every six days, though he might get extra time off during busy farming seasons. Since Li Hongshun was a diligent student, Clara decided to buy him a stack of paper and a brush as a way to express her gratitude.

After purchasing the other items, Clara returned to the butcher who had sold her pork the previous day. This time, she bought a larger quantity, and the owner graciously gifted her a pig’s foot. Clara couldn’t help but compliment the butcher, making him beam with joy, and he even tossed in a couple of bones for her.

When Clara got home, Chen Ping brought over some fresh vegetables. Clara asked Li An to wait for her so they could return the cart to the village chief’s house together. She had intentionally brought along about two pounds of meat as a token of appreciation.

By now, thanks to Song Qingqing’s chatter, word had spread throughout the village that Clara’s family had found a way to sell herbs for money. Villagers they encountered on the road would ask her questions.

Clara openly acknowledged the gossip, which helped assuage any concerns about their sudden wealth. After all, her family was all women, and it would be easy for rumors to fly if they suddenly had money to spend.

“Take the meat back. We’re all from the same village,” Yang, the village chief’s daughter-in-law, insisted.

“Grandma Yang, this isn’t just a thank-you for the cart. It’s also for the village chief’s hard work helping us with the land contract. Please accept it,” Clara insisted firmly.

“Let’s talk about something else, shall we?” Clara said, placing the meat on the stove and changing the subject.

“What is it? Just say it,” Yang encouraged.

“My sisters and I want to prepare two types of food and need to go to town or the county to buy supplies. We’d like to rent the ox cart for that. Would thirty wen a day be okay?” Clara proposed.

“That works, but let’s lower it to twenty wen. We still have another ox for plowing, so it’s more than enough,” Yang agreed.

“Thank you so much, Grandma Yang! You’re too kind. Don’t worry; we’ll treat the ox well and make sure it’s well-fed before returning it,” Clara replied happily, sealing the deal before stepping outside to find Li An still waiting by the door.

“Uncle Li, why didn’t you leave first?” she asked.

“No rush; it hasn’t been long,” Li An replied casually. Clara had already informed Chen Ping and Li An that they would be having dinner at her place that evening.

After dinner, Clara brought out the gifts for Chen Ping’s family: a pound of sugar, two pounds of pork, and the supplies for Li Hongshun.

“I can’t accept this. You and your mother are like sisters to me,” Chen Ping protested.

“I know Aunt Ping’s heart. To me, you’re like family, and that’s why you should accept this. I sold some herbs today and wanted to honor you with this. If you refuse, it would feel like we’re growing distant,” Clara explained earnestly.

“See? I told you that San Ni has changed a lot. She never used to have such a sharp tongue,” Chen Ping remarked, glancing at Wang Rong and Li An.

Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin sat in a corner, hoping not to be the next subjects of discussion.

But as fate would have it, Chen Ping’s gaze landed on them, and she said, “Rong Er, I have to say, all three children have changed a great deal since the events of the past few days. Da Ni was always the most outgoing, and San Ni the shyest, but now it seems they’ve switched roles. And Er Ni, who used to avoid you, now clings to you.”

Wang Rong’s heart sank deeper as she looked over her children, feeling guilty for their struggles.

“It’s all my fault as their mother; they’ve had to endure so much because of me, and that’s why they’ve changed,” she lamented.

“I told you to move out sooner. But at least now that you’ve moved, things are looking up. Just look at how lucky you’ve been since leaving. San Ni even found that precious herb!” 

“Yes, things are definitely better now,” Wang Rong smiled, but Clara sensed a lingering sadness in her mother’s brow.

Chen Ping, aware of Wang Rong’s pain, scolded herself for bringing up sensitive topics. She turned and affectionately ruffled Clara’s hair.

“Well, since it’s the children’s way of showing respect, I’ll accept it,” she finally conceded.

With that, she followed Li An out, muttering to herself about how she shouldn’t have mentioned those things earlier.
