**A Qing**

The next day, Clara Joy took Zhang Guangming and continued to stroll through the streets. As they passed various shops selling all sorts of goods, Clara felt the urge to explore a bit more. Eventually, she decided to negotiate with the shop that sold beef jerky yesterday. With that in mind, she led Zhang Guangming back to the store.

Zhang Guangming understood Clara's intentions and stepped inside to discuss matters with the shopkeeper. "Clara, let’s wait here for a moment while the shopkeeper goes to find his boss," he said after a brief conversation. He walked back to Clara, who had looked up at him just as the shopkeeper gave her a slight nod.

During their wait, a perceptive staff member escorted them upstairs and served tea. 

"Uncle Zhang, are you planning to keep running around like this?" Clara asked, curiosity evident in her voice.

"Well, yes. After all, one has to earn a living. This way, I can make more money," Zhang Guangming replied with a hint of pride.

They chatted casually, and Clara learned that he had a set of young twins at home. 

Just as Clara took a sip of her tea, a knock echoed from the door. Qiu Sang opened it to reveal a middle-aged man who exuded an air of integrity.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, they transitioned into serious discussions. Clara expressed her intentions to purchase various items. The shopkeeper listened in shock; Clara was essentially looking to buy everything in the store and establish a long-term order. However, he faced a dilemma similar to the one with Chen Zihao, as certain products like beef were difficult to preserve. Clara had her methods, but she couldn't disclose them directly to the shopkeeper.

She had signed an agreement with Chen's family, which restricted her from sharing the ice-making technique with anyone else. Because of this preservation issue, the negotiations were temporarily put on hold. 

Feeling deflated, Clara stepped out of the shop, realizing she had been so eager to make money that she hadn’t considered all aspects. Yet, she was reluctant to give up on the beef order; its potential was too great.

"Girl, do you have time tomorrow?" Zhang Guangming suddenly asked.

"What’s up, Uncle?" Clara replied, intrigued.

"My wife wants to invite you over for dinner," he explained.

Clara felt a bit puzzled, her eyes reflecting her confusion as she looked at Zhang Guangming.

"My wife is quite hospitable; every time someone I know comes over, she insists on preparing a feast. She always asks me to invite them over for a meal," he continued.

After a moment of hesitation, Clara agreed, thinking it might be good to take her mind off things for a while.

The following day, Clara and her family gathered gifts before heading back to Nanyanguo with Zhang Guangming to visit his home. 

"Come in, come in! Make yourselves comfortable," Zhang Guangming's wife, A Qing, welcomed them warmly. 

Zhang Guangming's house was a traditional two-entry courtyard, and several servants bustled about. As Clara and her party dismounted from the carriage, a woman hurried over to greet them.

"This must be Clara!" A Qing exclaimed, pulling Clara into a friendly embrace. "I've heard so much about you from Uncle Zhang. He says you’re a remarkably ambitious young woman destined for great things!"

"Oh, Uncle Zhang is exaggerating; I’m just doing some small business," Clara laughed modestly.

"Child, this is no small business! Once your market opens..." Zhang Guangming started to say, but was interrupted by A Qing.

"This is Miss Shu Er, and the young master? They’re both wonderful, such good-looking children!" A Qing then turned her attention to Clara’s sister, Shu Yuqin, who stood beside her.

"Apologies for intruding, madam," Clara said, trying to be polite.

"Oh, you’re not intruding at all! Just call me Aunt Qing," A Qing replied.

"Sure thing, Aunt Qing," Clara responded, smiling.

"Alright, let’s stop standing at the door and sit inside to chat," A Qing suggested, waving to a servant to take their carriage away. 

Since they had come from Changyuan, they had already eaten their lunch on the carriage. Now it was well past noon, and A Qing invited them for dinner.

Clara noticed Zhang Guangming's twins, just three years old and irresistibly adorable, calling her and Shu Yuqin "Sister" with their sweet, chubby faces. Clara couldn't help but be enchanted by the pair, alternating between hugging one and then the other.

Meanwhile, A Qing was bustling around with the cook in the kitchen. Clara caught a glimpse of their main dish for the evening—roast lamb.

"I’m not sure if you’re used to eating beef, but hot pot with it is incredibly delicious," A Qing mentioned, knowing that in Nanyanguo, cattle were not killed indiscriminately. She thought Clara and her party might not have tried beef before.

"We're quite accustomed to it," Clara assured her.

"That's great! Then tonight we’ll have beef hot pot!" A Qing beamed.

Clara watched as one of the twins nestled in her arms while observing the cook prepare the dish, realizing that the hot pot resembled a clear broth-style fondue.

During dinner, there were no distinctions between master and servant; typically, the men would gather at one table while the women would sit at another. A Qing was concerned that Clara and her sisters might mind this arrangement, but after confirming they didn’t, she became even more personable with them.

"Even though they’re individuals we’ve bought, they’re still people. They can help me with work but can also share a meal with us," A Qing said with a smile.

Clara agreed, understanding the sentiment, especially since they had all transitioned into this new world.

The women’s table finished eating quite early, and Clara and her sisters took the opportunity to play and chat with the twins. Meanwhile, the men continued drinking at their table, their faces flushed but full of joy.

As Clara engaged in small talk with A Qing, she noticed her glancing toward Zhang Guangming with a hint of sadness in her demeanor. 

"Aunt Qing, are you alright?" Clara asked, concerned.

"I just wish their father could be home more often. Look how happy the twins are today," A Qing replied, a wistful smile on her lips.

"Aunt Qing, Uncle Zhang is out working for your better life," Clara reassured.

A Qing turned to Clara, smiling faintly. "I know he does it for our sake, but I miss having him around. Sometimes, when he’s away for too long, the twins don’t even recognize him."

Clara could imagine A Qing’s feelings of longing and concern, missing her husband. After returning from Changyuan, she had heard Zhang Guangming mention he would leave again after they departed.

"Third sister, you hadn’t considered how to transport the beef. That requires someone trustworthy—like Uncle Zhang," Shu Yuqin suddenly chimed in with a playful wink.

Clara's mind clicked into gear. Yes! She could hire Zhang Guangming to handle the logistics, signing a confidentiality agreement to give him full responsibility here. She could even share the ice-making method with him, allowing him to hire people for transportation.

This way, she wouldn’t be violating her agreement with the Chen family, as it would still be for her own use, keeping it under wraps. Plus, it would only be utilized for transport and wouldn’t compete with Chen’s ice business. 

"Second sister, you're brilliant!" Clara exclaimed, elated.

A Qing, puzzled by their conversation, leaned in for an explanation. Clara clarified the plan, and soon A Qing was beaming with delight.
