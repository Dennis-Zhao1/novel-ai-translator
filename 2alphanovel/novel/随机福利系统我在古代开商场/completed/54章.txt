**Becoming a Thief**

Clara Joy and her companions found themselves with nowhere else to go, so they settled in a forest just outside the county, munching on the provisions that Clara’s sister, Sophie, and Banxia had prepared the day before.

After finishing their meal, Clara Joy leaned closer to Sophie and shared her plan. “The system rewarded me with an invisibility pill. I’m going to raid Tianfeng Village.”

Sophie’s eyes widened with excitement, and she nearly squealed, quickly covering her mouth to stifle her enthusiasm. “Do you have an extra one? I want to go too!” she whispered eagerly.

“Just one,” Clara replied, her tone slightly apologetic.

“Fine, just make it quick! Take everything you can from them!” Sophie huffed, her frustration evident. They had heard plenty about Tianfeng Village while looking for an inn, and the stories were brutal. The villagers were known for their cruelty, abducting women and robbing travelers. Anyone who dared to resist was killed without a second thought.

It was infuriating that the county magistrate turned a blind eye to their actions, even colluding with the bandits, which left the local populace in utter despair.

Clara also learned that the strongest fighters in the village weren’t the third-in-command but rather the rarely seen leader and his two strategists. 

“You all stay here with my sister while I go out,” Clara instructed confidently.

“I want to go too!” Sophie’s brother, Shuxin, chimed in quickly.

Autumn, who had been quietly observing, also showed a desire to join.

“I’m not doing anything dangerous! You guys can just wait for me here,” Clara waved them off.

With that, she used her lightness skill to slip away. Sophie quickly stopped Shuxin, who was about to follow. “Shuxin, don’t worry! Clara won’t run into any danger!”

Feeling left out, Shuxin looked disappointed but eventually nodded in agreement.

Clara made her way to a vantage point where she could see Tianfeng Village. She paused, considering the fact that the third-in-command’s martial arts matched her own, while the leader and the two strategists were even stronger. She knew that if she went any closer, she risked being discovered.

“Host, the invisibility pill lasts for only two hours, so you need to hurry. Otherwise, you could get caught,” a voice from her system reminded her.

After observing for a while from her perch in the trees, Clara finally swallowed the invisibility pill. 

She jumped down and approached the village gate, where two watchtowers flanked either side, with guards on duty. Clara pushed the gate open and walked straight inside.

The guards heard the noise and exchanged puzzled looks. They could see no one; how could the gate have swung open?

They descended from the towers and found the door ajar, but the area around them was empty. 

“Could it be the wind?” one of them speculated.

“What wind? Did you feel any?” another retorted.

“No.”

“Then it can’t be the wind, can it?”

“Then what was it? There’s no one here.”

“Is it a ghost?”

“Don’t be ridiculous.”

“Keep your voice down! The leader doesn’t believe in that nonsense. We’ll get punished if he hears us.”

Clara glanced back at the confused guards, a mischievous grin creeping onto her face. 

She then leaped onto the rooftops, lifting tiles one by one in search of the storeroom. However, before she could find it, she was spotted by three people inside one of the rooms.

“Who goes there?”

One of the three leaped onto the roof, scanning the area cautiously. 

Clara held her breath, terrified to make a sound as she watched the man search nearby. After what felt like an eternity, he finally descended back into the room.

“Let’s check the storeroom to see if anything is missing,” he ordered.

Clara quietly crawled to the edge of the roof, listening as the man instructed another, “Forget it; I’ll go myself.”

Rather than following immediately, Clara stayed back, watching carefully. Only when the man returned did she leap down.

The clever bandits had hidden the storeroom in the most dilapidated building. Clara hadn’t even considered that run-down shack during her search. 

Moreover, there were no bamboo spikes on the walls of that crumbling structure. Clara climbed inside, and before she knew it, she accidentally triggered a trap that sent a barrage of arrows flying toward her.

Caught off guard, Clara scrambled to defend herself. 

The commotion naturally drew the attention of the villagers, who rushed toward the noise. Clara pulled out her whip, using it to deflect the arrows as she dashed into the building. 

Inside, however, she found it completely empty.

“Have I been tricked?” Clara thought in dismay.

“Host, keep moving forward. There’s something good ahead,” the system’s voice piped up again.

Clara sensed that footsteps were nearing, so she hurried onward, hoping to find a hidden room. Her hands flew over the walls, searching for a switch.

Just as the door swung open, Clara discovered the mechanism to a hidden door; she slipped inside just as the guards entered.

Once inside, Clara was greeted with the sight of numerous treasure chests. Without a moment to lose, she began shoving everything into her storage pouch.

When someone opened the door, Clara seized the opportunity to slip out from the side and nimbly scale the rooftop to escape.

Without pausing for breath, Clara sprinted back toward the direction where Sophie and the others were waiting. Along the way, she spotted the man she'd previously saved, lurking at a distance from the village.

“Antidote,” Clara said to her system as she approached her hiding spot.

“No antidote available,” it replied flatly.

Sighing, Clara settled onto a tree branch to wait for the effects of the invisibility pill to wear off. She also took a moment to examine her haul.

Aside from a substantial sum of silver—ten thousand taels—most of what she had pilfered were weapons. 

Looking at the weapons reminded Clara of the conversation she had overheard between the three men who had spotted her earlier. They were certainly ambitious...

“You’re back?” Sophie exclaimed as she rushed over, a fire crackling nearby.

“How did it go? How much did you get?” 

“I couldn’t find the storeroom where they kept the money, but I did get ten thousand taels of silver,” Clara replied, trying to keep her tone light.

Sophie pouted, clearly disappointed. “So they got off easy?”

Clara shook her head, “I disagree. Taking their weapons is likely a bigger blow to them than money.”

As she had suspected, chaos reigned in Tianfeng Village at that moment. The leader and his two strategists were throwing fits, barking orders in frustration.

They had searched the entire village and found no trace of the thief, yet all their weapons had vanished right from under their noses!

“Who could have done this?” one of them shouted in disbelief.

The guards at the gate exchanged glances, suspecting a connection to the mysterious opening of the gate, but no one dared to speak of it.

Suddenly, a figure appeared outside the village, prompting the guards to ring the alarm.

The villagers instantly went on high alert. But because their opponents were highly skilled and their weapons were missing, Tianfeng Village soon fell under siege.

“Didn’t they say Tianfeng Village is hard to breach, with advanced weapons? How could they be so weak?” Ethan Jade, the leader of their group, commented dryly.

“Were our weapons not stolen by you?” the village’s second-in-command challenged, still in disbelief.

“Why would we resort to such underhanded tactics?” Ethan replied coolly.

“Enough chatter. Move out!” Ethan commanded, his expression icy.

Thus, Tianfeng Village faded into obscurity.

Ethan interrogated the leader of Tianfeng Village, only to learn that before they attacked, someone had snuck in and stolen their weapons right under their noses. That was how they had managed to take the village so easily.

Clara, blissfully unaware of these events, was simply thrilled with her unexpected windfall of ten thousand taels that would replenish her nearly depleted resources.
