**Hot Pot Base**

On the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, fearing they wouldn’t be able to manage the rush, the family decided to go together. By the time they arrived in the county, a crowd was already gathered in front of their stall, eagerly waiting for them.

As soon as Clara Joy and the others showed up, the crowd surged forward.

Before noon even arrived, they had sold out all the mooncakes they brought with them.

Clara Joy noticed that there was still an hour until lunchtime. Since they were planning to go to the Yan family’s house anyway, she figured it would be best to head over early and return sooner. So, she instructed Shu Qingyan to take Shu Yuqin and Wang Rong to explore the county on their own and then meet her in front of the Fu'an Restaurant later.

As for Li An, after dropping them off in the morning, Clara Joy had sent him back home.

“You're here!” Clara Joy had just reached the entrance of the Yan family’s residence when she bumped into the butler, who was stepping out.

With a bright smile, she greeted him.

“Old Master and Young Master are chatting in the garden!” 

After the butler led Clara Joy inside, he called over a little maid to relay a message.

“Grandfather, I really can’t pursue an official career. Why do my parents keep insisting that I focus on my studies?” Young Master Yan Xu pouted slightly.

“What would you like to do then?” Old Master Yan inquired, his speech nearly as fluid as any regular person’s.

“Well, anything but an official career,” Yan Xu replied with a hint of defiance.

“Don’t think I don’t know you. You want to go into business,” Old Master Yan said with a hint of pride.

“Old Master, Young Master, Miss Shu San has arrived!” 

“You’re here! Come, sit!” Yan Xu looked up at Clara Joy, his face lighting up.

“It's the Mid-Autumn Festival today, and I must trouble you to help this old man with his ailments,” Old Master Yan said amiably.

Clara Joy accepted the tea that Yan Xu handed her.

“It’s no trouble at all. I should thank Grandfather Yan for helping spread the word yesterday; I sold out so quickly today.”

“It’s because you’re clever. Even without me, you would have found a way to sell those mooncakes,” Old Master Yan asserted confidently.

“Don’t you want to go into business? Can you think of a way to sell your goods like Clara Joy does?” Old Master Yan turned to Yan Xu, his expression filled with mild disdain.

After hearing about Clara Joy’s method of selling mooncakes last night, Yan Xu felt intrigued.

“I… I just don’t want to study anymore,” Yan Xu stammered, taken aback.

Clara Joy, sensing the awkwardness hanging in the air, quickly stood up. 

“I’ll start with acupuncture for Grandfather Yan now.”

With practiced ease, she used silver needles to perform acupuncture on Old Master Yan. Yan Xu no longer kept a doctor on standby; he held Clara Joy’s medical skills in high regard.

During the acupuncture session, Clara Joy wrote out a prescription for Old Master Yan and handed it to the butler, then settled back down with Yan Xu to chat in the courtyard.

“How do you come up with so many tricks for selling things? First it was chestnuts, now mooncakes,” Clara Joy remarked.

Clara Joy suddenly found herself at a loss for words. Many of her ideas were borrowed from business methods she remembered from her past life.

“Selling chestnuts tapped into the customers' herd mentality. As for the mooncakes, I initially planned to attract people with the talents of talented scholars, and then offer samples. Those who tasted would surely be willing to buy, but in the end, it turned out to be the celebrity effect,” she explained.

“How can you be so sure people will buy after tasting?” Yan Xu asked, his curiosity piqued.

“The food from my family is delicious. Who could resist once they've had a taste?” 

His response left Yan Xu momentarily speechless. The mooncakes from Clara Joy's family were indeed the best he’d ever tasted. Even he, who generally disliked sweets, found himself wanting more.

However, Clara Joy’s words sparked a thought in Yan Xu’s mind.

He genuinely wanted to go into business, but his father always said that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants ranked the merchant class as the lowest. As a result, he rarely interacted with merchants and had just realized that even something as simple as selling goods involved clever strategies.

After a while, Clara Joy removed the needles from Old Master Yan.

“Grandfather Yan is all better now! I’ve prescribed a few doses of medicine to help maintain the effects,” Clara Joy said cheerfully.

“Thank you! I’m really grateful to have you here,” Old Master Yan replied.

After leaving the Yan residence, Clara Joy went to the Fu'an Restaurant to meet up with her family.

Once they were all together inside the restaurant, they ordered several dishes to enjoy.

This made Wang Rong feel a pinch in her heart; their meal cost several hundred coins.

For the next few days, Clara Joy and her family completely relaxed. They initially thought that after such intense busyness, they would feel exhausted when things suddenly came to a halt. However, none of them felt tired at all.

Clara Joy figured it had to do with the spirit water they had been consuming.

By the fifth day, Clara Joy still hadn’t thought of what to do next, let alone the other three, who naturally had fewer ideas.

Clara Joy kept tugging at her hair in frustration, feeling as if her mind was muddled; she couldn’t seem to come up with anything.

“Oh no, it’s getting colder! I need to go gather some firewood from the mountains,” Wang Rong said as she entered, carrying a load of firewood alongside Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin.

“Still pondering? Don’t overthink it; just take your time,” Shu Yuqin advised.

“No way! We’re going to be the richest people in Nanyan Kingdom!” Clara Joy firmly rejected the notion of slacking off.

“Ah, right, right! I can’t let myself relax like this. I have to become rich!” Shu Yuqin exclaimed, slapping her forehead.

“Let’s brainstorm together and think of everything we can from our past lives to see which ideas we can implement now,” Shu Qingyan suggested softly after Wang Rong headed to the kitchen.

“This morning, I counted the money, and we have a total of over one hundred thirty-five taels. I’m not sure if that’s enough to build a brick house.”

“That should be enough for a basic one, right?” Shu Yuqin said uncertainly.

*Ding! Reward: One thousand pounds of hot pot base, recipe included.*

“Master, would you like to transfer it directly to your storage pouch?”

“Transfer.”

Clara Joy suddenly slapped her thigh, startling the two beside her.

“It’s getting cold! How did I not think of hot pot?” she exclaimed.

“Where did that come from?” 

“I just got a reward of one thousand pounds of hot pot base, and it comes with a recipe!” Clara Joy grinned.

“Even with our current money, it might not be enough to open a hot pot restaurant,” Shu Qingyan said with a furrowed brow.

With the hot pot base in mind, Clara Joy quickly began brainstorming other foods they could make that would be suitable for now.

“How about we sell skewers? We can buy a few stoves and cook them in the county. The smell will definitely attract a lot of people. Plus, hot pot skewers have a spicy and fragrant flavor; it’s perfect for the colder weather,” Clara Joy excitedly shared her idea.

“Sounds good! I’m craving it already,” Shu Yuqin said, licking her lips.

“Great, then we can ask Uncle Li to chop some bamboo for us to make bamboo tubes. When customers buy them, we can serve them in the tubes,” Shu Qingyan suggested.

“But once we run out of that one thousand pounds of hot pot base, we’ll need to make our own.”

“With the recipe, I can handle that. While beef tallow is hard to come by, I can use vegetable oil instead, so it won’t be too greasy in the winter,” Shu Yuqin replied.

“Perfect! Since we have some time, you can start making it in a few days. Our storage pouch can keep it fresh, so it won’t spoil,” Clara Joy assured her.

Shu Yuqin nodded in agreement.

In the end, they decided to buy three large clay pots and customize three big stoves to create three different flavors.
