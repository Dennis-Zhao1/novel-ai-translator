First Encounter with Chen Zihao

"Sister San, who do you think will come looking for us?" Shu Yuqin asked, intrigued by her sister Clara Joy's words.

"Erjie, in this town, we have the Xue family and the Chen family. With the way the Xue family is acting, the chance of us choosing them is nearly zero. But if the Chen family steps in to help us resolve our current troubles, we would definitely be grateful," Clara Joy patiently explained to Shu Yuqin.

"Oh, so the Chen family will surely come to help us, and once we’re grateful, we’ll feel inclined to choose them, right?" Shu Yuqin pondered, starting to grasp Clara Joy's point.

"That's what I think, but I'm not entirely sure," Clara Joy admitted, a hint of uncertainty in her voice.

Shu Yuqin gently patted Clara Joy's hand. "Let’s take our time. I believe what you said makes sense. The Chen family should know to seize this opportunity."

"Let’s hope so," Clara Joy replied, her heart racing with anxiety. What if the Chen family didn’t want to confront the Xue family for such a small business of theirs? What would they do then?

Watching her sister, Shu Yuqin felt a pang of sympathy, blaming herself for being unable to help her younger sister navigate this situation. 

"Master, if it comes down to it, we can resort to force. I refuse to believe those people won’t help us," Banxia said, puffing her cheeks in frustration as she faced Shu Yuqin.

"Right, Banxia has a point," Shu Yuqin agreed, finding some merit in her words.

"But then we’d be no different from robbers," Clara Joy interjected, lightly tapping Shu Yuqin's head in reprimand.

Instantly, Shu Yuqin’s mood soured as she shot Banxia an annoyed glance. Banxia, feeling the heat, innocently turned her gaze away.

"Don't worry, Miss. Why not have some tea?" Qiusang suggested, walking in with hot water from the inn.

Just then, a series of knocks echoed from the door. 

"Guests, someone from downstairs is looking for you," a young attendant announced.

Clara Joy quickly instructed Yujin to open the door.

"Dear guests, the Xue family sends word that if you agree to collaborate with them now, they will overlook any past grievances."

Clara Joy felt a wave of disappointment wash over her; she had expected it to be someone from the Chen family.

"Please let them know that even if we don't order seafood, we will not be collaborating with the Xue family," Clara Joy replied coldly to the innkeeper.

"Miss, I advise you to reconsider. The Xue family has significant influence in this town. They are offering you a chance now, so you should accept. Otherwise, it may become very difficult for you to operate in Dock Town in the future."

"Thank you for the warning, but I don’t feel secure collaborating with the Xue family," Clara Joy stated firmly.

With a sigh, the innkeeper left.

"Sister San, you don’t think the Chen family will really not come, do you?" Shu Yuqin asked, concern etched on her face.

"Uncle Cheng, please take Cèbǎi out for a moment," Clara Joy instructed.

"What are your orders, Third Miss?"

"Just spread the word that we plan to order a significant quantity of seafood and will be looking to place long-term orders."

"Understood."

After some time, Shu Cheng returned with Cèbǎi and nodded at Clara Joy.

"Third Miss, we found a teahouse not far from the Chen family. I believe our news has reached their business by now."

"Well done."

Just as Clara Joy finished speaking, a voice called from outside the room.

"Dear guests, someone is looking for you downstairs." It was another inn attendant.

Clara Joy stood up only to notice Shu Xin standing still, showing no inclination to move.

"Shu Xin, what’s wrong?" she asked.

"Little sister, you and Second Sister go. I won't go. I’m worried," he admitted.

Clara Joy understood his hesitance stemmed from the troubles they faced yesterday, and she offered him some comforting words. But Shu Xin resolutely shook his head, refusing to go.

With no other option, Clara Joy asked Shu Cheng to stay behind with him, bringing Cèbǎi along just in case.

"Miss, are you planning to take a boat to the surrounding villages? I would be happy to take you," said a young attendant peering in through the door.

"You’re from the Chen family, aren’t you?"

The attendant was surprised that Clara Joy recognized him immediately.

"Yes, my master sent me to escort you."

"Great! Let’s go then." 

Clara Joy followed the attendant to the shore, where she spotted a larger boat, already occupied by a dashing young man.

Upon seeing Clara Joy and the others, the young man stood up gracefully. 

"I am Chen Zihao."

"This is Clara Joy, and this is my elder sister," Clara Joy introduced simply.

The head of the Chen family seemed much younger than that of the Xue family and was strikingly handsome, his face always adorned with a gentle smile that made one feel as if they were basking in spring sunshine.

"What village would you like to visit?" he asked.

"Anywhere is fine for us to look around."

"Then let’s head to Little Fisher Village; it’s where we source our goods."

Clara Joy was impressed; this was a true businessman, directly taking her to see the goods.

"That sounds perfect. Thank you, Young Master Chen, for providing us with a boat."

As the boat slowly began to move, Clara Joy and Chen Zihao remained silent at first.

It wasn’t until they were far from the shore that Chen Zihao broke the silence.

"I heard Miss Shu came to Dock Town to order seafood."

"Indeed, that is the case."

"Then I won’t beat around the bush. I believe you are already familiar with my Chen family, so I would like to discuss this business with you."

Hearing his words, Clara Joy felt a slight shift in her impression of the Chen family.

They surely knew about her standoff with the Xue family, yet he didn’t mention it, putting no pressure on her.

"You must have heard about our situation with the Xue family. Right now, our only choice is to work with you."

"Miss, that’s not quite right. To be honest, seafood is not exclusive to our town. When we negotiate business, my Chen family aims to satisfy you, not because you have no other options."

"I hope you will willingly collaborate with us, and that we can meet your expectations in terms of attitude, sincerity, and the quality of goods."

"You truly are just as they say, Young Master Chen."

Clara Joy felt a deep admiration for Chen Zihao.

At the same time, she recognized her own shortcomings; compared to such a businessman, she had much to learn.

"Then I hope you can meet my expectations in every aspect."

"Of course."

"Where do you come from, Miss?"

"Cheng'an County."

Soon, Clara Joy and Chen Zihao were engaged in light conversation, expressing the types of seafood she wished to procure.

"Miss, your ideas are quite innovative; opening such a large market is something I've never heard of before."

Clara Joy smiled, skillfully steering the topic away. 

"You’ll see my marketplace here in the county soon. You must come to support me when it opens, Young Master Chen."

Clara Joy didn’t hide her ambition at all.

Chen Zihao felt a rush of excitement; her words indicated that they might establish similar marketplaces in every county.

That would require a significant quantity of seafood…

Chen Zihao’s heart raced with anticipation.
