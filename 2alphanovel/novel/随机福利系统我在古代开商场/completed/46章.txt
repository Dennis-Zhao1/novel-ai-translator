**Finding Trouble**

“Shu Sanni, come out here!” 

“Why won’t you rent our land? Why won’t you let us work?” 

“We’re all from the same village. Even if something happened before, must you hold a grudge forever?” 

Outside the village chief's house, a commotion erupted. But since it was the chief's home, no one dared to step inside; they just stood outside shouting. 

Shu Yueke frowned. Every time these people came, they repeated the same few lines. Didn’t they know any other words? And every time, she already knew she wouldn’t give them what they wanted, yet they still needed to come out and make a fuss. 

Shu Yueke followed Wang Fugui outside. 

“Shut up!” 

“We just want to ask Shu Sanni why she won’t rent our land.” 

Standing beside Wang Fugui, Shu Yueke quietly watched the speaker. 

“Because I don’t want to rent it.” 

“How can you be like this? I admit I’ve caused trouble for your family before, but it’s been so long. We’re all from the same village; how can you still hold a grudge?” 

“That’s just how I am. You don’t like it? Well…” 

Shu Yueke suddenly paused. 

“Then just don’t take it personally. Rent our land, and let us work. We promise we’ll do a good job.” One person quickly picked up on Shu Yueke’s line, thinking she had softened. 

“I haven’t finished speaking. What I meant was, if you’re unhappy, then just endure it. I have money; it’s mine. I won’t rent you my land, and what can you do about it?” 

Shu Yueke truly found these people’s antics annoying. 

The villagers exchanged glances, surprised that Shu Yueke would say such words, yet they had no way to refute her. 

“Sanni, please have some pity for my family. I’m raising a child alone, and it’s tough. I apologize for the trouble I caused you before.” 

As the villagers fell silent, a woman stepped forward, holding a child by her side. When she saw that Shu Yueke remained unmoved after her plea, she immediately started to cry. 

“Look, my child is so young, and I can’t manage the land by myself. Could you please help me out and rent it to me?” 

Shu Yueke looked at this woman, who had been the most aggressive before. So, it turns out, a pitiful person must have their own faults. 

“Auntie, I’m sorry, but my land is already rented out. If I rent more, we won’t be able to use it.” 

Yet, the woman persisted, pulling her child closer to Shu Yueke. 

Shu Yueke sensed the woman was trying to use her child to gain sympathy and immediately stepped back. 

“Don’t come any closer. No matter what, I won’t rent it out again.” 

Suddenly, the child began to cry. The woman followed suit, tears streaming down her face. 

“Look, my child is crying so sadly. I’m all alone with him, and I can’t provide for him.” 

“Sanni, you’re an adult; please don’t hold a grudge for the past, okay?” 

Shu Yueke noticed that every time the woman spoke, she would pinch her child. 

“I’ll kneel for you!” the woman cried, her grief palpable. 

Shu Yueke watched her actions, silently challenging her. 

The woman kept looking at Shu Yueke, hoping for a reaction. 

“Just rent our land. If it’s because of the past, I’ll kneel and apologize!” 

When the woman knelt down, she inadvertently yanked on her child, causing him to fall to the ground, unconscious. 

Shu Yueke observed the child, who seemed malnourished, while the woman appeared to be in good health. 

“Quick, go find a doctor!” Wang Fugui shouted to one of the villagers. 

No one in the village knew Shu Yueke had medical knowledge, so no one spoke up, and she had no intention of stepping forward. She didn’t want to get involved in this mess. 

The doctor arrived quickly. As he treated the boy, he accidentally rolled up his sleeve, revealing bruises all over his arm. 

“This child is malnourished and very weak. He has many internal injuries.” 

At this, everyone’s attention turned to the woman. 

“I—I don’t know how this happened,” she stammered, then seemed to realize something. 

“Ah, my dear child, you always fuss about not wanting to eat. Look, now you’ve fainted from hunger. And what about these injuries on your body? How could I not know? Wake up and tell your mother!” 

“Stop shaking him! If you keep shaking him, he really won’t survive,” Shu Yueke couldn’t help but interject. 

“Shu Sanni, why are you cursing my son? He’s so small; how can you be so heartless…” 

“Uh, Auntie, shouldn’t you pretend to care about your son now?” Shu Yueke reminded her. 

Hearing this, the woman looked around, seeing everyone watching her with scrutinizing eyes. 

“Doctor, please do your best to treat my child. I only have him as my family. Even if I have to sell everything, I’ll make sure he gets better.” 

“Uncle Fugui, this woman is full of lies. That child’s injuries may have been caused by her. I saw her pinch him just now,” Shu Yueke couldn’t help but point out to Wang Fugui. 

As for how the village would handle the situation after that, Shu Yueke didn’t care. She hoped this incident would at least help that little boy have a better life. 

While the attention was on the boy and the woman, Shu Yueke quietly slipped away. 

“Little sister, welcome back.” As soon as Shu Yueke returned to her yard, she saw Shu Xinxin. 

“You’ve learned another word! Great job, Shu Xinxin!” Shu Yueke praised her. 

“Teach, teach,” Shu Xinxin pointed at Shu Yuqin. 

“I know it was Second Sister who taught you.” 

“How did it go? Was everything smooth?” Shu Yuqin asked Shu Yueke. 

She had been at home every day studying culinary skills and writing them into a cookbook. 

When the market opened later, she wanted to make it easy for new hires to learn without exhausting herself by teaching everyone individually. 

“It was somewhat smooth, but some people just insist on causing trouble, which is frustrating.” 

Seeing the frown on Shu Yueke’s face, Shu Yuqin pulled a stool over to sit beside her. 

“Come, let me give you a massage.” 

Shu Yueke didn’t hold back and leaned her head closer to Shu Yuqin. 

“You said you’d let me and Big Sister take care of you! But now you’re the one exhausting yourself.” 

“Tomorrow, you’re not allowed to go out. Just stay home and rest,” Shu Yuqin said, her concern growing. 

“Okay, I like this. It feels fulfilling.” 

But Shu Yuqin couldn’t contain her emotions, and tears began to fall. 

“Every day, seeing you so busy makes me really upset. Big Sister isn’t around, and you have to take care of everything. Just look at you—you’re getting so thin.”
