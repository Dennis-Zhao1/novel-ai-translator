**Rescue**

Afterward, Clara Joy and Chen Zihao signed a seafood procurement agreement. Clara Joy handed over a deposit of one thousand taels.

“I wonder if Miss Clara has time tomorrow?” Chen Zihao asked politely.

“Now that everything is settled, we should be heading back,” Clara Joy replied.

“You must ensure that the goods are delivered to us on time,” she added with a hint of urgency.

“Absolutely. If you’re not in a hurry, why not stay another day or two? We could go out to sea with the villagers from the small fishing village,” Chen Zihao suggested with enthusiasm.

“Sounds great! I’d love to see the ocean,” Clara Joy responded, her eyes sparkling with excitement. This was something she had never experienced in her past life, and now she could finally indulge in the beauty of the sea.

“Let’s do it tomorrow then. I’ll be waiting for you at the trading house by the time of the snake,” he confirmed.

The next day, Clara Joy arrived at the trading house with her two companions, Shu Yuqin and Shu Xin. To avoid crowding, they only brought along their sidekick, Bai, leaving everyone else at the inn.

“Good day, Young Master Chen,” the trio greeted him warmly.

They then made their way to the coast, boarding the same boat as before to reach the small fishing village.

“The boss has arrived; we’ve been waiting for you!” one of the villagers called out as they stepped onto the larger ship, which slowly drifted away from the shore.

The villagers were busy casting nets while Clara Joy and her friends stood at the bow, taking in the vastness of the ocean.

“Where is that?” Clara Joy pointed as she spotted a small island in the distance.

“That’s Kuo Ping Island, where many people live,” Chen Zihao replied.

“It looks so small from here. Can so many people really live there?” Shu Yuqin asked curiously.

“In reality, it’s about the size of a small town,” he explained.

“Do they also rely on seafood for their livelihood?” Shu Xin inquired.

“No, they mainly produce various fruits,” Chen Zihao clarified.

Clara Joy’s mind began to race with possibilities—this was precisely the next step she needed to consider. However, the villagers were busy today and wouldn’t be able to take her there. It seemed she would need to stay a few more days.

At noon, the four of them had a casual meal on the boat with the villagers. By afternoon, they returned from the small fishing village, and the sky was still bright.

Once back in town, Chen Zihao invited Clara Joy and her friends to a high-end restaurant for dinner. After their meal, with plenty of time before curfew, they decided to stroll around.

“Please, you have to save my brother!” a small voice pleaded.

“Please, I’m begging you!” 

As they walked back to the inn, they came across a young boy kneeling on the ground, repeatedly bowing towards a medical hall. Beside him lay another boy who looked extremely weak, barely clinging to life.

“Get lost, you little beggars! Who would pay to treat you?” a clerk at the medical hall sneered from the entrance.

While some in the crowd felt pity for the boys, no one was willing to step in to help.

Clara Joy glanced over and immediately walked towards them. She knelt down beside the young boy and pressed on his acupoints, while Shu Yuqin reached into her storage bag and pulled out a bottle of healing water.

“Help him drink this,” Clara Joy instructed the stunned older brother.

The boy quickly reacted, realizing they were his only hope. Initially, the younger boy couldn’t swallow on his own. Clara Joy guided the older brother to help feed him mouth to mouth.

The healing water worked wonders, and soon the younger boy began to regain consciousness. 

“Brother, I’m so glad you’re awake,” he said weakly, making Clara Joy’s heart ache for the fragile child.

“Thank the kind lady! It’s thanks to her that you’re alright,” the older brother urged as he helped his sibling sit up and knelt before Clara Joy.

“No need for that. Your brother is too weak; you should take him home now,” Clara Joy insisted gently.

But the older boy remained stubborn, gazing at Clara Joy with determination. 

“What? Are you trying to extort me?” Clara Joy thought, taking a cautious step back. She didn’t want to meddle in their troubles, especially with so many eyes on her.

“Please, kind lady, buy us. We can work for you!” the older brother pleaded.

Clara Joy paused, taken aback. “Do you not have parents? Why would you want to sell yourselves?”

“Our mother died giving birth to my brother, and our father remarried. With a stepmother comes a stepfather. We’re often beaten and starved at home. My brother fainted from hunger,” he explained, tears welling in his eyes. “Please, buy us! We’re really hard workers and willing to do anything.”

“Why would you think I would want to buy you?” Clara Joy asked, incredulous.

“Because you’re the only one who has helped us. You’re so kind; you wouldn’t treat us badly. Plus, you look wealthy, so you must need help,” the little boy said earnestly.

“Even if I agreed to buy you, how do you know your stepmother would allow it?” Clara Joy countered.

“She’s been wanting to sell us to save money for her own children’s education. She would definitely agree,” the older boy urged, sensing her hesitation.

“Please, kind lady, buy us! We will be very obedient and loyal,” he implored.

“What can you two little ones even do?” Clara Joy asked, still skeptical.

“Whatever you need, we can help. Please!” they chorused.

Just then, a woman rushed toward them, anger etched on her face. 

“Look at you two, slacking off instead of working at home!” she shouted. “I see you’ve gone wild! If someone hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have known you were here!”

Clara Joy stepped in to intervene. “Hey, who are you? What do you think you’re doing?”

“This girl is a good person; she just saved my brother!” the older boy found his courage and defended Clara Joy.

The woman’s eyes narrowed, and she sneered, “Oh really? What did she do to my child?” she demanded, pulling back the sleeve of the younger boy to inspect him.

“Didn’t you cause this?” 

“Pay up!” 

Clara Joy watched the woman’s performance with a cold gaze. Did she really think everyone was blind? 

“Lady, wasn’t it you who beat your child? Today, he fainted from hunger, and this kind lady helped him!” the older boy exclaimed, pretending to be confused.

The woman’s anger flared even more. “Ungrateful little wretches! After all these years I’ve taken care of you!” she cried, pointing a finger at the older boy’s head.

“I don’t care. My child is hurt, and you owe me money,” she insisted, her face devoid of shame despite the crowd’s disapproval.

“Everyone can see this. You think you can extort me?” Clara Joy challenged.

“Besides, these two children are now mine. They have nothing to do with you!” 

Thus, the scene unfolded, with Clara Joy standing firm against the woman, determined to protect the boys who had captured her heart.
