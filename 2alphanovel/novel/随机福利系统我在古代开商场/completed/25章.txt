**Falling Ill Like a Spun Thread**

“We can’t just sit here and wait for death. Besides, maybe they’re just trying to scare us,” Clara Joy suddenly stood up and declared.

“Second Sister, let’s go cook! Eldest Sister, you keep an eye on Mother,” said Ethan Jade, urging the others.

“No, no! Don’t leave my side!” Wang Rong’s nerves frayed further at Clara’s words. She pulled her three children close, wrapping them tightly in her arms.

“Mother, it’s fine. We’re just going to cook. Nothing will happen,” Clara Joy reassured her, trying to calm her down.

As they started the fire, Clara Joy kept sending mental signals to the system, wishing for poison. 

“Ding! Rewarding the host with a bottle of hallucinogenic potion.”

“Host, the poison is uncontrollable and could harm others in the village, so the system has rewarded you with a hallucinogenic potion. This potion will cause people to become disoriented, believing they have already completed the actions they intended. They will also fall into a dream-like state for a while,” the system explained, slightly worried Clara Joy might be upset for not receiving the desired poison.

Clara Joy nodded; having this potion was better. It could buy them precious time. By the time those people smelled the potion, they would think the family had been killed, and that woman shouldn’t notice for a while.

But who could have leaked information about their increasingly better lives? Clara Joy didn’t believe that woman thought so highly of them as to send someone to follow them around daily.

Suddenly, she thought of Zhou Cuihua, who had gone out in the middle of the night and had been beaten by Wang Yuanyi but still denied meeting any other men. When asked what she was doing, she couldn’t come up with a coherent answer. If they escaped this time, Clara was determined to pry some answers out of Zhou Cuihua.

Encouraging Wang Rong to eat, the family sat together in silence, no one daring to speak. Clara Joy had already sprinkled the hallucinogenic potion around their thatched cottage, and since they had consumed the spiritual water, they had nothing to worry about.

“Let’s take turns sleeping. Maybe it won’t be tonight. If they don’t come, we’ll be the ones who suffer,” Clara suggested. 

But Wang Rong refused to separate from them, even if they were in the same room. She hugged the blankets and squeezed herself in between Clara Joy and the others instead of sleeping in her own bed.

In the dead of night, Wang Rong suddenly screamed, startling Clara Joy and the others awake.

Wang Rong, with a resolute expression, got up from the bed, looking like a different person. “Mother, where are you going?”

“Be good, you all stay here. Mother just needs to go out to the bathroom.”

Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan exchanged glances and followed her, but Wang Rong firmly insisted they stay in the room. “Don’t cause a ruckus. It’ll only bring them here.”

“I’ve never been prepared for this. This time, no matter what, I must protect you all.” Wang Rong looked at Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan with pleading eyes, not allowing them to follow her.

Seeing Wang Rong’s determination, Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan couldn’t help but shed tears. “Mother, don’t go out alone. We’ll go together. Even if we die, we’ll die as a family.”

Waiting for uncertain danger was too torturous.

“No, I want you to be safe. I only have one request: if I come back safely, can you put aside your resentment towards me and trust me a little more?” 

Clara and the others nodded in unison, agreeing. 

Wang Rong immediately shut the door and ran out. 

Inside the room, Clara Joy and the others could still hear Wang Rong’s voice calling out. Thankfully, their home was at the village’s edge, away from other families; otherwise, they surely would have disturbed someone.

“I know you’re nearby. If something happens, come at me and don’t hurt my children!”

“I, Wang Rong, am willing to die in their place!”

The wind rustled, and the leaves trembled. Wang Rong stood outside in the yard, terrified but resolute.

Clara Joy opened the door, and in the moonlight, she saw several figures emerging from the surrounding woods. Her heart raced, and she dashed out, wanting to pull Wang Rong back. 

As long as those people got closer, the hallucinogenic potion would take effect. 

But those figures stopped just a bit too far from the enclosure around the yard. 

Seeing one man draw his bow, Clara Joy quickly glanced around and saw Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin had also come out. She smiled at them; at least they were all together, then closed her eyes.

Suddenly, a loud clang echoed through the night. 

“Get back inside! Don’t be in the way!” a raspy male voice commanded.

Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan reacted quickly, each grabbing one of the others and retreating. They backed into the house, leaving just a small opening.

Clara Joy peered through the gap, watching shadows flicker and hearing the sounds of weapons clashing. 

But within moments, the noise faded entirely, and Clara Joy could see that the men who had come to help them had emerged victorious.

She opened the door and rushed outside, wanting to express her gratitude, but the man simply glanced back and walked away.

“Thank you!” Clara Joy shouted into the air, her voice filled with sincerity.

Glancing at the few figures lying in front of her, she called Shu Qingyan to help her pour the potion into their mouths. 

Then, Clara Joy lifted each one, using the moonlight to throw them into the woods while Shu Qingyan, worried about her getting too tired, called Shu Yuqin to help carry the burden.

When they woke up, they would only think the mission was accomplished and that Clara Joy and her family had been killed.

“Danger averted. No threats detected in the recent period. The host can live normally.”

Back inside the house, Clara Joy and the others finally relaxed. But Wang Rong had no idea that danger had passed, and Clara Joy wasn’t sure how to tell her.

“Mother, I think those people won’t be coming back for a while. They’ll believe there’s a strong protector watching over us,” Clara Joy could only offer her mother this comforting thought.

Wang Rong didn’t want her children to worry about her, so she nodded. “Yes, that powerful protector is skilled. That woman will likely prepare even more. It will certainly take time.”

“Let’s get some sleep, okay?” Wang Rong urged, pulling the blanket over Clara Joy and the others.

The three of them, still trusting the system, fell asleep, though their rest was not particularly deep, and none of them noticed Wang Rong’s distress.

It wasn’t until their usual waking time that Clara Joy opened her eyes and found Wang Rong burning with fever.

“Mother! Mother!” Clara Joy called out repeatedly.

But Wang Rong only frowned and stirred slightly, not waking. 

“Please! Don’t hurt my children!”

“Please, don’t harm my children!”

“Don’t! No!”

Clara Joy took her pulse, realizing her mother’s excessive worry had weighed heavily on her heart, possibly exacerbated by the chill from last night’s outing.

She rushed to Chen Ping’s house to report their safety and asked Li An to help get an ox cart from the village chief’s house.

Together, they went to town to buy medicine for Wang Rong, also picking up some alcohol to help cool her body.

After a few days on the medicine Clara Joy prepared, Wang Rong's condition gradually improved. Clara Joy monitored her pulse and found no lingering issues.

Yet, Wang Rong continued to lose weight, lying in bed day after day, tears streaming down her face.
