**Trouble Maker**

“It's all your fault for speaking out of turn! How could I have given birth to such a rebellious daughter?” Ning scolded, turning around to slap Song Qingqing across the face. 

“Mom, I was just speaking the truth,” Song Qingqing said, covering her face, fighting back tears as she spoke defiantly.

Seeing that Song Qingqing dared to retort, Ning raised her hand again, but Clara Joy quickly stepped forward and pulled her away before she could strike. 

Ning's hand swung through empty air, and she found herself facing Clara again, ready to release her pent-up anger on her as well. 

“You little wretch, think you can escape? Just wait until I deal with you!” 

“I should have suffocated you at birth; it would have saved me a mouth to feed and spared me from all this trouble,” she continued, her rage spilling over.

As she spoke, Ning reached out again, but before she could land a blow, someone caught her hand. 

“Ah!” 

Shu Qingyan looked at Ning, who let out a wailing scream that sounded like a pig being slaughtered, and she couldn't help but roll her eyes in disdain. 

“Let go! Let go! I can handle my own daughter!” Ning cried, writhing in pain. 

“You're beating your own daughter, but why does it look like you're aiming at my sister instead? Do you really think we’re easy to bully?” Clara shot back, her tone sharp and unwavering.

In her heart, Clara applauded herself for seizing this opportunity to show the villagers that even though they were just a few women, they were not to be trifled with.

With a flick of her wrist, Clara applied a bit more pressure, and with a loud crack, Ning's shoulder dislocated. 

“Ah! You’ve killed me!” 

“Help! My arm is broken!” 

“You little wretches, you’re all worthless!” 

“Don’t worry, it’s just a dislocation.” Clara brushed her hands together and pulled Shu Yueke over. 

“Little sister, get the money.” 

“Got it!” 

Shu Yueke replied cheerfully, which only infuriated Ning further. 

“Aunt Ning, three hundred coins should be enough to get that arm fixed and even earn you a little extra. Just take it easy and heal for a while,” Clara added with a smirk, relishing the thought of how Ning would cope without being able to hit people for some time.

The villagers watching the scene were at a loss for words. Should they feel pity for Ning? After all, she started the trouble, and now, despite having a chance to heal, she was still in pain. But in a way, she was also receiving compensation for her injuries. 

What stood out to the villagers was the unmistakable message: the Shu family was not to be messed with. 

Song Qingqing watched her mother rush off with the money, her expression indifferent, even slightly apathetic. 

“Eldest sister, thank you.” 

“No need to thank me. I didn’t help you; I just seized the opportunity to prevent someone from wasting our time,” Clara replied coolly, maintaining her serious demeanor.

But deep down, Song Qingqing understood that while there were many ways to punish her mother for causing trouble, dislocating her shoulder meant she wouldn't be able to hit anyone for a long time. 

“Alright, well, I really do appreciate it!” Song Qingqing said lightly, ignoring her swollen face. 

Shu Yueke couldn't help but chuckle at Clara’s awkwardness. 

After Song Qingqing left, Wang Rong didn’t bother to ask why Clara acted that way; she attributed the changes to divine guidance. 

This whole affair had wasted nearly an hour. 

After descending the mountain yesterday, Shu Yueke had gone to town to sell some herbs, while Clara and Shu Yuqin had climbed back up the mountain, resulting in an abundance of chestnuts and hawthorns at home. 

Shu Yueke washed the hawthorns and chestnuts while Clara and Wang Rong scored the chestnuts. Meanwhile, Shu Yuqin was busy cooking hawthorn dumplings and sweetened chestnuts. Occasionally, Shu Yueke would tend to the fire, and whenever Shu Yuqin felt exhausted, Clara would step in to help under her guidance. 

By the time they finished processing all the hawthorns and chestnuts, it was already past afternoon. The group had been so busy that they hadn’t eaten lunch, snacking only on a few chestnuts and hawthorns during brief breaks. 

Wang Rong felt particularly pained at such times, knowing how precious the sugar they were using was. 

After a short rest, the three of them, except for Shu Yuqin who went to make dinner, began wrapping the chestnuts and hawthorns in paper, one pound per package. 

Perhaps due to their exhaustion, everyone slept particularly soundly that night. 

As a result, they all woke up late, and when Li An arrived with the ox cart, the Shu family had yet to have breakfast. 

Worried about missing their spot, Shu Yueke and Shu Yuqin decided to head to the county to buy some supplies. 

Wang Rong and Shu Yuqin stayed behind to weigh the chestnuts and hawthorns that Chen Ping and Song Qingqing had picked the previous day and processed. 

When they reached the county, it was already bustling with activity. In a somewhat less favorable spot, Shu Yueke set up the table she had brought from home, laying out a beautiful cloth on it. Li An helped unload the contents of the chicken basket and then went off to find work, intending to return home at noon. 

This way, he could earn a bit more; Shu Yueke had offered him twenty coins a day, and with some extra work, he could earn thirty coins in total. 

Shu Yueke and Clara Joy set up their packages of sweetened chestnuts and hawthorns on the table, opening one of each. 

“Come get your sugar-glazed chestnuts and snowflake hawthorns! Our sweetened chestnuts are so sticky and fragrant, and the snowflake hawthorns are the perfect balance of sweet and sour!” 

“Don’t miss out as you pass by! It’s our first day selling, so we have discounts! One bag of sweetened chestnuts for seven coins, two for thirteen coins, and one bag of sugar-coated hawthorns for eight coins, two for fifteen coins! The more you buy, the more you save! Come take a look!” 

Shu Yueke shouted at the top of her lungs, while Clara was responsible for handling the sales and collecting money. 

After a few bags were sold, a chubby middle-aged man passing by chuckled at her call. 

“Girl, hawthorns are usually cheaper than chestnuts this season; how come yours cost more?” 

Shu Yueke smiled broadly at the man, noticing a crowd gathering around them. She inwardly gave herself a pat on the back for preparing for this before heading into town. 

“Uncle, don’t laugh! Come closer and take a look; our hawthorns are genuinely coated in a layer of sugar. Just taste one and you’ll know how delightful it is!” she cheerfully explained. 

“Wow, they really are coated in sugar! With sugar prices being high nowadays, your hawthorns aren’t overpriced at all. Wait, did you say one bag for eight coins and two for fifteen?” 

“That’s right, Uncle! The more you buy, the more you earn!” 

“Alright, I’ll take two bags of hawthorns.” 

“Uncle, wait! You need to try our chestnuts too! They’re fragrant and sticky, and they’re also made with sugar, leaving your mouth sweet after eating!” 

“Oh, girl, hurry and pack me two bags of chestnuts! Just the smell is enough to make me hungry, and with your sister's description, my stomach is already rumbling!” 

Clara quickly handed over the chestnuts and took the man’s money, smiling at him. 

Though she was generally quiet and had a serious demeanor, she knew how to smile at customers. 

“Hmm, these chestnuts are really delicious! They’re so fragrant!” the man exclaimed after opening a bag, smacking his lips. “After eating, my lips are sweet; this money spent is definitely...” 

His last words were drowned out by the rush of people trying to buy from the stall. 

“Don’t shove! I want to buy too!”
