**Song Qingqing's Thoughts**

The next day, as Clara Joy got out of bed, the faint sound of the system echoed in her mind.  
“Ding! Rewarding the host with a twenty-year-old ginseng root.”  

“What’s going on? You look a bit eerie,” said Shuqing Yan, noticing Clara Joy's vacant stare at the wall ahead.  
Shu Yuqin waved her hand in front of Clara Joy's face when she didn’t respond.  
“She said I got a ginseng root as a reward,” Clara Joy finally snapped back to reality and explained.  
On the day the system appeared, she had already told her two close friends about it. After more than ten years of friendship in her previous life, she trusted them. If she hadn’t shared, they would have figured it out quickly, and it would create unnecessary distance between them.  

“Really?”  
Clara Joy nodded, and with a thought, she commanded the system to transfer the item. Instantly, a perfectly preserved root of ginseng appeared in her hand.  
“Wow, it really is a ginseng root! This is amazing!” Shu Yuqin exclaimed in surprise.  

“Why are you girls chattering away in bed? Come down for breakfast!” Wang Rong called from the kitchen as she stepped through the doorway.  
Shuqing Yan and Shu Yuqin instinctively moved to shield Clara Joy from view.  
“We’ll be right there!” Shu Yuqin replied cheerfully.  

Wang Rong didn’t notice anything unusual, merely reminding them to hurry before leaving.  
Shu Yuqin patted her chest, still feeling a bit shaken.  
“Let’s not do any more rewards at home from now on; what if we get caught?” Shuqing Yan said seriously.  

Clara Joy pulled out the ginseng she had hastily hidden in her blankets, her heart aching.  
Two of its roots were broken.  
“Wahhh~ This is going to cost me a fortune,” Clara Joy lamented as she cradled the ginseng in her arms.  

“Don’t worry, host. It can be repaired. Also, I have a storage space. After you open it, you can store anything other than living creatures. Would you like me to repair the ginseng and open the storage space?” the system’s sweet voice chimed in.  
Clara Joy’s expression brightened as she wiped away her tears and smiled.  
“Of course, repair it! But about the storage space—if I put things in there, you won’t run off with them, will you?” Clara Joy teased, her spirits lifting.  

“Absolutely not! You can trust me, master.”  
“Alright then, I was just joking. Please open the storage space for me.” After the system explained everything thoroughly, Clara Joy felt less wary of it.  

“What’s going on? You suddenly look so happy,” Shuqing Yan asked, quickly slipping on her outer jacket.  
“I can repair the ginseng, and I also got an extra storage space!”

In the morning, Chen Ping returned with Li An, but both of them were reluctant to stay for lunch.  
In the afternoon, Song Qingqing came with a backpack to call for Clara Joy and the others.  
Most of the household chores were done by Li An, with Wang Rong and Chen Ping helping out. If it weren’t for waiting for Song Qingqing, Clara Joy and her sisters would have already headed up the mountain.  

Upon hearing Song Qingqing’s voice, the three of them immediately grabbed a backpack borrowed from Chen Ping’s house and headed out.  
On the way, Song Qingqing noticed they were heading towards the inner areas of the mountain. Although she felt uneasy, she refrained from asking.  
“Don’t worry; my sister and the others found some food around the inner areas yesterday,” Clara Joy reassured her, sensing her tension.  

“Will there be wild beasts near the inner area?” Song Qingqing asked quietly.  
“No, the wild beasts are deeper within the inner area,” Clara Joy replied confidently, as the system kept assuring her of safety.  
That’s right, she had intended to test if the system could help her detect danger after arriving on the mountain. To her surprise, it indeed worked, even indicating the good things within a two-hundred-meter radius around her. Clara Joy couldn’t help but marvel at how useful this system was.  

“Straight ahead, one hundred meters to the left, there’s a hundred-year-old He Shou Wu. Beneficial for the host, beneficial for the host, beneficial for the host.”  
“Beneficial, beneficial, beneficial for the host.”  
“Beneficial, beneficial, host deviation.”  

After Clara Joy ignored several items, the system seemed to get stuck, endlessly repeating its message.  
With no other choice, she had to dig up the He Shou Wu.  
“What is this thing?” Song Qingqing asked, looking at the long, arm-sized tuber Clara Joy had unearthed, puzzled.  
“This is a medicinal herb called He Shou Wu. It can be sold for money,” Clara Joy explained simply.  

She was troubled. If she took this back to the village and then to the town to sell, it would surely attract thieves’ attention. But if she didn’t, people would start to suspect her family’s need for money.  
“After we take it back and sell it, I can handle any trouble that comes up,” Shuqing Yan said.  
Clara Joy nodded in agreement.  
Meanwhile, Song Qingqing had already been pulled away by Shu Yuqin to dig for sweet potatoes.  

The system continued to chatter about where to find good items, which annoyed Clara Joy. She promptly muted it.  
She realized she couldn’t rely entirely on the system to get rich; otherwise, her life would lose its meaning. By simply following the system’s instructions and gathering herbs all day, she could become wealthier than many, yet it would make her seem like a puppet of the system.  
Besides, she didn’t want to attract unwanted attention—she didn’t want to be seen as some lucky charm.  
“From now on, don’t give me such hints again,” Clara Joy commanded in her mind.  

The four of them worked together—one digging sweet potatoes, two gathering chestnuts, and one picking hawthorn berries. Before long, their backpacks were full, and they split everything equally among themselves.  
On the way down the mountain, Song Qingqing hesitated, wanting to say something.  
“Big sister, second sister, third sister, you said you want to make money with these things, right? Can I sell what’s in my backpack too? Just let me know when, and I’ll put the money with you.”  

Clara Joy immediately recognized that Song Qingqing was a girl with plans; she wouldn’t act like other girls of this era. But if she suddenly wanted to save money, it surely meant something else was happening.  
“What’s going on?”  
“I overheard my mom and dad discussing marrying me off to the old official in town next year and saving money for my brother’s education.”  
Clara Joy frowned.  
“Your mom is awful,” Shu Yuqin commented.  
“You don’t need to worry. Since you mentioned making money, I’ve already got a plan. I’ll save up more money and buy my freedom, cutting ties with them.”  
“Since you’ve thought it through, we’ll definitely help you,” Clara Joy assured her.  
But even as best friends, they had to keep accounts clear.  
“To be honest, we plan to process what we gather further and will need some raw materials and labor, so it’s hard to calculate the price. How about we weigh it and pay you by the pound? Whatever you gather, you can sell to us later.”  
“That sounds fair; clear and straightforward.”  
“However, we don’t know how much to charge yet, so I can’t tell you how much per pound. Also, I don’t have any money on me right now; I’ll owe you for this backpack.”  
“I trust you!”  

So, Song Qingqing’s backpack made its way to Clara Joy’s house, with just a little left for her mother as a gesture.  
At home, Li An had already finished all the tasks he could manage, and outside Clara Joy’s house, they had even erected a fence woven from bamboo.
