**The Betrayer**

The wolf mother heard Clara Joy's words, and a hint of reluctance flickered in her eyes before she turned away, returning to her den with a sense of melancholy. Clara Joy understood that this situation would take time to resolve.

She made her way back to the werewolf's den, recalling the long shirt she had purchased for him when she first arrived. As the werewolf departed, Clara Joy retrieved it from her storage bag.

When the werewolf returned and spotted the shirt lying in his sleeping spot, he looked puzzled. Clara Joy noticed his confusion and tugged at her own clothes. After a moment of contemplation, the werewolf seemed to understand.

Although he had initially been unclothed, he had covered his vital areas with leaves. So, while the werewolf changed into the shirt, Clara Joy stepped outside the den.

After waiting for quite a while, she could occasionally hear the werewolf's anxious howling. Somehow, she found it amusing. But when the werewolf finally emerged, fully dressed and without any mistakes, Clara Joy couldn’t help but think that despite the werewolf's inability to understand human speech and his childlike intelligence, he was quite clever in his own way.

As evening fell, Clara Joy lit a fire inside the werewolf's den. The blaze frightened the other wolves away, causing the werewolf to shrink back in fear within his nest. Clara Joy took the meat the werewolf had brought her earlier, pulled out a prepared knife, and sliced it into pieces. Using a stick, she skewered a chunk and held it over the fire to roast.

As the meat neared completion, she sprinkled some seasoning over it, filling the den with an enticing aroma. Seeing the innocent gaze of the werewolf, Clara Joy waved him over and offered him the freshly roasted meat.

The werewolf glanced between the fire and Clara Joy, unable to resist the tempting smell, and approached her side. Clara Joy took a piece of meat from the stick and stood up, holding it out in her hand.

After the incident with the spirit water, the werewolf had learned how to eat from Clara Joy’s hand. While she fed him, Clara Joy also took a few bites for herself.

That night, the werewolf tried to pull Clara Joy into his nest. However, she quickly waved her hands and instead found a stone to lean against, settling in to sleep with her back against the wall.

The next day, the wolf mother returned to the werewolf's den, howling a few times while glancing at Clara Joy. Once she finished speaking to her son, the werewolf nodded in Clara Joy's direction. Seeing this, the wolf mother howled twice toward Clara Joy.

Clara Joy understood this meant the wolf mother was telling the werewolf to go with her, and he agreed. Without further delay, Clara Joy took the werewolf's hand and left.

The werewolf looked back three times, his eyes filled with reluctance and a hint of a whimpering howl. The wolf mother and the other wolves responded to him in kind. Clara Joy felt a surge of emotion wash over her. She gently patted the werewolf's head, vowing to treat him well.

As they walked, Clara Joy held the werewolf's hand, not allowing him to crawl along the ground. Whenever he seemed too fatigued to continue, she would pour out some spirit water for him to drink and regain his strength.

Once they reached the outskirts, Clara Joy took out a small blade she had prepared and carefully trimmed the werewolf's whiskers, then combed through his hair. At last, his true features emerged before Clara Joy.

Though his face was a bit dirty from frequent ventures through the forest, his sharp features were strikingly handsome. 

“From now on, your name will be Shuxin, okay?” Clara Joy said, patting Shuxin's shoulder.

“Shuxin.” 

“Shuxin.” 

Clara Joy repeated the name several times. It took a moment for Shuxin to process, but soon he began mimicking her lip movements.

“Outrageous.” 

Clara Joy shook her head, correcting him. 

“Shuxin.” 

“New Year’s Eve.” 

Clara Joy patiently taught Shuxin until he could finally say his name correctly. With Shuxin by her side, Clara Joy headed into town.

Though Shuxin still struggled to walk smoothly, occasionally bouncing or stumbling, he was determined not to crawl as Clara Joy disapproved of it. Even when he was about to give in to exhaustion, he would only tug at Clara Joy’s hand, and she understood his intentions. Every time, she would pour out more spirit water for him.

Clara Joy planned to buy Shuxin two new sets of clothes, as the one he wore yesterday was too loose and baggy. While searching for a shop, they approached a crowd gathered in the front.

It was an unavoidable path, so Clara Joy prepared to guide Shuxin through a gap in the throng. However, with people packed closely together, it was nearly impossible to get through. 

Noticing Shuxin’s increasingly impatient expression, Clara Joy quickly retreated, fearing his werewolf instincts might kick in. With no other choice, she stood aside, waiting for the crowd to disperse before proceeding.

In the meantime, Clara Joy could hear the argument unfolding in the center of the gathering. As the surrounding chatter filled the air, she began to piece together the situation.

It seemed that a man had married into the family of the fabric shop owner, but now that the shop was in decline, only the man's wife remained. The man, feeling emasculated, had sought out a mistress after the death of his in-laws. Now he was confronting his wife, belittling her in front of her family.

“Even if I sell the shop at a bargain, I won’t give you two a single penny.” 

“You shameless man! You can’t sell the shop, or I will divorce you!” the woman retorted fiercely.

“Divorce me? Hmph, who do you think you are? Just because your parents have passed, you think you can treat me however you want? I’ll tell you this—if anyone is going to file for divorce, it’s me, Xia Ling!” 

Clara Joy was taken aback by the woman’s boldness. In this era, such defiance was rare, even though the tremor in her voice suggested fear.

What struck Clara Joy most was what the woman said about selling the shop at a bargain.

“This shop isn’t profitable at all. Let’s see who would be willing to buy it. You should let me manage it; a woman like you shouldn’t be showing your face out in public.” 

“I’m willing to buy it,” Clara Joy suddenly declared loudly.

In that moment, she felt it would be foolish not to seize the opportunity. 

The crowd turned to look at her, creating a path for her to step through. 

“Are you serious about buying it at a bargain?” 

Xia Ling was taken aback; she hadn’t expected anyone to be interested in buying. Her statement had merely been an attempt to save face in front of her husband. 

“Miss, this shop isn’t located in a good area, and business is poor. Are you really willing to take it over?” 

“I am, as long as you sell it at a low price.” 

“Alright, then I will sell it to you.” 

Xia Ling walked into the shop, leaving the crowd behind, unsure of what she was doing. 

The man glared at Clara Joy, his anger boiling over. He blamed her for ruining his plans.

“Oh, buying the shop will only lead to losses.” 

“Not that it’s any of your business,” Clara Joy replied, expressing her disdain for such a man. 

When he and his family had money, he shamelessly relied on them, and now that they were in decline, he returned to his true colors as a scoundrel.

“This is the divorce certificate. Get lost.”
