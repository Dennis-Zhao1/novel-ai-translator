**The Love of Bai Zhirou**

“Cousin, you need to stop talking! The officials handle cases impartially; how could they possibly be swayed by money?” Clara Joy feigned shock, quickly responding.

Wang Changyu glared at Clara with gritted teeth, his frustration boiling. The idea of using money to save their grandmother had been mentioned last time, but it was their fault for whispering, allowing no one else to hear.

“Impudent! How dare you slander the government and try to bribe them into bending the law!” Zhang Lanlan wiped away her tears, her anger sparking as she glared at Wang Changyu. “The current magistrate is known for his integrity. Are you not accusing him falsely?”

“Go to the county office and tell them someone is slandering the magistrate,” Zhang Lanlan ordered her maid, her voice firm after hearing Clara's words.

“I only said that in a moment of desperation; why are you holding onto it?” Wang Changyu defended himself.

“Cousin, I forgot to mention, this is the magistrate’s daughter. Even if it was said in a moment of panic, it still slanders the magistrate’s reputation, and everyone heard it,” Clara stated, her eyes glinting with triumph.

Wang Changyu felt a wave of dizziness wash over him. He hadn’t realized that Clara was surrounded by the magistrate’s daughter and her friends. If he got caught now, his career would be ruined.

Clara decided to ignore Wang Changyu, wiping the remnants of her tears away as she forced a smile. “I’m sorry everyone for the commotion; it must have delayed your shopping. Here’s what I’ll do: everyone who buys something today will receive an extra dish on the house.”

Seeing the frail Clara act so strong stirred sympathy in the crowd, and when they heard about the extra dish, many decided to buy something.

A few days later, Clara Joy informed Ethan Jade that she was planning to find a place rich in flowers to prepare for their future market.

In her past life, Clara had been a beautician and had watched many short videos, learning to make her own skincare and cosmetics. Since Ethan had expressed her desire to open a market, Clara felt it was time to start preparing.

The day after hearing the news, Ethan collected the wild goods they had gathered in the mountains and headed to the neighboring county to sell them, rather than setting up a stall that day.

After selling the wild goods for five hundred taels and adding another thousand of her own, she handed the total to Clara.

On the first day before Clara left, she, Ethan, and Shu Yuqin visited the home of Kan Lanzi.

Bai Zhirou’s leg, which had been treated daily for over a month while the three stayed in the cave, had fully healed. Upon seeing them, she hurried over.

“Why did you buy so many things? We have everything we need here; just take care of yourselves,” Bai Zhirou said, her gentle demeanor radiating warmth.

“Since the master and mistress live here and rarely go out, we wanted to bring you some delicious food,” Shu Yuqin replied, hugging Bai Zhirou’s arm affectionately.

“I miss you and the master too. Go put the things away first,” Bai Zhirou urged.

Kan Lanzi saw the girls putting down their items and dropped his hoe to engage them in a playful sparring match. They quickly scattered, facing off against him. In the end, it was a good, even match.

“Looks like you haven’t slacked off lately,” Kan Lanzi commented.

“Of course not! We practice every day,” Clara assured him. 

Indeed, the trio woke early each morning to jog around their yard and train, and in the evenings, they practiced martial arts in the courtyard while Song Qingqing slept.

“Now that Ethan has a whip, have you two decided what weapons you’ll use?” Kan Lanzi asked Clara Joy and Shu Yuqin.

“I want to use a dagger.”

“I’ll use a sword.”

“Great! I happen to have manuals for practicing swordplay and close-range dagger techniques. You’ll need to find your own weapons, though,” Kan Lanzi instructed.

Clara and Shu Yuqin quickly thanked him.

“As for you, Ethan, I don’t have a manual specifically for whips, so you’ll need to search for one yourself,” Kan Lanzi added.

Once they settled on their weapons, the three girls chatted with Kan Lanzi and Bai Zhirou. Upon learning that Clara was planning to venture elsewhere, they repeatedly reminded her to be careful.

After sharing a meal, Bai Zhirou called the girls back as they were leaving, retreating to her room briefly before returning.

“This is all the money the master and I have saved. I know you all have your own aspirations, and this is the least I can do to help,” she said, offering them the pouch.

“Mistress, we can’t accept this,” they protested.

But Bai Zhirou ignored their refusals, insisting on placing it in their hands.

“A teacher is like a parent for life. Your mistress is like your mother, so you should take it. In our hearts, you are our children,” Kan Lanzi said gently, unable to bear seeing his wife’s sadness.

With tears welling in their eyes, the three girls accepted the gift solemnly, bowing to Bai Zhirou and Kan Lanzi in gratitude.

Bai Zhirou tenderly patted their heads. “I understand you have your ambitions, but you must remember to take care of yourselves and to come back home to visit often.”

“Yes,” Ethan agreed, suddenly struck by an idea. She looked up. “What if you and the master came with us?”

Bai Zhirou paused, her expression thoughtful. “Your master and I prefer the tranquility of our life here. We feel comfortable and at peace. We just want you to come back and visit us when you can,” she replied with a smile.

The sun rises with work and sets with rest, with loved ones by one’s side. Ethan thought that if she grew old, she would wish to live like that with someone she loved.

Kan Lanzi wrapped an arm around Bai Zhirou’s waist, teasingly casting a sidelong glance at the three girls. “It’s probably best if you don’t come back too often; don’t disturb your mistress and my little world together.”

Just as Ethan and the others were deeply moved, Kan Lanzi’s words shattered the moment.

Before they left, Kan Lanzi advised them, “There’s a werewolf in the inner circle of Longhu Mountain. If you can earn his trust, he will be the most loyal companion by your side.”

……

Bai Zhirou ended up giving each of the three girls ten thousand taels, a total of thirty thousand.

Ethan had no idea how long it took for Kan Lanzi and Bai Zhirou to save that much money, and her gratitude surged within her.

However, Clara Joy and Shu Yuqin each took out five thousand taels and handed it to Ethan. “You’ll need this for buying land, construction, decoration, and other expenses.”

Ethan accepted it without hesitation, knowing their bond didn’t require further words.

Thanks to Bai Zhirou’s support, Ethan’s plans for opening the market were set into motion.

She brought Shu Yuqin to find Chen Ping, sharing with her the recipe for hot pot base ingredients so that Chen Ping’s family could sell it themselves.

Initially, Chen Ping and Li An firmly refused, but after Ethan explained her intentions and with her insistence, they finally agreed.

Ethan and her friends always remembered how Chen Ping's family had helped them, and even though Wang Rong had moved on, that kindness lingered on.
