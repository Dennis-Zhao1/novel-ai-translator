**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Turn**

As they arrived in the county, Clara Joy looked at the bustling crowd and felt an instinctive urge to retreat. 

“Wow, it’s so lively here!” she exclaimed, her voice bubbling with excitement.

Beside her, Ethan Jade couldn’t help but smile at Clara’s enthusiasm. The streets were lined with vendors from various places, each selling their unique wares. The atmosphere was electric, filled with the sounds of haggling and laughter.

After wandering through the vibrant market with their group, they stumbled upon a small boy selling mountain goods in a quiet corner. Clara was initially drawn to the boy's calm demeanor, but as she looked closer, her heart raced—he was selling ginseng, and not just any ginseng; there were roots that were hundreds of years old!

In a county this size, surely there would be knowledgeable buyers to snatch up such treasures. It was hard to believe that these precious items were left unattended.

“Hey! Hey! You’re selling something!” Clara called out, crouching beside the boy who had dozed off on his wooden crate.

The boy remained oblivious, lost in his dreams. Clara nudged him gently, and finally, he blinked awake, looking confused as he stared at the trio.

“How much for these?” Clara asked, pointing to the ginseng.

The boy's face twisted in further confusion. He stared at the ginseng she was pointing at and then back at her, his expression shifting to one of frustration. It dawned on Clara—he was deaf and mute.

Understanding the situation, Clara nodded, but she struggled to find the words to ask about the price. It was then that Ethan’s sister, Shuyuan, stepped in. Drawing from her knowledge of sign language from her past life, she gestured to the boy, asking how much.

To their surprise, the boy’s face lit up as he recognized her signs. He held up two fingers, his smile breaking through.

Clara’s heart raced. “Two thousand taels?” she wondered, glancing at Ethan. That would be a fair price for ten roots of such aged ginseng. But Shuyuan, unsure of how to communicate further, looked to Clara for guidance.

Suddenly, Clara had an idea. She picked up a smooth stone and wrote in the dirt, “Two thousand taels?”

The boy shook his head, his expression serious. He picked up the stone and wrote back, “Twenty taels. All of them.”

Clara's eyes widened in disbelief. “Seriously? Just twenty taels?” She looked at Ethan, who seemed equally astounded. 

The boy was adamant, even when Clara insisted that these were indeed ginseng roots. “I don’t know what this is,” he wrote back. “But my mom told me to sell them for twenty taels. If they were really that precious, someone would have come to buy them already.”

Clara felt a mix of confusion and excitement. She knew these roots were genuine, and the boy’s price was a steal. Ultimately, she decided to purchase all of them. Although her heart hesitated, she took out two hundred taels, but the boy refused to accept it, shaking his head frantically.

After some negotiation, Clara finally settled on giving him just twenty taels. A smile broke on the boy's face, and he happily handed over the precious ginseng roots. Clara carefully placed them into her storage bag, feeling accomplished.

With their new treasure secured, Clara and her friends discussed their main purpose for coming to the town—finding a place to buy a house. They agreed that since their business endeavors would flourish in the county, it was best to invest in a home here rather than in the village.

After a few inquiries, the trio felt parched and stopped by a stall to grab some tea. However, once they had a few sips, everything faded to black.

When Clara regained consciousness, she found herself in an unfamiliar room filled with other girls. Panic surged through her as she realized their hands and feet were bound. 

“Oh no, we’ve been kidnapped!” Clara thought, her heart racing.

She quickly scanned the room and noticed a door that wasn’t securely shut. Outside, a couple of men stood guard, while others passed by. Beyond them, she could see trees—an escape route might be possible.

Turning to her friends, Clara saw that they were still unconscious. Using all her strength, she crawled over to them and shook them awake.

Once they were alert, Clara exchanged a knowing glance with them before turning her back to shield them. Just then, a man entered the room, noticing her movements.

“What are you doing?” he barked, kicking her lightly.

Clara grimaced but quickly masked her expression. “I was just feeling a bit itchy,” she replied, trying to sound nonchalant. 

“Listen, don’t try anything funny, or you’ll regret it. Just ask them what happens to girls who misbehave,” he warned before striding out.

Clara glanced around at the other frightened girls and caught the eye of one who whispered, “Those who try to escape get caught and... well, you know what happens next.”

Understanding her implication, Clara’s anger boiled over. “They just took away Sister Zhang!” another girl added, her voice trembling.

Determined, Clara strained against her bonds, attempting to inch her hands closer to her friends. Shuyuan mirrored her actions, and soon, other girls began to shift closer, offering their silent support.

Hope flickered within Clara; if she could escape and report to the authorities, they could all be saved. 

As Clara and Shuyuan struggled to free their wrists, Shuyuan’s face turned red from the effort, while Clara’s sister, Yuqin, used her legs to help guide them.

After what felt like an eternity, they finally managed to loosen the ropes binding their wrists. With their hands free, they quickly untied Yiqin and then freed their ankles. Clara didn't want to leave the other girls behind. She whispered reassurances, promising that if they escaped, they would seek help for everyone.

Some of the girls looked conflicted, initially planning to alert the authorities about Clara’s escape but holding back, unsure.

Suddenly, Clara cried out, “Oh no! My stomach hurts! I need to use the restroom!”

Two men hurried in, annoyed at her outburst.

As their attention shifted to Clara, Shuyuan and Yiqin sprang into action, swiftly taking down the two men. The commotion drew others from outside, but Clara and her friends quickly incapacitated them as well.

With their hearts racing, they made their way cautiously to the door, peering outside to assess the situation. There were too many guards around, so they swiftly closed the door behind them.

“Hey! What’s going on? Where are the guards?” one passerby muttered, glancing curiously at the girls.

When he opened the door, he saw them huddled together, trembling in fear, and quickly shut it again, leaving them unharmed.

Relieved, Clara exhaled deeply. They had been fortunate this time, but they knew they had to act quickly. They opened a window and climbed out onto the roof, listening to distant cries for help echoing through the air.

Dividing into three groups, they set off in different directions, each determined to find a way to rescue the other girls trapped in this nightmare. Clara found herself in a larger room, peering through a cracked tile, witnessing several men holding down a girl who was screaming desperately for help. 

The fight for freedom had only just begun.
