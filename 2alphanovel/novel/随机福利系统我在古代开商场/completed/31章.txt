**Collapsing, it really collapsed?**

Once the rain stopped, Clara Joy found herself with an extra seventeen hundred taels of silver notes. Truly, the wealthy made money so effortlessly.

As night fell, Clara decided not to visit Kan Lanzi anymore. She would have Shuqing and Yan teach her what they learned today.

When it came to martial arts training, Clara, Shuqing, and Yan were progressing at the same pace. As her master had said, they were indeed like triplets.

On the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month, a heavy snowfall blanketed the ground, laying a thick layer of snow on the roads.

Today, they were going to the county, but not to set up their stall. Instead, they were going to buy New Year goods.

This was their first New Year in this strange world, even though they couldn’t celebrate it with Wang Rong. At least the three of them were together.

And this time, the New Year felt more vibrant than in their previous lives.

Though earning money was important to Clara, she decided to take a break during the New Year festivities.

This time, they didn't borrow the village chief's ox cart. Like most villagers, each girl carried a basket on their back as they walked to the county.

It wasn’t that Clara and her friends didn’t want to ride the ox cart, but some parts of the road were icy and slippery.

Chatting and joking, they occasionally stopped to greet familiar villagers until they finally arrived.

Upon reaching the county, they first sold the pouches that Song Qingqing had made.

After that, they officially began shopping.

With money in hand, Clara didn’t hold back; they bought clothes, pastries, and flaky cakes...

By the afternoon, they had finally finished buying everything they wanted.

Their last stop was at the meat stall Clara often frequented.

“Here to buy New Year goods today?” the butcher greeted Clara and her friends.

“Yes, Uncle Wu! Wishing you a happy New Year in advance!” Clara smiled brightly.

The butcher, Uncle Wu, grinned back.

“Thank you, thank you!”

“How many jin (a Chinese weight unit) of meat do you want today?”

“Uncle, I’d like to buy an entire pig. Could you deliver it to my house?” Clara asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Uncle Wu was initially taken aback by her request, then replied, “Although it’s winter and the meat won’t spoil easily, you girls eat slowly. It won’t keep well afterward. Better to buy a few dozen jin instead.”

Clara knew Uncle Wu was looking out for them, and her smile widened.

“Uncle, I have a way to preserve it. Don’t worry!”

Seeing Clara so determined, Uncle Wu decided not to insist further. After all, selling an entire pig would make him happy.

“Sure, I can deliver it, but it’ll be a little later, once the ice on the road melts.”

Clara nodded, then asked Uncle Wu for a couple more pig’s feet and some small intestines.

Upon returning home, the girls organized their purchases and thoroughly cleaned the kitchen.

Just as they finished, Uncle Wu arrived with the pig, but he had gotten lost on the way and ended up bringing some villagers with him for directions.

“San Ni, your family must be really wealthy now to buy such a big pig!” one villager exclaimed.

“Who in the village can afford to buy so much meat at once? Even families are selling their pigs to buy grain!” another chimed in.

Gossipers in the village never missed a chance to stir the pot.

“Can you really make money from your stall? You all aren’t…,” one villager speculated, trailing off as the others joined in.

Feeling their words twisting the truth, Clara and her friends frowned.

“Our affairs are none of your concern. Mind your own business!” Clara retorted, handing the money to Uncle Wu before shutting the gate.

As they cut up the meat, they set aside half for making cured meat and the other half for sausages.

After marinating everything, the girls didn’t feel like cooking, so they snacked on some treats instead.

On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month, Clara and her friends spent the entire day stuffing sausages, hanging them in the kitchen to smoke.

The cured meat needed to be marinated for a few more days.

That night, Clara was lightly awakened by a faint noise that signaled danger.

Opening her eyes, she noticed the thatched roof was shaking, as if it might collapse at any moment.

Quickly, she woke the other three, and just as they stepped outside, the house crumbled, taking the kitchen down with it.

They lit a torch and began to dig out their belongings from beneath the wreckage.

Wrapped in blankets, they managed to endure the freezing night until morning.

When Chen Ping awoke, she saw the snow had piled up to knee height and realized how heavy the snowfall had been the previous night.

Remembering Clara's thatched house, she hurriedly put on her rain boots and rushed over.

“Ping Aunty!” 

Halfway there, she ran into Clara and her friends.

“How’s your house? I only just discovered how deep the snow is this morning,” she asked, concern etched on her face.

“The house collapsed in the middle of the night,” Clara replied.

“Why didn’t you come find me? You all spent the night freezing outside?” Chen Ping asked, heartbroken.

“Don’t worry, Aunty. We wrapped ourselves in blankets and practiced our martial arts,” Shuqing said, shrugging her shoulders playfully.

“Quickly, come to my house!” 

Chen Ping led the four girls back, immediately tossing more logs onto the fire to warm them up.

She and Li An went to retrieve the belongings Clara and her friends had dug up from the rubble.

Some sausages were torn apart, which made Clara and her sisters feel heartbroken.

They explained to Chen Ping that they wouldn’t stay there, leaving only Song Qingqing with her.

Though Chen Ping didn’t understand their plans, she knew they would be fine.

Clara and her sisters, wrapped in blankets with some food, headed toward the cave.

Seeing that the snow wouldn’t stop anytime soon, and fearing it would continue for a long time, they figured Chen Ping’s house was too small to accommodate all of them, even with Song Qingqing.

They couldn't bring Song Qingqing along since they planned to use this time to practice martial arts in the cave, taking advantage of the time difference in space.

Plus, the cave was closer to their master, allowing them to learn every day.

The snowfall continued relentlessly, even past the New Year, growing heavier by the day.

Clara and her friends stayed in the cave for an entire month, only going out once to replenish their food supplies.

As for the meat, their storage bags were magically keeping it fresh.

With their martial arts progress surging, they were quite content.

However, outside, people were almost frantic looking for them.

...

“After over two months of training, your internal energy has thickened over the years. Now that you all know the basic moves, you can choose weapons that suit you and practice more,” their master instructed.

“Master, I want to learn to fly!” Clara exclaimed eagerly.

“Alright, once you decide on your weapons, I’ll teach you lightness skill,” her master replied.

By the sixth day of the second month, Clara and her friends had mastered the lightness skill, and the snow had finally stopped.

Thinking about how long they had been away from reality, they expected the county would be bustling after the snow cleared, so they decided to go take a look.

“Ding! Rewarding host with a Dragon Whip.”

While heading to the county, Clara received a reward from the system.

Clara looked at the whip in her hand, absolutely delighted.

The silvery soft whip, when swung, sprouted little spikes along its length, but when retracted, it returned to normal. When wrapped around her waist, it blended in with her clothing, making it nearly invisible.
