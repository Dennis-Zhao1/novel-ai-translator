**Renting Land**

On the day that Clara Joy accompanied Old Tu back home, she took a brief rest. By the next day, she was fully recharged and ready to dive into her plans.

She hired a group of workers, all of whom had experience in construction. However, she made it clear to them that they were to follow Old Tu's instructions entirely. The very next day, this team of workers headed to the land Clara had purchased in the south of the city to begin their work. Yet, since she hadn’t finalized the purchase of bricks and tiles, the workers could only start by clearing the vacant lot.

After a few twists and turns, Clara discovered that the team leader knew someone who sold bricks and tiles. She asked him to take her to see the materials. Once Clara learned the prices, she decided to order a thousand taels of red bricks. With the remaining funds, she handed over a thousand taels to Old Tu, instructing him to buy whatever else was necessary, as she felt quite inexperienced in this area and preferred to let them handle it.

That evening, Clara lay in bed, calculating the finances. In total, the three of them had contributed fifteen thousand taels—covering the fabric shop, providing working capital for Xia Ling, buying the land, acquiring bricks, and paying Old Tu a total of five thousand two hundred fifty taels. That left her with nine thousand seven hundred fifty taels.

“Wow, money really disappears fast,” Clara mused.

“Ding! Rewarding the host with greenhouse planting techniques,” came the notification from her system.

After receiving the planting manual, Clara returned to the village. She first visited Chen Ping's home before making her way to the old village chief’s house. The village chief had mostly stepped back, with many tasks now handled by his son, Wang Fugui.

“Grandpa Village Chief, Grandpa Fugui, Grandma Yang!”

“San Ni’s back! Come, take a seat,” the old village chief's daughter-in-law, Yang, hurriedly brought out a stool for Clara.

After handing over gifts she had brought for the village chief’s family, Clara took a seat. 

“I have some things I’d like to discuss with Grandpa Village Chief,” she said.

“Sure, go ahead,” the village chief replied.

“I want to rent some of the villagers’ land to build greenhouses where I can grow vegetables myself.”

“How do you plan to rent it?” the village chief asked, intrigued.

“I’ll convert the annual output of each mu of land into cash, paying the villagers accordingly. This way, it’s just like they are farming for themselves, only the produce will need to be purchased instead,” Clara explained.

“Let’s see… I can offer nine hundred wen for high-quality land per year, seven hundred wen for medium-quality, and four hundred wen for low-quality,” Clara calculated in her mind before speaking.

The old village chief was familiar with how much a mu of land could generate, and Clara’s proposed prices were reasonable—sometimes, a bad harvest wouldn’t even reach that amount.

“I can help you talk to them, but it will depend on whether the villagers are willing,” he said.

“Please inform everyone that those who rent land to me can work for me at twenty wen a day,” Clara added.

“Alright, that should entice them. Such a stable job isn’t easy to come by,” the old village chief nodded.

“Fugui, go gather the villagers. Let’s meet outside the ancestral hall,” he instructed his son.

As Wang Fugui was about to leave, Clara suddenly remembered something. 

“By the way, please don’t notify those families who caused trouble at my home before about this,” she said clearly.

Clara had made her stance known; if someone had wronged her, she wouldn’t pretend everything was fine. She wasn’t the type to act friendly towards those who had wronged her. Even outside, she had made sure to extract her pound of flesh from Xu Ziqian for his earlier offense.

Wang Fugui paused and looked at his father.

“Go on, do as San Ni said,” the village chief replied.

Once Wang Fugui left, Clara followed the old village chief towards the ancestral hall. 

They waited outside, and soon, villagers began to trickle in. There were a total of forty-eight families in the village. Excluding those who had offended Clara and the Wang Yuanyi family, thirty families remained.

As the villagers arrived and listened to Clara explain her land rental plan, many hesitated, unsure of how to respond. Only the Chen Ping family immediately approached Clara, stating their willingness to rent out three mu of land. 

Others were convinced when they learned that renting out their land would also allow them to work for Clara. One by one, they agreed.

Wang Fugui took note of which families were renting land and how many mu they were willing to part with, while Clara distributed payments. 

All the rental agreements were for three years. After that period, Clara would assess the situation and decide whether to continue.

In total, Clara managed to rent sixty mu of land: twenty-four mu of high-quality, thirty mu of medium-quality, and six mu of low-quality. It was clear that the villagers were cautious, as none of them were willing to rent out all their land to Clara.

She spent one hundred thirty-five taels to secure the lease. Since the Chen Ping family was busy selling hotpot skewers in the county, Clara didn’t seek out Li An to build the greenhouses. 

After careful consideration, she decided to have Wang Fugui manage the operation. 

Firstly, as the next village chief, he already had respect in the community, which would lend credibility to his authority. Secondly, Wang Fugui had a character similar to his father—upright and fair—but he was also firmer and not easily swayed by emotions.

“Are you really willing to trust me?” he asked, a hint of surprise in his voice.

“Of course! I’ve always known about Grandpa Fugui’s integrity,” Clara replied confidently.

“Alright, if you trust me to handle this, I’ll make sure everything is done properly,” he assured her.

Clara then shared the greenhouse construction methods with Wang Fugui, and the old village chief joined in to review them. The system provided two options: a basic bamboo structure and a more robust iron one. Due to budget constraints, Clara opted for the bamboo design.

While this method was less durable and prone to damage compared to the iron version, her financial resources were limited, and she couldn't help but feel frustrated.

Clara, accustomed to delegating tasks, finalized the construction method and handed over the greenhouse project, along with subsequent work arrangements, to Wang Fugui. She also gave him a thousand taels.

“So much money? Are you sure you don’t need anything specific?” Wang Fugui asked, hesitating to accept the silver notes.

“It’s alright. I trust you, Grandpa Fugui. I’m a bit lazy and prefer not to worry about everything myself, so I’ll rely on you to handle it,” Clara said with a smile.

Wang Fugui suppressed his excitement and solemnly accepted the money. 

“Don’t worry, I won’t mismanage a single tael. I’ll keep accurate accounts,” he promised.

Clara laughed, feeling relieved. His straightforwardness made it all so much easier for her. She had initially worried that proposing this might lead him to overthink, but it seemed he was astute enough to understand her intentions.

“Great, then I’ll be counting on you, Uncle Fugui.”
