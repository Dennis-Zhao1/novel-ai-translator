**Fur and Feathers**

Clara Joy watched as tears streamed down the face of her friend, Suyuqin, unable to stop her own heart from racing with worry. The sight of Suyuqin's uncontrollable sobs made her anxious.

Beside them, Shuxin fumbled nervously, trying to wipe Suyuqin's tears away with her sleeve. 

“Wuwu, I just… I just feel so sorry for you! You’re working too hard, and I’m afraid one day you’ll just collapse from exhaustion! Wuwuwu—”

Clara’s hands froze mid-motion. 

“No, no! I won’t collapse from exhaustion, I promise!” she reassured her friend, trying to be strong.

“But I’m still scared you might! It would break my heart!” Suyuqin pouted, her expression a mix of distress and helplessness.

Clara hurriedly comforted her while dabbing at her tears. “You have to promise me that you’ll stay home and rest tomorrow before going out.”

“Okay, okay! I promise! Just please stop crying, alright? Seeing you like this makes me want to cry too!” Clara pouted back.

In the end, Clara couldn’t manage to console Suyuqin, and instead found herself crying even louder than her friend. The weight of everything had been so exhausting for her. Why was she even doing all this?

The two girls held onto each other, sobbing heartily, while Shuxin desperately tried to console them, alternating between wiping one friend’s tears and then the other’s.

“Why don’t we just give up on becoming rich? This way, we’re doing just fine,” Suyuqin suddenly suggested.

“Ahhh, no way! We absolutely must become rich! I’ve been working so hard for this, we can’t just throw it away!” Clara protested vehemently.

“Fine, I still want to be rich too. It’s just too impressive!” Suyuqin replied, her resolve softening.

“Wuwuwu, can we cry for a little longer, and then promise not to cry anymore?” Clara comforted Suyuqin, sniffling back her own tears.

The next day, Clara found herself grounded at home by Suyuqin. Deep down, Suyuqin was genuinely worried about Clara wearing herself out—losing her best friend was not something she could bear.

“Today, you’re not allowed to do anything. Just lie here in the sun and nap,” Suyuqin ordered.

Clara looked at her friend, who kept bringing her snacks, and felt a rush of happiness. 

Taking a rare break felt so comforting.

Clara cleared her mind, chatting with Suyuqin while occasionally giving Shuxin a few tips on conversation. She even took a long nap in the afternoon, only to find herself restless at night.

It seemed she just couldn't catch a break. Getting up, she decided to head to the courtyard to practice her martial arts in the time difference space.

Suyuqin, who hadn’t fallen asleep, heard the movement and got up too. She hadn’t practiced her martial arts in a while and was feeling a bit behind.

“Hey, hey!” 

Suddenly, Shuxin appeared in the courtyard, calling out to them.

“Shuxin, come on over!” Clara beckoned.

This was the perfect opportunity! Since Clara had some extra time today, she could use the time difference space to teach Shuxin how to speak properly.

So, Clara taught Shuxin while Suyuqin practiced her martial arts. When the three of them grew tired, they would take a nap in the time difference space. There were even times when Clara would practice her martial arts while Shuxin observed.

To Clara’s surprise, Shuxin could perfectly mimic their movements after watching them. It was an unexpected delight to discover that Shuxin had a natural talent for martial arts that surpassed their own.

The next morning, all three woke up in the courtyard. Clara had set the time difference space to close just as the sun began to rise. Inside the time difference space, they were oblivious to the passing of time, sometimes waking up standing in the courtyard and other times still asleep.

With half of their tasks already completed, Clara let out a sigh of relief.

“Hey, girl!” 

Clara heard someone calling her name and turned around, puzzled.

“Uncle Zhang?” she asked, recognizing the voice.

“It’s me! I can’t believe you still remember me!” he chuckled.

“Of course! You were a regular at my hotpot stall,” Clara replied, a smile spreading across her face.

Uncle Zhang was a familiar face from when Clara had been selling skewers, often chatting with her while waiting for her to cook his order. He had even come back for several consecutive days for her food.

“I passed by here and saw you weren’t the one selling skewers anymore. What a coincidence to see you here!” he remarked.

“That’s my relative now handling that. I’ve moved on to something else,” Clara explained. “If you want to buy skewers, you can find them over there. The taste is still the same.”

“Are you planning to sell other kinds of food?” Uncle Zhang inquired.

“Absolutely! We’re branching out into rice, flour, oil, fruits, dried goods, clothing, and snacks. When you pass by again, feel free to come check it out!” Clara said cheerfully.

Uncle Zhang listened, imagining the bustling scene Clara described. 

“You’ve got a lot of ideas, girl! It sounds like it will be quite the endeavor. But once it’s up and running, I’m sure it’ll be a hit.”

“Let’s hope so!” Clara said confidently.

Uncle Zhang found it refreshing to meet such an open-minded young woman. Suddenly, he recalled the fine furs he had been keeping and got an idea.

“Hey, girl, you mentioned wanting to open a clothing store. I have a batch of high-quality furs—would you be interested?”

Clara hadn’t anticipated discussing business on the street, but Uncle Zhang’s offer sparked her interest.

“Let’s take a look at them.”

“Alright, follow me,” he said, leading her to a courtyard. “This is where we’re staying. We travel everywhere to source goods. When we meet like-minded people, we rent this place together.”

Clara examined the furs; they were indeed of excellent quality. If made into jackets or capes for winter, they would be both stylish and warm.

But the price was a bit steep.

“You know how it is. Ordinary furs go for fifteen taels of silver, while the high-quality ones are at least twenty-five taels—that’s the lowest I can offer.”

Clara understood that this was already a fair price, especially considering the heat of summer made it a slow season for sales, and traveling merchants like him were always anxious about unsold stock.

“Alright, Uncle Zhang, I’ll take the entire batch.”

She requested Uncle Zhang to help her transport the goods back to the fabric store, which had recently been renamed “Yuan Cheng Workshop.”

Summerling and Song Qingqing greeted Clara as she arrived, stepping forward to chat.

“How’s everything, Qingqing? Getting used to it?”

“I am! I’ve learned so much,” Song Qingqing replied, her face lighting up with genuine happiness, easing Clara’s worries.

“I brought a batch of goods to store in the back courtyard for now since we won’t need them just yet.”

Summerling nodded, acknowledging her instructions.

Clara glanced around the workshop and noticed there weren’t enough people. “You can hire more if needed. I have other designs I want to pursue.”

She handed Summerling the designs and added, “If you need more space, just buy it. If money runs low, let me know.”

After giving her brief instructions, Clara followed Uncle Zhang back.

Seeing Uncle Zhang's companions had collected a lot of mountain goods, Clara figured she could buy those too for her future supermarket.

So, she informed them of her planned opening date so they could deliver the mountain goods to her store when the time came.
