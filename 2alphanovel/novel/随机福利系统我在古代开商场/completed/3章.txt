**The Living Bride?**

“Qingqing, is it really hot?” The old village chief stepped forward, suppressing his fear.

“Grandpa Village Chief, it really is hot.” The girl standing in front of Clara Joy and her sisters, Song Qingqing, answered the chief's question and then addressed the villagers: “Everyone, don’t be afraid. Look, they all have shadows, and you can come closer and touch them.”

Hesitant, some curious villagers approached upon hearing Song Qingqing's words. After confirming with the sisters one by one, they collectively breathed a sigh of relief.

“But you clearly stopped breathing! How could you come back to life?” 

“We don’t know either. We just met a very powerful person. He said we three sisters are blessed and shouldn’t go to the underworld so early. Then he waved his hand, and when we opened our eyes again, we found ourselves back in the world of the living.” 

“Was there someone standing next to that person dressed in black and white?” 

Clara Joy touched her nose, blinked her eyes, and earnestly replied, “I do remember there being someone, right, big sister, second sister?” 

Shu Qingyan and Shu Yuqin nodded in agreement. “I saw them too.” 

“No wonder you seem different this time you woke up; you must have received guidance from a deity. Surviving a great disaster surely brings blessings. You sisters will definitely have better days ahead,” the old village chief waved his hand, silencing the villagers’ discussions.

“Thank you for your kind words, Grandpa Village Chief,” the sisters said politely.

The old village chief smiled as he observed the changes in them, believing Clara Joy’s words even more.

“Ah, so you all were just fooling me, trying to scare me on purpose,” at that moment, Zhou Cuihua finally snapped back to reality and jumped up from the ground, pointing at Clara Joy and the others.

Seeing this, Wang Rong regretted it immensely. How could she let the children fool their mother? She had no idea how they would deal with their mother’s wrath now.

“Grandma, we only did this out of respect for you. As soon as we emerged, you called us ghosts, and we didn’t dare defy you, so we had to admit it,” Clara Joy said, looking aggrieved.

“Zhou Jie, since your kids are alive, our engagement is off. Please return the betrothal money, and we will leave.” Just as Zhou Cuihua was about to explode, she was choked by Jia Pozi's words.

The Jia family’s marriage was not much different from marrying the living. They paid the bride price, consulted someone about auspicious dates, and while they didn’t carry the actual bride, they brought along something precious that belonged to the deceased.

Mentioning money, Zhou Cuihua stammered, unable to speak.

“Da Zhou Clan, the children are alive; you cannot proceed with your plans. Fortunately, the Jia family’s elder is magnanimous. Just return the money and find a suitable match for Ni'er and the others later,” the old village chief couldn’t bear to see Zhou Cuihua’s greed and feared she would make another foolish decision.

Zhou Cuihua glared at the village chief with resentment, patting her purse, unwilling to part with the money.

“Mother, I have a plan...” Zhou Shi leaned closer and whispered in Zhou Cuihua’s ear.

“I wonder what bad idea you’re concocting now,” Shu Yuqin pouted.

Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan also wore expressions of impatience, growing increasingly wary.

“Alright, then I’ll trouble Jia Momo. I’ll send you off, and the money is with me. I’ll give it to you shortly,” Zhou Shi said, and Zhou Cuihua’s expression brightened instantly.

After the Jia family left, the villagers gradually dispersed, but the story of the sisters returning from the dead lingered in everyone’s minds, becoming a topic of conversation over meals.

“Three sisters, be careful when you get home. I can see that your second aunt is up to something again,” Song Qingqing said, worry etched on her face, wishing she could take the three sisters home with her.

Clara Joy patted Song Qingqing, “We’ll be cautious. You should head back now; otherwise, your mother will scold you again.”

Song Qingqing nodded helplessly, but she felt happy inside — her good friend was back.

Zhou Shi and Tang Shi glanced at Clara Joy and the others before silently returning home, needing to think about how to deal with Zhou Cuihua’s anger later!

Chen Ping, seeing everyone had left, finally pulled a dazed Wang Rong to Clara Joy and her sisters, “Rongrong, have you thought about what I mentioned last time? The children are growing every day, and who knows what kind of match your mother will find for them.”

Wang Rong sighed. In the past, when Chen Ping brought this up, she always defended her mother, believing that despite her mother’s rough demeanor toward the children, she did care for them deep down.

But after this incident, she realized too late that her mother only had eyes for her sons and grandsons.

“How do you expect us to live if we move out? We have no land or fields, and with the weather turning cold, where will we stay?” Wang Rong’s face was clouded with worry.

Chen Ping had no words left. While she could help them, she also had to consider her own family’s situation.

“Mother, we’re hard-working people. If we move out, it might be tough, but we won’t starve. I really don’t want to stay at my grandmother’s house anymore,” Clara Joy pleaded.

The sisters had skills; Clara Joy was confident they could make a living, but she didn’t want to drag along those bloodsuckers.

“I’ll think about it some more.”

“Is Mother trying to have us die again? Have you forgotten why we lost our lives last time?” Shu Qingyan said coldly.

Wang Rong was instantly agitated when she heard this. “How could Mother forget? It was them punishing our family, forbidding us from eating. You were so hungry that you went into the mountains looking for food and got poisoned by toxic mushrooms. Eldest sister, I won’t let that happen again. I will protect you all!”

Seeing Shu Qingyan’s impatience, Clara Joy quickly pulled her back. Wang Rong, as the mother of three children, had it hard enough. Her reluctance to leave was because she feared they wouldn’t have enough to eat or stay warm.

“Mother, but what if Grandma wants to marry you off again? Arranged by parents, matchmakers — how can you refuse? What happens when you leave, and Grandma marries us off or sells us without a second thought?”

“Grandma shouldn’t do that, right?”

Once Wang Rong said this, the three sisters looked at her with disbelief, deepening her inner guilt.

Seeing that Wang Rong was still hesitating despite everything that had been said, Clara Joy decided to say no more. Perhaps, in her mother’s view, this was just because they had died; that was why Zhou Cuihua was acting this way. But Clara Joy believed Zhou Cuihua wouldn’t let it go so easily. All it would take was another opportunity, and her mother would surely make a firm decision.

“Oh, isn’t this the person even the King of Hell won’t receive? Finally willing to come back? Are you done with the chores at home? Don’t you want to eat dinner tonight?” 

“Aunt, you should think about how you’re going to deal with the time you pushed Grandma out to take the blame!”

“What did you say? You want to marry a living person to our Third Master?” Over there, Jia Pozi almost stumbled in shock at Zhou Cuihua's words.
