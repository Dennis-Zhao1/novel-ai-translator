**Xue Family Invitation**

Due to the events that had transpired earlier, Clara Joy and her companions were now more cautious than ever, meticulously planning their route. After five days filled with tension but no major incidents, they finally arrived at their intended destination.

However, Clara Joy couldn’t shake off the nagging question in her mind: how had someone from the capital known to send people after them, assuming they had been killed after the hallucinogenic drug incident? How did that woman know they were alive, let alone pinpoint their location? Were they being watched since they left the county?

They had narrowly escaped this time with the man’s assistance, but what about next time? The enemy was hidden in the shadows, and they were out in the open—how could they defend themselves?

“Finally made it to Dock Town! I can already smell the salty air,” said Shuyuqin, eagerly leaning out of the carriage window.

Dock Town bustled with activity; seafood vendors lined the streets, calling out to passersby. 

“Little sister, stop overthinking it! You’re just going to ruin your mood, and we can’t solve anything right now anyway,” Shuyuqin remarked, noticing Clara Joy’s serious expression.

Clara Joy shook her head in response. It was best to be prepared for battle at any moment. She leaned out of the side window too, her gaze fixed toward the capital. Just wait; we will come for you, and when we do, revenge will be ours.

As the group entered the town with their two carriages, they attracted the attention of some keen eyes nearby. They quickly found an inn to settle down.

“Innkeeper, please prepare two tables of your special seafood dishes for us,” Shuyuqin ordered before heading upstairs, her mouth watering at the thought of the flavors.

“Would you ladies prefer to eat in the hall or have it sent to your rooms?” the innkeeper asked.

Shuyuqin turned to Clara Joy for her input. “The hall is fine; we’ll come down shortly.”

“Alright then,” the innkeeper replied with a broad smile.

“How are we going to find a seller for the seafood?” Shuyuqin pondered.

“Let’s ask the innkeeper for some tips first,” Clara Joy suggested. What they didn’t realize was that while they were discussing this, a table of diners nearby exchanged glances and nodded in agreement before settling their bill and leaving the inn.

In the afternoon, Clara Joy and her companions wandered around Dock Town. After questioning the innkeeper, Clara Joy learned that the two largest trading houses in Dock Town were the Xue Family Trading Company and the Chen Family Trading Company. However, the innkeeper didn’t specify which one was more reliable.

Clara Joy decided to take her time and gather more information about the town before making any decisions. Shuyuqin chatted excitedly with Hanjia, pointing out various seafood delights as they passed by, her enthusiasm infectious. “These lobsters are best for making ‘wind-shelter’ style dishes!”

“What’s ‘wind-shelter’?” Hanjia asked, tilting her head in confusion.

“I... I’m not sure how to explain it. Just trust me on this one,” Shuyuqin replied, a bit flustered.

Hanjia pouted, feeling left out. “Fine, I’ll take your word for it.”

Watching their lively interaction brought a smile to Clara Joy’s face, easing her worries a little. It was time to go with the flow; she decided to let go of her burdens and return to her previous self.

“Big sister, let’s buy some to make raw marinated seafood! I really want to eat that,” Clara Joy said, linking her arm with Shuyuqin's.

“Alright, I’ll make it for you when we get back to the inn,” Shuyuqin agreed.

“I can’t wait to taste that flavor!” Clara Joy exclaimed, swallowing her saliva in anticipation.

With her mood lifted, she looked at the array of seafood, her appetite naturally increasing. “Let’s buy it now and prepare it to eat later. I want it tonight!” she insisted, standing at the entrance of a lobster vendor, refusing to budge.

With a sigh of resignation, Shuyuqin eventually relented. They bought some crabs, shrimp, and shellfish, then searched for seasonings before heading back to the inn.

Once back, Clara Joy rented a small room in the inn's backyard. She watched as Shuyuqin prepared the raw marinated seafood, while Hanjia, more focused than ever, didn’t blink as she observed Shuyuqin’s every move, eager to learn so she wouldn’t have to rely on Clara Joy for everything.

“All done! Just let it marinate in the room,” Shuyuqin announced after finishing.

With the enticing aroma wafting through the air, Clara Joy couldn’t bear to leave—it was all she could do to resist diving in immediately. But Shuyuqin firmly held her back, insisting that they let it soak for more flavor.

Seeing that this wasn’t a matter concerning him or Cèbǎi, Shucheng decided to inform Clara Joy he would go out to gather some news, and Shuxin insisted on joining him.

By evening, Clara Joy had the innkeeper bring their meals to their room. They finally got to enjoy the long-awaited raw marinated seafood.

“Oh wow, this is delicious!” Hanjia exclaimed from another table.

At that moment, Clara Joy couldn’t even respond; she was too busy slurping down her food, while Shuxin was equally enamored, leaving little room for conversation.

Autumn Mulberry and Yu Jin watched Hanjia devour her food with relish but hesitated to try any themselves. Was it really safe to eat it raw?

“Come on, you two, eat up! Sister, Yu Jin!” Hanjia urged.

“Is it really okay?” Autumn Mulberry asked uncertainly.

Hearing this, Clara Joy turned to Autumn Mulberry and Yu Jin. “Just give it a try; everyone has different tastes. Some like it, and some don’t. There’s no pressure.”

Upon hearing this, Autumn Mulberry and Yu Jin each took a small piece. As soon as Autumn Mulberry chewed, she found it strange and could barely swallow it down. After a moment of disappointment, she decided to grab something else to eat.

Seeing that most of the group seemed to enjoy the dish, Clara Joy decided to introduce it to the marketplace.

Just as they finished their meal, a knock suddenly came at the door.

Yu Jin opened it to find the innkeeper standing outside, looking hesitant.

“Is there something you need?” she asked, noticing the innkeeper’s discomfort.

“Well, there are some people outside looking for you ladies,” the innkeeper replied.

At this, Clara Joy stepped forward, noticing the troubled expression on the innkeeper’s face. “Do you know who they are?”

“They’re from the Xue Family Trading Company.”

“We don’t know them. Please let them know we’re not interested,” Clara Joy replied.

“They’ve blocked the inn and insist I tell you to come meet them for a small gathering,” the innkeeper pressed.

“Why would they know us and come here looking for us?” Clara Joy’s face hardened.

“It’s possible they’ve been watching you since you entered the town. Today, they might have overheard you talking about buying seafood in the hall,” the innkeeper explained, lowering his head.

“They want to meet you, probably to discuss business. I assure you, it’s nothing sinister. Please consider going.”

“And what if we don’t want to go?” Clara Joy asked, her voice icy.

“Miss, they’re blocking my inn, and we can’t operate normally. I ask for your understanding,” the innkeeper pleaded.

With a sigh, Clara Joy didn’t want to make things harder for the innkeeper. “Alright then. Let’s go see what the Xue Family wants.”
