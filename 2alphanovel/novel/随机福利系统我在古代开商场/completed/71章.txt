**Divorce**

Clara Joy recognized the two people immediately; they were A-Ping and A-Yi. The loud voice she had just heard belonged to A-Ping. Clara pointed the way to the inn, and as they walked, they stumbled upon Qiu Sang, whose face was filled with anxiety. 

Seeing Clara, Qiu Sang rushed over and lifted her onto her back. Once they returned to the inn, Clara took out some spiritual water from her space and handed it to Qiu Sang, urging her to drink it. After a long while, and waiting for Cè Bǎi and Zhang Guangming to come back, Clara finally felt a bit of strength returning.

When it came to her own situation, Clara briefly recounted a few details. Upon hearing this, both Qiu Sang and Cè Bǎi looked visibly guilty and knelt before Clara. 

“Master, it’s our fault,” they said in unison.

“It’s not your fault. The people who came are probably more skilled than us,” Clara replied, already suspecting who was behind this but feeling helpless to change the situation. She knew she had to be more cautious moving forward.

The next day, Clara and Zhang Guangming returned to the shop where they had previously discussed their collaboration. The shopkeeper called for their master again.

“Boss Chang, we’ll handle the transportation ourselves. You just need to deliver the goods to the southern border of Nanyan Kingdom. Zhang Dafu will coordinate with you from this end,” Clara stated. After she finished, Zhang Guangming translated her words for Boss Chang.

Once they finalized the collaboration, Clara heaved a sigh of relief. They had completed the necessary arrangements for this venture. Clara had also considered whether Zhang Guangming’s connections for transport would risk leaking the ice-making formula. However, Zhang Guangming assured her that he had trustworthy contacts and even signed a contract with Clara, promising confidentiality. With that, Clara decided to trust him.

The day after finalizing their collaboration, Clara prepared to head back and paid a visit to A-Ping and A-Yi’s residence.

“I’m getting ready to leave. Have you two decided if you want to come with me?” she asked.

“We’ve thought it over; we want to go with you,” they replied eagerly.

“Do you need to tell your father?” Clara inquired.

“No need. He doesn’t even know where we are. He won’t look for us, so you can rest assured, Miss.”

And so, A-Ping and A-Yi joined Clara on her journey home. Upon returning to Zhang Guangming’s place, A-Qing insisted that Clara and her companions stay another day. However, the rooms were limited, so ultimately, Cè Bǎi took Shu Yi and Shu Er to stay elsewhere.

The next day, the group finally set off for home. After three days of travel, Clara arrived at the village where the island master's daughter was said to live. After inquiring with several villagers, she finally located the house of the island master’s daughter.

As Clara approached the door, she could hear raised voices inside. “This is the family you’re looking for; Xiao Qin gets beaten and scolded by her husband and mother-in-law every day.”

“Waaah, mother...” the voice of a woman cried.

“Don’t call me mother; I’m not your mother!” another voice snapped.

“Big Sea…” 

“Get out! If you can’t give me a son, what use are you?” 

Clara burst into the house, pushing the man who was hitting the woman aside. 

“Who are you?” he demanded.

“Are you Xiao Qin?” Clara asked, ignoring the man and turning to help the woman who was crouched on the floor.

“That’s me. May I ask who you are?” the woman replied, wiping her tears and looking at Clara with confusion.

“I’m here on behalf of your parents to check on you.” 

“Father, mother…” The woman suddenly broke down, realizing her parents still cared for her.

“Of course they remember you; you’re their only daughter. What parents wouldn’t be concerned about their child?” Clara reassured her.

“Who are you? Get out!” the man barked at Clara, furious. 

Clara couldn’t stand seeing a man so cruel to a woman. She slapped him across the face several times, her anger boiling over. “Is this how you live every day?” she demanded.

The woman nodded timidly. 

“Why do you hit me? I’ll report you!” the woman said, her voice shaking.

Seeing this, Qiu Sang immediately blocked the woman’s mother-in-law’s path. “What’s going on here? Are you bullying people in broad daylight? Everyone, come and see; they are stealing!” 

The mother-in-law threw herself to the ground, wailing and stamping her feet.

Qiu Sang picked up a stone and crushed it in her hand, a fierce expression on her face. The mother-in-law fell silent, trembling in fear. 

“Do you want to go back to see your parents?” Qiu Sang asked the woman.

“But I… right now…”

“You can get a divorce,” Clara intervened.

“Divorce?” The woman’s eyes lit up with hope before dimming again. “Will my parents let me go back?”

“They very much want to see you and even sent money with me for you,” Clara said, trying to encourage her. 

“Look at yourself; if you want to go back, I can help you,” Clara offered.

“No, you can’t go anywhere; just stay home with me!” the man demanded, trying to regain control.

“If you want a divorce, you can’t stop her. She has grounds for divorce.” Clara glared at the man, who was starting to get nervous.

“Even if I divorce you, you can still live on your own. But if you want, I have a way to help you get that divorce,” Clara said.

“Yes, I want to get a divorce!” The woman’s voice was firm now.

Clara exchanged a knowing look with Qiu Sang, feeling that sometimes a little force was the quickest solution. She didn’t want to waste her breath on such a person.

Qiu Sang twisted the man’s arm, causing him to cry out in pain. “Do you agree to the divorce?” 

“Only if I divorce her, there’s no way she can divorce me!” he protested.

Qiu Sang tightened her grip, and the man quickly relented, “Fine, fine! I agree to the divorce.”

Seeing this, Yu Jin stepped forward to the entrance, where several villagers were peering inside. She took out three coins from her pouch. 

“Could someone please call the village chief?” she asked.

The sight of the money roused the villagers’ interest, and they eagerly volunteered. Yu Jin handed the coins to a woman, asking her to call the chief.

Clara watched as Qiu Sang and Yu Jin handled the situation with growing confidence; they were becoming capable in their own right. Clara had only brought Qiu Sang and Yu Jin to this village.

Before long, the village chief arrived, and with Qiu Sang’s discreet threats, the man quickly agreed to Xiao Qin’s request for a divorce. 

After everything was settled, Yu Jin offered the chief more money and arranged for him to accompany them to the county to finalize the matter.

Upon returning to the village, Clara escorted the newly divorced Xiao Qin to the county, handing over the money from the island master and arranging for her to join a merchant caravan heading to Port Town, feeling relieved once she saw Xiao Qin off before heading back to the inn to rest.

“You know, you just love to meddle in other people’s affairs. You’re exhausting yourself in the process,” Qiu Sang remarked.

“It can’t be helped. If I’m going to intervene, I might as well see it through,” Clara replied as she lay on the bed, enjoying the massage Shu Yuqin was giving her.

“I wonder if my sister has returned; I miss her,” Clara said, a hint of longing in her voice.

“I miss her too,” Qiu Sang added.

“Now that we’re busy, the three of us can’t always be together,” Shu Yuqin said, a bit downcast.

“It’s alright. Once the business opens, we can train some people to help out. After we get our revenge in the capital, we’ll all live together again,” Clara reassured them.
