**The Unruly One**

After a small wave of success, Clara Joy's family had sold off a large portion of their chestnuts and hawthorns. However, there was still a little left in the basket, and the market was beginning to thin out.

“Let’s just wait and sell what we can. If it doesn’t sell today, we’ll just try again tomorrow,” Ethan Jade suggested, looking at the dwindling crowd.

“No way,” Clara Joy replied, crossing her arms defiantly. She was determined not to leave with any leftovers from their sales.

“You stay here and keep selling. I’m going to see if I can sell some to the wealthy families in the county.” With that, Clara Joy hoisted her full basket onto her back and headed towards the rich district of the county.

Whether it was luck or fate, she soon found herself face-to-face with a young lady of the gentry. 

“Roasted chestnuts and sweet hawthorns for sale! A perfect snack, delicious and sweet!” Clara Joy called out deliberately as she passed by the young lady.

Upon hearing the call, the young lady immediately instructed her maid to stop Clara Joy. She had managed to sneak out today after much pleading with her mother and was eager to indulge in some tasty treats.

“Hey, wait a second!” 

Clara Joy perked up at the sound of the voice, stopping in her tracks. 

“Miss, how many bags would you like to buy?” she asked, already sensing the potential sale.

The young lady glanced at Clara Joy, noting how eager she was to sell, even before she had stated her interest. But the truth was, she did want to try the snacks, so she decided to overlook the abruptness. 

“How much are they?” 

“Miss, the chestnuts are seven coins per bag, and the hawthorns are eight coins per bag.” 

“That cheap? Are they any good?” 

Clara Joy felt a surge of emotions at that question. “Miss, that’s already on the expensive side!” The maid beside the young lady sighed, knowing her mistress’s comments made it hard to negotiate.

Clara Joy noticed the maid’s frustration but knew she had to make her products appealing to ensure a sale. 

“You can give it a try! Our hawthorns and chestnuts are all roasted with sugar, and you can see the thick layer of sugar coating the hawthorns.” Clara Joy explained eagerly to the maid.

Why wouldn’t she let the young lady sample the snacks? After all, she was a lady of privilege—wouldn’t she look down on trying them?

“Hey, why didn’t you let me try? I’m the one who’s going to eat it anyway!” The young lady pouted, feeling a bit slighted that Clara Joy had directed her offer toward the maid instead.

Well, this young lady was not what Clara Joy had expected. 

“You can certainly try some too; if you like it, you can buy it afterward.”

With a curious hand, the young lady picked up a piece of the sweet hawthorn. The moment it touched her tongue, a burst of sweetness filled her mouth, followed by the tangy flavor of the hawthorn itself—a delightful blend of sweet and sour that left her wanting more. 

She then took a piece of the chestnut that the maid peeled for her, savoring its sweet and fluffy texture.

“If I’m going to buy, how much for two bags of each?” 

Despite being rich, Clara Joy didn't want to exploit her; after all, she didn’t want to ruin her business in the long run. 

“Two bags of chestnuts will be thirteen coins, and two bags of hawthorns will be fifteen coins.” 

“How many bags do you have of each?” The young lady asked, her excitement palpable. 

“Twenty bags of each.” 

“I want them all!” 

“Alright then, that’ll be a total of 280 coins.” 

“Here’s half a tael of silver; no need for change. Just have someone deliver it to my house,” the young lady instructed, pointing at her attendant. 

“Oh, wait! I’ll take one bag of each to snack on while I walk.” 

Clara Joy found the young lady refreshingly straightforward. 

“Just a reminder, even if you enjoy them, don’t eat too many hawthorns at once. If there are pregnant women at home, it’s best they avoid them.” 

The young lady looked at Clara Joy, puzzled. 

“You, the seller, are telling me not to eat too much? Wouldn’t it be better for you if I enjoyed them? You’d sell even more!” 

“But it’s important to keep you and your family healthy.” 

“Okay, but I have a big family; even if everyone gets a share, it won’t be enough. No need to worry.” 

Clara Joy felt a wave of joy wash over her. She hadn’t expected such luck—selling everything and even making a good profit! 

She thought about returning to see if her sister, Ethan Jade, still had any left to bring over for sale.

Meanwhile, Ethan Jade was still at her stall, watching as people passed by. Many were drawn in by her beauty alone; she didn’t need to shout out her wares or wear a big smile like the others. This unusual demeanor made many believe her goods must be exceptional, so much so that she didn’t need to advertise them.

As lunchtime approached, students from nearby academies began to spill onto the streets, and Ethan Jade’s radiant beauty caught their attention. They flocked to her stall without her needing to utter a single word.

Indeed, beauty was an invaluable asset anywhere.

From a distance, Clara Joy spotted Ethan Jade standing in front of her stall, surrounded by a group of young men in fine robes, fanning themselves with their fans. Ethan Jade, however, wore a cool expression as she collected money and handed over goods.

“May I ask for your name, and where do you hail from, my lady?” one of the young men asked charmingly.

Ethan Jade shot him a sidelong glance. Didn’t people in olden times believe in modesty?

“Are you here to buy? I sell chestnuts and hawthorns. If you’re not interested, please step aside so others can buy.” 

“I’m merely captivated by your beauty, my lady. I wish to know you better. My family deals in grain, and I have some wealth. I’m still unmarried, and if you….” The rest of his words were left unspoken, but everyone grasped the implications.

Ethan Jade’s expression turned icy. This was beyond mere boldness; it was shameless.

And revealing his wealth? Other girls might have fallen for his charm, but she was having none of it.

“If you’re not here to buy, please leave.” 

“I merely wish for you to consider my words; look at this sun and wind.” 

“I have no interest in considering anything, nor do I have the mood for it.” 

“Such a lecherous man! I thought educated men would have better sense.” Clara Joy interjected as she walked past, overhearing the murmurs from the crowd.

“Since you’re here, your academy must be nearby, perhaps Qingfeng Academy? I’ve heard that its teachers value character above all else. It seems they’ve yet to see what kind of person you are.” 

Clara Joy pulled Ethan Jade behind her. She knew her sister could handle herself, but if things turned physical, they wouldn’t be able to take on the group behind them.

“However, I see that you’re somewhat reasonable. I’d like to believe that you were only jesting.” 

The young man looked around and suddenly realized a crowd had gathered. 

Recalling his family's words and the effort it took to be accepted into Qingfeng Academy, he felt a twinge of shame.

“Indeed, I apologize for my rudeness. I was too forward.” 

If not for your money, I’d have my sister beat you into a pulp, Clara Joy thought angrily, cursing the man silently in her mind. 

Yet her expression remained unchanged, a polite smile plastered on her face.

“Since you’ve come this far, you must be interested in our snacks. Why not buy some? Although our prices are low, we sisters hardly make a profit and have to endure the wind and rain.” Clara Joy frowned, pouring on the charm. 

“I’ll take everything! I’ll treat my classmates. Since you don’t profit much, why not raise the price a bit? That way, I can offer it as a gift.” 

What a fool, Clara Joy thought to herself. 

“Alright, I see you have ten bags each, so let’s say five hundred coins for each bag. That totals to ten taels of silver.” 

Clara Joy feigned an expression of being deeply touched, beaming at the young man with gratitude.
