**Goddess**

Zhang Guangming, Shu Xin, and Shu Cheng were having a great time drinking, and Shu Yueke chose not to interrupt them. Eventually, all three of them ended up sprawled on the table, completely intoxicated. That night, Shu Yueke's family stayed at Zhang Guangming's home. After waking up and having breakfast, it was only then that Shu Yueke broached the topic of hiring Zhang Guangming.

When Zhang Guangming heard about the ten taels of silver per month, with a promise of future raises, he was overjoyed. Shu Yueke decided to leave Shu Yuqin and Shu Xin at Zhang Guangming's place while she took Qiusa and Cebai back to Changyuan Kingdom with him.

As they arrived in Changyuan Kingdom, it was already afternoon, and Shu Yueke noticed that something felt off. As soon as they entered, they saw crowds of people lining both sides of the street, blocking their way and instructing them to park their carriage off to the side.

Stepping down from the carriage, Shu Yueke noticed Zhang Guangming counting on his fingers, seemingly lost in thought. After a while, he finally looked up and said to her, "Today is the day of the Snake God sacrifice held by the Chengrong Tribe."

“Uncle Zhang, what does that mean?” Shu Yueke asked, puzzled.

“I’m not entirely sure about the details, but I know that the Chengrong Tribe keeps a giant snake, and every year on the first day of July, they choose someone who meets their criteria to offer as a sacrifice to the Snake God. They hope this will bring prosperity to their tribe.”

This wasn’t a sacrifice in the traditional sense; it was simply a way to feed the chosen person to the snake. In that moment, Shu Yueke realized just how ancient this era truly was. Standing in the crowd, she followed everyone’s gaze to the center of the road, slowly realizing that someone was approaching.

In front of her, there were six individuals flanking a carriage, which was notably taller and unencumbered by coverings. Atop it sat a woman clad in wedding attire, her hands crossed in front of her. On either side of the carriage stood four maidservants, followed by a group of twenty people trailing behind them. The procession seemed to stretch endlessly.

When the crowd caught sight of the approaching figures, they erupted in excitement, chanting, “Goddess! Goddess!” 

Shu Yueke couldn’t understand what they were saying and looked back at Zhang Guangming. 

“They’re calling her the Goddess,” he translated.

Shu Yueke felt a wave of sympathy for the girl atop the carriage; becoming a goddess seemed to bring only this moment of fleeting glory. As the procession moved at a snail's pace, Shu Yueke found herself losing interest in the spectacle.

The crowd began to surge forward, drawn by the movement of the goddess. Shu Yueke had no way to push through the throng and didn’t want to draw attention to herself, so she remained within the ebb and flow of the crowd.

After what felt like an eternity, Shu Yueke followed the mass to a grassy plain. In the distance, she spotted a cave, surrounded by four individuals. They had set up a platform in front of the cave, draped with colorful cloth.

When they arrived, the maidservants climbed onto the carriage, setting up a triangular ladder to assist the goddess down. Once she was on the platform, aided by her attendants, the goddess bowed towards the cave and then knelt in reverence. 

At that moment, four men stepped forward, lifting the goddess and making their way toward the cave’s entrance. As they approached, Shu Yueke caught sight of a massive python extending its head from the cave, peering out.

“Looks like the goddess wet herself,” one of the men carrying her remarked suddenly.

“Looks like the goddess wet herself,” Zhang Guangming translated, his expression slightly uncomfortable.

The individuals at the cave’s entrance turned to the men carrying the goddess, speaking to them in a haughty manner. 

“Since she’s soiled herself, the Snake God wouldn’t be pleased. Take her back!” Zhang Guangming interpreted.

As if to confirm the man’s words, the snake at the cave’s entrance also seemed to react, pulling its head back slightly before retreating into the cave.

“The Snake God is angry,” the crowd erupted again.

“They say the Snake God is angry.”

Once the spectacle concluded, Shu Yueke found her way to an inn to rest, the sun already setting. After spending the entire afternoon in the sun, her face felt hot and flushed. Little did she know, she had already caught someone’s attention.

Having finished her meal, she asked the innkeeper to send two basins of ice to her room, preparing for an early night’s rest.

“Danger! Be careful, host!” 

Shu Yueke’s eyes flew open as she scanned her surroundings.

“Qiusa! Qiusa!” 

No one answered her, so she got out of bed, slipped on her shoes, and made her way to the common area, where she found Qiusa sleeping soundly on the couch.

She shook Qiusa gently, but there was no response. When she tried to shake her again, she found her arms felt heavy and unresponsive, her vision blurring dangerously.

When Shu Yueke awoke again, she realized she had been taken to a tent, her limbs bound with ropes. She struggled against her restraints, but she found that she had no strength left in her body.

At that moment, a woman entered, looking just like one of the maidservants from the previous day who had stood beside the goddess. She began chattering away in a language Shu Yueke couldn’t comprehend, her brow furrowing in frustration.

Adding to her anxiety, she felt utterly powerless; her internal energy and martial skills were inaccessible to her. After the woman finished talking, she exited, only to return shortly after with three girls carrying various items.

As they entered, the last girl shut the door behind them. They proceeded to dress Shu Yueke in garments identical to those worn by the goddess yesterday and applied makeup, covering her face with a veil.

Was she becoming the goddess herself?

Once everything was ready, Shu Yueke watched helplessly as they untied her, but she still found herself unable to move.

Then, four men walked in and lifted her up, carrying her outside. 

How was she going to escape this predicament? Shu Yueke felt a rising sense of urgency.

“Acne medicine,” the system spoke into her mind.

With great effort, she raised her hand, but her strength still hadn’t returned. Many eyes were on her, leaving no opportunity for action.

They carried her to the carriage, where a maidservant climbed the ladder first, and together with another, they helped Shu Yueke onto the highest point.

Afterward, everyone left, disappearing from sight.

Seizing her chance, Shu Yueke pulled out the acne medicine. It took a monumental effort to get the pill into her mouth.

Just as she completed this task, the others returned, taking their places once more.

Though her face was veiled, she could still see a bit when she lowered her head.

Slowly, she caught sight of the crowd by the roadside and heard their enthusiastic cheers.

Just then, a gust of wind swept by, lifting her veil momentarily, causing two figures in the crowd to freeze in surprise.

“Brother, that’s the girl!” one exclaimed.

“Don’t rush,” the other replied.

After a while, Shu Yueke felt an intense itch spreading across her body, and she pulled her sleeves back slightly.

Small, dense pimples were beginning to form.

At that moment, someone in the crowd shouted something in the dialect of the prairie tribes.

Shu Yueke didn’t understand the words, but she sensed that after the shout, the carriage came to a halt.

Someone climbed the ladder again, pulling her sleeves back further.

Another round of chattering ensued, and Shu Yueke felt the carriage turn around.

They returned to the tent, where Shu Yueke was unceremoniously tossed aside. No one paid her any further attention.

This was the fate of the goddess: when she was no longer needed, she was discarded.

Shu Yueke lifted her hand, still feeling weak.

“Miss! Hurry, I’ll carry you!”
