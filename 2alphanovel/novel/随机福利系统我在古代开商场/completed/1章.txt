**Resurrection? Or Another Trick?**

“Please, Mom! I beg you, don’t let them take the Nier sisters away!”

Hearing this desperate plea, Zhou Cuihua instinctively glanced toward the old woman, Mrs. Jia. True to form, she wore a look of impatience on her face.

“Tang, Zhou! Hurry up and pull your sister back!” Zhou Cuihua barked her orders.

The two women exchanged glances, then rushed forward. One of them grabbed Wang Rong's arm, yanking her backward. 

As the panic surged within her, Wang Rong clung desperately to the sedan chair, her nails digging into the wood. The sharp scraping sound of her nails against the surface echoed in the chaos, drawing the attention of those nearby.

“Zhou Da Jie, what’s going on? Didn’t you say you were in charge of the family? Why is it a mess now?” Mrs. Jia frowned, clearly annoyed.

“Don’t be angry, Jia Mama. I’ll handle this right away,” Zhou Cuihua replied, forcing a smile and bowing slightly.

Mrs. Jia shot her a disdainful look from her elevated position. “Hmph! The old lady is waiting; don’t delay the timing!”

Zhou Cuihua nodded repeatedly, but as she turned back to Wang Rong, her expression hardened. 

“Slap!” She didn’t hesitate to deliver two hard slaps to Wang Rong’s face. 

“Get out of the way! Are you ignoring your mother’s orders now? The Nier sisters are going to enjoy life, so why are you blocking their path?”

“Enjoy life?” Wang Rong’s eyes were red with anger as she glared at Zhou Cuihua, her gaze filled with icy disdain.

Zhou Cuihua’s eyes flickered, and upon realizing she was losing face in front of Wang Rong, her fury escalated. With her hands on her hips, she shot back, “How is it not enjoying life? They suffered so much when they were alive, and I’ve arranged for them to marry into a good family after death. I even went through great lengths to have them wed together so they wouldn’t be lonely!”

Seeing that Wang Rong still looked like she was ready to devour someone, Zhou Cuihua took a deep breath, dramatically sitting down on the ground, her voice rising. “Oh, what kind of suffering is this! I worked so hard to raise them when they were alive, and now I have to worry about their marriages after death! And look at the way they glare at me! Woe is me!”

“If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have taken them in at all! My life is truly miserable…”

Zhou Cuihua pounded her thighs in a performance that seemed to suggest she was the most caring mother, eliciting eye-rolls from those around her.

Mrs. Jia looked at Zhou Cuihua’s antics with disdain, shifting her gaze elsewhere. Indeed, she was just a country woman, adept at making a scene.

Wang Rong, seeing this, softened her expression, filled with helplessness. “Mom, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have looked at you like that, but please, don’t let them take the children away. They are already gone; just let them rest in peace.”

“Auntie, we all know your good intentions. Please let Nier and her sisters go in peace,” urged Chen Ping, a kind-hearted woman from the village who was friends with Wang Rong.

At her words, other women in the village chimed in.

“Yes, Zhou Auntie, just let the children be buried at home.”

“No way!” Zhou Cuihua shouted, then quickly realized her tone was too harsh. “Listen, this marriage cannot be canceled, no matter what!”

At that moment, the old village head of Xingyun Village finally arrived, supported by Chen Ping’s son, Li Hongshun. Upon seeing Zhou Cuihua in the crowd, he couldn’t hide his annoyance.

“Zhou Cuihua, what are you making a scene about this time?” 

Zhou Cuihua lifted her chin defiantly. “Oh, Village Head, you’re here! But this is a family matter. You can’t interfere!”

“What you’re doing is inhumane and will be condemned by everyone.”

“You don’t need to worry about that. As long as the children are happy below, I don’t care what others say.”

The old village head was furious at her unreasonable behavior and decided he didn’t want to waste any more words on her.

“Tang, where’s your father?”

Tang looked back, still holding her position. “I don’t know; he went out.”

Before the village head could respond, Mrs. Jia’s cold voice rang out. “Time is running out! If this isn’t settled soon, we’ll leave! There are plenty of families eager to marry into the Jia family through this marriage!”

If it weren’t for the fact that she didn’t want to tarnish the Jia family’s reputation, she would have just ordered someone to throw the woman out.

“Tang, Zhou! Are you two starving? You can’t even hold onto one person! If you don’t stop her, you won’t eat dinner tonight!”

Upon hearing this, the two women steeled themselves. No matter how much Wang Rong resisted, she couldn’t compete with the strength of the two.

Seeing Wang Rong being pulled away, Mrs. Jia waved her hand, and the bearers rushed to lift the sedan chair. But because there were three bodies inside, the bearers moved slowly.

Wang Rong was in despair, shouting, “No! My children!”

“Give my children back! Let go of me!” She screamed, fighting against Zhou and Tang.

“Quick! Hold her back! Don’t delay the Jia family’s schedule!” Zhou Cuihua had never witnessed her daughter in such a state; she looked as if she was about to go mad.

Chen Ping, watching from the sidelines, felt tears streaming down her face. Taking a deep breath, she rushed to help Wang Rong, trying to break her free from the grip of the others.

“This is our family matter! What does it have to do with you, Chen?”

“As a mother, I can’t bear to see this scene.”

Upon hearing Chen Ping’s words, several soft-hearted women in the crowd rushed to help, while others gathered around, trying to block the sedan chair.

Though they didn’t know why they were doing this or what difference it would make, they couldn’t let the three sisters be taken away like this.

But no one dared to look at Mrs. Jia; everyone kept their heads down, pretending to chat casually.

Seeing the extra hands helping Wang Rong, she struggled even harder. Zhou Cuihua quickly called for her granddaughters to assist, rolling up her sleeves and joining in.

“Get away from me!”

“My children! My children!”

“Auntie, please let Rong Rong go. Don’t let them take the children away!”

“Ah! It’s so noisy! Can you all be quiet?” The voice rang out, instantly silencing the crowd, all eyes turning toward the source.

“Zombie resurrection!” The bearers were the first to react, dropping the sedan chair and fleeing.

The crowd erupted in chaos, scattering in all directions.

Inside the sedan chair, the shortest of the “corpses” frowned in annoyance. 

“I said to be quiet! How can the sick rest with all this noise?”

Wang Rong was the first to react, her eyes widening. “It’s San Ni! Mom’s San Ni!”

“Who are you, and why are you shaking my bed?” Shu Ting, filled with irritation, opened her eyes, ready to give these noisy people a piece of her mind.

“Ghost! Help!”

“Ah! Who are you?”

“Can you be quiet?”

“Ah!”

“Ah!”

“Ah!”
