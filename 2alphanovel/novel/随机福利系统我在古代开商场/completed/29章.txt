**A Great Son**

Time flew by, and before they knew it, it was already December 10th. During this period, Clara Joy and her friends had completely filled their schedules. 

Every day, they would wake up at the end of the early morning hours, run around the village for half an hour, and after a casual breakfast, head to the county to set up their stall. After returning home for lunch, they would then go to train with Kan Lanzi. Before all of this, Clara Joy would always give Bai Zhirou acupuncture. As the sun began to set, they would return home, have dinner, and then continue their martial arts practice.

Due to the time difference in their training, the group had already been practicing martial arts for over a year.

Song Qingqing would watch the three of them practice and would join them for a bit after dinner, so Clara Joy and her friends could only use the time difference for their training after Song Qingqing had gone to sleep. Sometimes, they would get so engrossed in their practice that they would fall asleep right in the yard.

Every time Song Qingqing saw this, she felt a deep admiration for them, while also reflecting on herself.

On this day, Clara Joy had just finished selling her goods and was preparing to head home when she spotted Yan Xu coming towards them.

“Is there something you need, Young Master Yan?” 

“I’ve told you, just call me Yan Xu. No need to be so formal,” he replied with a casual tone, as was his usual style.

“Just say what you need,” Clara Joy urged impatiently.

“There’s something at home that requires your presence. My grandfather specifically asked me to come get you.”

Upon hearing this, Clara Joy understood it must be something related to her medical skills; after all, that was the only thing she could contribute to the Yan family.

As Yan Xu saw Clara Joy nod, he dismounted the carriage and got on the horse in front.

“You two head back. I’ll return by myself later,” she said to Shu Qingyan and Bai Zhirou before climbing into the carriage.

When they arrived at the Yan residence, following Yan Xu and listening to his non-stop chatter, Clara Joy felt her head spinning.

Finally, upon seeing the old Master Yan, it felt like she had found a savior.

“Grandfather Yan.”

“Ah, you’re here. Please, have a seat. I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you again today.”

Clara Joy then noticed a young woman sitting next to the old man, probably around eighteen or nineteen years old.

“This is my elder sister,” Yan Xu introduced her.

Clara Joy and the woman exchanged greetings.

“My granddaughter has been going through some issues lately and came to my old man here to unwind,” the old man explained.

“Oh, it’s just that my sister has been trying for a long time to conceive but hasn’t been able to. My brother-in-law says it’s her health that’s the problem, so she’s feeling quite down. We brought you here hoping you could take a look at her,” Yan Xu interrupted the old man before he could finish.

“Has she seen a doctor?” Clara Joy inquired.

“The family has a doctor who claims it’s my sister’s issue. And my husband’s new concubine is already pregnant,” the woman admitted, her voice tinged with disbelief.

At this moment, Yan Ru found it hard to believe that the person her grandfather spoke so highly of, someone skilled in medicine, was actually younger than she was. Yet, good upbringing and the old man’s words left her unable to voice her doubts.

Clara Joy moved closer to Yan Ru, ready to check her pulse. 

The old man and Yan Xu held their breath, not wanting to disturb her.

“Miss Yan, your health is actually quite robust. You are not an infertile person; in fact, your body is very well-maintained, making it more likely for you to conceive,” Clara Joy concluded.

“Then why did the family doctor say I was ill, and why haven’t I been able to get pregnant?” Yan Ru asked gently.

Seeing her calm demeanor, Clara Joy felt inclined to offer more insight. 

“Not being able to conceive isn’t necessarily a woman’s issue. If you don’t believe me, you can consult other doctors. As for your husband’s concubine’s pregnancy…” Her meaning was clear.

Yan Ru dared not believe it; she had endured so much pain over not being able to bear children.

Old Master Yan and Yan Xu had complete faith in Clara Joy’s medical expertise. However, this was a matter of their household, and how they dealt with it afterward was beyond her concern.

Noticing the somber expressions on their faces, Clara Joy decided it was time to leave.

But Old Master Yan stopped her. 

“There’s one more thing I need to trouble you with, Clara.”

“Grandfather Yan, just say it.”

“I know you are a person of great ambition and wouldn’t want to stay in one place. My useless grandson has his heart set on business, but he’s too naive and easily manipulated by others. So, I would like him to apprentice under you, to learn by your side.”

Clara Joy’s eyes widened in surprise; this was completely unexpected.

“Grandfather Yan, you honor me too much. I’m merely someone with a few clever tricks up my sleeve. I can’t compare to those who have been in business for years, and I’m just running a small stall. I have little to teach your grandson.”

Old Master Yan stroked his beard thoughtfully. 

“I believe you will become well-known in the future; I wouldn’t be mistaken about you.”

Clara Joy looked at the old man’s confident face, then glanced at Yan Xu, who seemed stunned by his grandfather’s words. She couldn’t help but smile helplessly.

“Well, if Grandfather Yan believes in me, I’ll accept it.”

She thought about it: having Yan Xu as an ally in the county would make things much easier for her. She wouldn’t have to worry about being targeted as her business grew because the Yan family held a high status here.

“Xu’er, hurry up and pay your respects to your master; make sure to learn well from her!” Old Master Yan urged.

“Grandfather, I’m older than her. You want me to recognize her as my master? Isn’t that embarrassing?” Yan Xu protested, looking aggrieved.

“But your work ethic is nowhere near Clara’s. There’s so much you can learn from her,” the old man paused, “Otherwise, you might as well just go back to your studies.”

Hearing this, Yan Xu dropped to his knees in front of Clara Joy with a thud.

“Master, please allow your disciple to pay respects to you.”

Finally, Old Master Yan looked satisfied, though he thought to himself: “See? I still have you under my thumb.”

“Once we pick a good day, we’ll hold a grand apprenticeship ceremony,” he added to Clara Joy.

Clara Joy quickly helped the still kneeling Yan Xu up.

“No, no, let’s keep it between us. I really don’t want to draw too much attention,” she insisted.

With her family background, she didn’t wish to attract too much notice.

Old Master Yan and Clara Joy had spent some time together and understood her temperament, but they still felt she was being wronged.

“Then tomorrow, I’ll have Xu’er prepare a proper apprenticeship gift, and we’ll go to your home for the ceremony.” 

“Grandfather Yan, really, you don’t need to do that. Let’s just leave it as is for today; I didn’t prepare anything special anyway, so let’s not be polite,” Clara Joy insisted multiple times before the old man finally relented, allowing Yan Xu to bow to her a few more times.

Inside, Clara Joy felt a little anxious; she didn’t even know what she could teach Yan Xu.

It wasn’t until she stepped out of the Yan residence that Clara Joy felt like she was in a dream, and she concluded:

She had a great son now.

And one who was wealthy and influential, at that.

Clara Joy refused the Yan family’s offer to send her home, deciding instead to jog back herself to make up for the evening’s missed training.
