**A Declaration of Love**

After Zhang Guangming arrived, Clara Joy instructed to head towards the grassland tribe. They were already at the border, needing just two more hours to reach the border tribe of the Mengyuan Kingdom.

As they approached the grassland tribe, Clara Joy could distinctly feel that the customs here were much more open compared to those in the Southern Yan Kingdom. Peering out from the window of the carriage, she saw numerous girls rolling up their sleeves, busily working, while others shouted at the top of their lungs to attract customers.

"Third Sister, I see so many stalls selling beef jerky!" 

"Yes, let's first find a place to stay, then we can go out and explore," Clara Joy replied.

With Zhang Guangming's help, their group found a place to lodge. They were soon ready to head out for a leisurely stroll. However, Shu Xin was reluctant to join. He was currently so engrossed in his martial arts training that he seemed almost obsessed. 

"I’ll just stay and train with Cèbǎi and Uncle Cheng. You and Second Sister can go."

"Come on, Shu Xin, you should come with us! You've been training so hard lately; it's not good for you," Shu Yuqin urged.

Among their group, Shu Xin was undoubtedly the most skilled in martial arts, thanks to his incredible talent. Coupled with his constant practice in the wild with wolves, he had become physically robust and agile.

"I still won’t go. I enjoy training too much," Shu Xin insisted, shaking his head.

Shu Yuqin pouted discontentedly. 

"Let's go, Third Sister."

Upon arriving at the market, Clara Joy was greeted by an array of unique offerings from the Mengyuan Kingdom—beef jerky, fresh beef, lamb, various dairy products, and other meat snacks.

Shu Yuqin trailed beside Zhang Guangming, eagerly asking him to inquire about any delicious foods they spotted.

"Uncle Zhang, can you ask how much the beef jerky is per pound?" Clara Joy approached a stall selling beef jerky and turned to Zhang Guangming.

Before he could respond, the vendor shouted out first, "Beef jerky is fifty wen per pound! Miss, would you like to buy some?"

His heavily accented words left Clara Joy momentarily stunned, prompting her to ask him to repeat it.

"Miss, this...”

"Don't be fooled by him; he loves to scam folks like you outsiders. Here, beef isn’t worth much. Beef jerky should only be twenty-five wen per pound at most."

Suddenly, a young man darted in from the side, interrupting Zhang Guangming. The vendor, hearing this, was clearly agitated.

"You beggar, stop ruining my business!" He yelled, brandishing a stick at the young man.

Shu Yuqin, standing close by, quickly snatched the stick from the vendor’s grasp and pushed it back towards him. "You, as a seller, should know about honesty! How can you blame others for ruining your business?"

"Let's go; we won't buy anything," Clara Joy decided, leading Qiu Sang and Yu Jin away.

After they had walked a short distance, Clara Joy instructed Qiu Sang to give the young man ten wen. 

"Thank you, miss! Thank you!" he exclaimed gratefully.

"You’re from the Southern Yan Kingdom!" Clara Joy stated, confirming her suspicion.

"Yes, my sister and I are from the Southern Yan Kingdom. My mother is from the Changyuan Kingdom, so I speak both languages. I come here to help some people from the Southern Yan and earn a bit of money."

"Don't you fear getting hurt?" 

"I’m used to it now; as long as I can earn some money, it's worth it."

Clara Joy nodded, allowing him to leave. She continued wandering through the streets until she came across a store that was impressively decorated and exceptionally clean. It felt refreshing to her.

They stepped inside, and it was filled with various items, resembling a small supermarket. Everything was clearly marked with prices, and nothing seemed overly expensive. For instance, the beef jerky here was listed at twenty-five wen per pound.

In this era through which Clara Joy and her companions traversed, every country used the same currency—copper, silver, and gold. After browsing around, Clara Joy made a few token purchases, but she still had some plans in mind and wanted to check out other shops.

Just as they exited the store, a group of people blocked their path. Clara Joy and her friends immediately went on high alert. The leader of the group babbled on in a foreign tongue.

Clara Joy looked to Zhang Guangming for help. 

"He says he thinks you are extraordinarily beautiful with your fair skin and delicate frame. He believes you need protection and he likes you. He’s wondering if you’d consider him."

Is this a love confession?

"Uncle Zhang, please tell him I’m not interested. And ask him and his buddies to step aside."

"He says you can try dating first."

"I’m not interested."

"But he says he really likes you and wants you to think about it again."

"Please tell him that I'm married."

Upon hearing this, the leader became visibly agitated. 

"He says you are obviously from the Southern Yan Kingdom. People there tie their hair up once married, but your hair is down, so he believes you aren’t married."

"I do not like him at all."

"He insists on taking you out for a meal first, so you can get to know each other."

"And if I refuse?"

"He says that it’s quite normal for such things here, and if you don’t agree, it would be disrespectful to him."

As Clara Joy glanced around, she noticed the crowd was growing larger. They were in someone else's country and didn't want to cause trouble. Even if they did fight, it appeared the locals were strong and united, towering and brawny.

Clara Joy’s gaze shifted, and she suddenly spotted a familiar face.

"Uncle Zhang, tell him I’m truly married and my husband will be here any moment!"

"He says he wants to see your husband first. Otherwise, he won’t back off."

"He also wants to see if your husband is worthy of you. If not, he’ll keep trying; even if you are married, you can still leave each other."

"Where have you been, my husband!" 

Ethan Jade had been frustrated by the group blocking his path when suddenly someone called him "husband."

"Please help me!" Clara Joy whispered urgently to him.

"Five hundred taels."

"That's too expensive; three hundred!"

"Six hundred."

"Four hundred!"

"Seven hundred."

"Fine, five hundred it is, just help me out of this mess!" Clara Joy grit her teeth, exasperated.

"Five hundred isn’t going to cut it now; it has to be seven hundred."

"Okay. Just hurry and help me!"

Clara Joy’s smile blossomed as she grinned brightly.

Ethan Jade wrapped his arm around Clara Joy and stepped forward to face the suitor. 

He spoke in the language of the Changyuan Kingdom, and the mysterious suitor’s expression shifted as he gazed intently at Clara Joy. 

In the end, the man left reluctantly, casting a lingering glance back at Clara Joy. 

As he departed, he said something to her, and Zhang Guangming quickly translated. 

"He said if your husband treats you poorly in the future, you can come find him, and he’ll love you well."
