**Reencounter with Uncle Zhang**

The island lord’s wife noticed her husband was still wearing a dark expression, so she gave him a gentle shove. 

“Old man, do you really not care about our daughter? You have a chance here to bring her something, so why are you acting like this?” 

“Miss, could you do us a favor and check on my daughter? I know where she is,” the island lord said, his voice filled with urgency.

After addressing her husband, the woman turned to Clara Joy, who stood nearby. 

“Please let me know where she is.” 

“She’s at Tai'an Ridge. Just wait a moment, I’ll get some things for you to take to her, and I’d also like you, Young Master Chen, to help me write a letter.”

The woman stepped back into the room and soon returned with paper, ink, and a small pouch. 

She handed the pouch to Clara Joy, then dictated her message to Chen Zihau, explaining what she wanted to say to her daughter. 

“Old man, aren’t you going to say anything to her? This is your last chance.” 

“Let’s leave it at that. Miss, I’m depending on you.” 

The island lord’s wife took the letter Chen wrote and gazed at it as if it were her own child. 

Seeing Clara Joy start to tuck the items away, the island lord finally reacted. 

“Could you ask Young Master Chen to add one more thing? Tell her if she can’t manage out there, she should come back.” The island lord said awkwardly. 

“Wife, go get the money I’ve saved and give it to this young lady to help take to her.” 

“Oh, so all that money was really for our daughter. You were so evasive when I asked you before,” the island lord’s wife said with a smile on her face upon hearing her husband’s words. 

“Hurry up, why do you have to talk so much?” the island lord snapped, a bit flustered. 

“Thank you, Miss Shu. It’s my fault; I’ve let my people live worse day by day.” 

“The island lord has recognized the problem and is willing to change; I believe things will get better for you all in the future.” 

The island lord lowered his head even further, realizing how he had obstructed the lives of his people over the years. 

“Yes, you’re right.” 

“There’s no need for you to blame yourself, I understand your intentions. The reason you’ve advised the islanders not to trust those from the mainland is that you don’t want them to be deceived,” Chen Zihau reassured him. 

“Please, Young Master Chen, you don’t need to speak for me. This has been my personal issue. Without your help over the years, my people might not have a place to call home,” the island lord said, regret heavy in his voice. 

Chen Zihau could say no more and maintained a polite smile. 

Returning from the island lord’s residence to the dock town, Clara Joy turned to Chen Zihau. 

“Being able to work with you gives me great peace of mind. We’re preparing to depart tomorrow. Thank you for your help during this time.” 

“We leave tomorrow?” 

“Yes, I plan to head east first, then venture beyond the border to check things out.” 

“Miss Shu, you’re quite an ambitious person—a true heroine among women.” 

“I hardly deserve the praise. I’ll need your help with seafood and fruit.” 

“Don’t worry, Miss Shu.” 

Once back at the inn, Clara Joy informed everyone that they would be leaving the next day. 

Shu Yuqin immediately took Banxia and headed out, returning with numerous packages of dried seafood. 

After five days of traveling eastward, Clara Joy and her group arrived at the eastern border of the Southern Yan Kingdom. 

“There are many people here who don’t look like they’re from the Southern Yan Kingdom—they’re so tall and strong,” Shu Yuqin remarked as she observed the surroundings. 

“Let’s rest here for a day and find someone who speaks our language before we cross the border to the grassland tribes,” Clara Joy instructed from her seat in the carriage, addressing Qiusa, who was driving. 

They settled at an inn, and that evening, Clara Joy enjoyed a delicious plate of braised beef. 

In the Southern Yan Kingdom, killing cattle without permission was strictly forbidden, even more so than harming humans. 

The town they were in was right next to the grassland tribes, where many cows were raised specifically for transportation to this location to be slaughtered and sold. 

“Girl? Miss Shu?” 

Just as Clara Joy and her group returned from exploring the town, they were called out from downstairs. 

“Uncle Zhang?” Clara Joy recognized him as the man who had sold her the furs. 

Zhang Guangming appeared rosy-cheeked, evidently having had a few drinks. 

With a wide grin, he approached Clara Joy. 

“What brings you all the way out here?” 

“We’re here to see if there’s anything new to stock in the market.” 

“I can’t believe how far you’ve come, running into you here—it’s such a coincidence!” 

“Indeed, Uncle. Are you here to collect goods again?” 

“My home is just nearby. I came back to visit my family and to gather some items from the grassland tribes.” 

Clara Joy’s mind raced—this was exactly the person she needed! 

“Uncle, do you know the language of the grassland tribes?” 

“My wife is from a grassland tribe, so I often travel back and forth between the two countries. Of course, I know the language.” 

“Then could I trouble you to accompany us for a few days and help translate? I’ll pay you three or two silver coins.” 

“You’re straightforward, girl. I’m happy to do it for just one silver coin; it’s not that hard, just a few words here and there.” 

Clara Joy smiled and nodded. 

“Great, then I’ll count on you, Uncle.” 

“When are you planning to head out beyond the border? I need to go home and let my family know.” 

“We’ll be leaving tomorrow.” 

“Okay then, sounds good!” Uncle Zhang replied cheerfully. 

“Have you eaten? If not, you’re welcome to join us.” Zhang Guangming said boisterously. 

“We’ve already eaten, but thank you, Uncle.” 

“Alright, you all go rest. I’ll finish my meal and then head home to inform my wife. I’ll be waiting for you outside the inn tomorrow morning.” 

“Ding, you’ve received a reward—a pimple remedy pill.” 

Back in her room, Clara Joy was surprised when the long-forgotten system voice chimed in. 

“What is this?” 

“This pill will cause the user to break out in red pimples for an hour.” 

“Why did I get this all of a sudden?” 

“I don’t know either, host. This is just something the system decided on its own.” 

Clara Joy placed the pill into her storage pouch, knowing it would surely come in handy later. 

“Don’t forget, there’s another storage space you have.” 

Clara Joy paused for a moment; she had indeed forgotten about that. 

“The storage space is different from the pouch. It can not only repair certain items but also has a larger capacity. If you don’t use it for a long time, it will vanish on its own.” 

“I understand now.” 

Clara Joy took the pill out of her pouch and placed it into the storage space. 

“Is this better?” 

“Yes.” 

The next morning, after having breakfast at the inn, Clara Joy and her group were ready to set off. 

But Uncle Zhang was nowhere to be found. 

Clara Joy sat in the lobby, unsure of what to do. 

“They’re here! They’re here! Master!” 

Clara Joy heard Qiusa’s voice and stood up to walk outside. 

In the distance, she spotted Uncle Zhang hurrying toward them. 

“Uncle Zhang, what happened? Why are you so late? You could have at least sent us a message to let us know we were waiting for so long!” Shu Yuqin complained, hands on her hips. 

“I’m so sorry! I’m really sorry! I had some unexpected family matters to attend to, and it held me up for a while.”
