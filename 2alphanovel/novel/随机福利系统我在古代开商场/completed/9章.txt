**Stormy Waves**

Yan Xu called for someone to escort Clara Joy and the others back.

Sitting in the carriage, Shu Qingyan turned to Clara Joy and asked, “So, in this life, are you still planning to be a doctor?”

“No.” Clara Joy replied without hesitation, “This time around is different from my past life. There are too many powerful people around. If I manage to cure someone, that’s great, but if I encounter a difficult case, my life could be at stake. Besides, my medical skills weren’t that impressive in my past life; I can’t cure everything. Since I’ve been given a second chance at life, I want to enjoy it a bit more.”

“Well, that might not go as you wish,” Shu Qingyan remarked, her lips forming a slight pout. “Now that you've cured Old Master Yan, you’ll definitely attract attention from others.”

Clara Joy lifted her chin a bit proudly, saying, “You think I’m foolish? I’ve already asked Young Master Yan to help me keep it a secret.”

“When the family gets rich, you and Yuqin can do whatever you want, and I’ll just cling to you both,” Clara Joy said with a playful grin.

“I won’t take care of you!” Shu Qingyan replied, her gaze drifting.

Clara Joy knew her well and leaned in closer, wrapping her arms around Shu Qingyan’s arm and playfully coaxing, “Come on, please take care of me! Just a little kiss?”

Shu Qingyan feigned disgust, but the corner of her mouth betrayed her with a barely noticeable smile.

Shu Yuqin, covering her mouth, watched the two with amusement, but then suddenly her smile faded as she furrowed her brows, lost in thought. “I can only cook; I don’t know how to run a business or interact with others. How am I supposed to make money?”

“That’s easy! You just focus on making delicious food, and I’ll take care of the rest,” Clara Joy said, playfully tapping Shu Yuqin’s forehead.

“But that’s not really me taking care of you,” Shu Yuqin said, looking troubled.

Clara Joy and Shu Qingyan exchanged a glance and burst into laughter; this girl really took things too seriously.

In Wang Family Village, at Wang Yuanyi’s home.

Wang Rong glanced once more toward her mother’s room but still didn’t see the children come out.

“Little sister, your kids have become lazier since they’ve been out. How are they ever going to get married like this?” Tang spoke with a sarcastic tone.

“What are you two gossiping about? Hurry up and get back to work!” Zhou Cuihua emerged from the room and saw Wang Rong and Tang putting down their tasks, seemingly in conversation.

“Mother, it’s already past the hour, and the eldest hasn’t even gotten up. The other girls have already gone out to gather pig grass,” Tang reported, sounding accusatory.

Zhou Cuihua shot a glance at Tang that made her shiver, unsure of what she had said wrong.

“Just focus on your own business and stop meddling in others’ affairs,” Zhou Cuihua replied curtly.

Wang Rong felt a bit embarrassed; while her mother had been nice to the kids lately, they shouldn’t have become this lazy. “Mother, I’ll go wake them up,” she said, lifting her foot to leave.

Zhou Cuihua knew she couldn’t stop this; she followed with a calm gaze, having already thought of what to say.

“Mother, the children aren’t in their room?” Wang Rong’s face was puzzled when she stepped out.

“They’re not in their room? That’s impossible! I didn’t hear any noise this morning and thought they were still asleep!” Zhou Cuihua feigned ignorance.

“Where could they have gone?”

“Little sister, don’t worry. I heard that there are plenty of wild fruits ripening on the mountain. Maybe they went up there,” Zhou spoke as she entered from outside.

“I got up so early and haven’t gone out. If they were out, I would have seen them,” Wang Rong still felt something was off.

“They might have wanted to surprise us by getting up earlier than everyone else,” Zhou suggested.

Wang Rong suddenly felt a wave of anxiety wash over her; she sensed something wasn’t right but couldn’t pinpoint what it was.

Wait!

Wang Rong’s gaze instinctively fell on Zhou Cuihua.

“What are you looking at me for? Those kids are really something; they go off without saying a word,” Zhou Cuihua met Wang Rong’s gaze, her temper flaring.

“Little sister, you’re not doubting Mother, are you? The way Mother acted before was because we lost the children. Though they became ghost brides, the He family will definitely bury them better than we could,” Zhou reprimanded Wang Rong.

“Hey, I’m not the kind of person to let my own children suffer. If that were the case, would they still be around my house now?” Zhou Cuihua said earnestly.

“Mother, I wasn’t implying that, I just…”

“Grandma, with that look, you really do seem like a kind old lady,” a cold voice interrupted Wang Rong.

Zhou Cuihua turned sharply at the familiar voice, and Zhou’s face mirrored her shock.

“You… you all…”

“Is Grandma wondering how we’ve returned?” Clara Joy said, a mocking expression on her face.

“What do you mean by that, Third Sister?” Wang Rong asked, confusion evident on her face, sensing something was wrong.

“Mother should ask Grandma herself; if we tell you, you probably wouldn’t believe us anyway,” Shu Yuqin pouted.

“Mother?” Wang Rong called out.

Zhou Cuihua, realizing the gravity of the situation, grabbed Zhou, who seemed flustered.

“How could I possibly know where you went? We’ve been searching for you all this time!”

“Last night, we sisters were drugged by Grandma and Aunt Er and handed over to the Jia family. Luckily, Young Master Yan saved us, or else…” Clara Joy looked at Wang Rong, squeezing out a couple of tears. “Otherwise, we would never have seen you again. Mother, I was so scared!”

Wang Rong was left in shock, unable to comprehend how her mother could be so cruel.

“Don’t wrong me! I didn’t know anything; I only heard your mother say you hadn’t gotten up this morning,” Zhou Cuihua’s eyes darted around nervously.

“I could hear the commotion from far away. What were you all talking about?”

Clara Joy turned her head, spotting the three men returning from work. The serious-looking head of the family, Wang Yuanyi, was flanked by Wang He and Wang Ming.

Perfect timing; now that the head of the family had returned, it would save her the trouble of explaining again.

Clara Joy decided to cut to the chase. “Grandpa and Uncle are back, and we want to move out.”

Then, without waiting for anyone to respond, Clara Joy recounted the events of the past few days.

“If our family didn’t take you in, you would have died over ten years ago. Letting you live this long and now expecting us to benefit from it is hardly unreasonable,” Uncle Wang Ming blurted out after hearing how much Clara Joy and her sisters could fetch.

The three of them shot him glares before looking back at the family head.

“What your second uncle said is right,” Clara Joy rolled her eyes, realizing that Wang Yuanyi and Zhou Cuihua truly were cut from the same cloth.

“Father, Second Brother, how can you… how can you do this?” Wang Rong was at her wit’s end, sobbing uncontrollably as she looked at her family’s attitude.

“Well, since Grandpa has said so, I must have a good discussion with you all.”
