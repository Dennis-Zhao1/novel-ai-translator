**Death**

Clara Joy felt a pang of sorrow for her sister, knowing that she was deeply troubled. 

“Mom, please get better soon. It’s getting colder, and we’re still waiting for you to make us some clothes!” Clara said, holding onto Wang Rong’s hand as she sat by the bedside. But Wang Rong showed no signs of response.

“You girls should just carry on with your lives. Your mom might need some time to heal,” a gentle voice suggested.

Clara nodded. Their hotpot stall hadn’t opened in days. Luckily, every day, Clara’s other sisters—Ethan Jade and Song Qingqing—were home, so they didn’t have to worry about Wang Rong doing anything rash.

The following day, Clara and her sister Shu Qingyan went to the county to sell skewers. However, as they returned to their village, they noticed the villagers looking at them with pity in their eyes.

“Auntie, what happened?” Clara couldn’t help but ask a woman passing by.

The woman hesitated, then finally replied softly, “My condolences.”

Clara’s heart sank immediately.

Li An, who had overheard the woman, quickened his pace toward Clara's home.

“Get out! Get out of our house!” Clara’s sister Shu Yuqin screamed, her voice filled with anguish.

“Mom, don’t leave us!” 

Outside their thatched-roof house, several people stood, and upon seeing Clara and her sister, they instinctively made way for them.

Clara’s feet felt heavy as she walked inside. 

The sight that met her eyes was devastating: Wang Rong lay still in the courtyard, her eyes shut tight, a pool of blood seeping from her head. Tears streamed down Clara’s cheeks uncontrollably.

Just days ago, Wang Rong had been so determined to protect them.

“You’re back. Mom was killed by them! They did this!” Shu Yuqin pointed accusingly at Zhou Cuihua, who stood to the side.

Clara narrowed her eyes. 

“You little brat, don’t go around making baseless accusations. She fell and hit her head on a rock,” Zhou Cuihua said, her voice shaky.

“Isn’t it because you pushed her?” 

Clara stepped back and found a villager. She pulled out ten coins. “Could you please help us find some officials at the county office?”

She then gave Shu Qingyan a knowing look. 

Shu Qingyan understood immediately, and together they tied up Zhou Cuihua and Zhou Shi with ropes.

“Why didn’t you call the village head?” Clara asked, trying to comfort Shu Yuqin.

“Qingqing went to get him, but the village head happens to be away today.”

“I finally had a mother who cared for me, and now she’s been killed by them!” Shu Yuqin cried, struggling to catch her breath.

“Hey, I’m really sorry, I went back to get you some vegetables when I saw you didn’t have much left. I didn’t know that when I returned, Rongrong would be gone. It’s my fault; I shouldn’t have left,” Chen Ping said, filled with regret.

“Don’t blame Aunt Ping. You don’t need to feel guilty. Right now, we should focus on preparing for the funeral. We’re not experienced in this, so we’ll need your guidance,” Clara said, shaking her head.

“Let us go, you bitches! This has nothing to do with us!” Zhou Cuihua continued to scream, while Zhou Shi stood silently, her face pale with fear.

Shu Qingyan shot a cold, piercing glare at Zhou Cuihua, silencing her with fear, before turning to get a handkerchief and stuffing it into Zhou Cuihua’s mouth.

Since the officials hadn’t arrived yet, Clara and her sisters didn’t dare to move Wang Rong’s body.

Leaving Shu Qingyan behind, Clara followed Li An and Chen Ping to the town to buy what they needed for the funeral.

By the time they returned home, the officials had arrived.

“Here you go, two truth pills for the host,” a voice declared.

“It’s not my fault! I swear it’s not my fault!” Zhou Shi finally reacted upon seeing the officials, repeating the same line over and over.

Meanwhile, Zhou Cuihua continued to defend herself, and while the officials were distracted, Clara quickly slipped a pill into Zhou Cuihua’s mouth.

“I pushed her. She deserved to die. That ungrateful wretch! I only came to mock her because I heard she was sick, and I thought I’d take care of that little brat while the other two were away. But Wang Rong went mad and pushed me out. I lost my balance and accidentally pushed her into the yard. I didn’t expect her to hit her head on a rock and die. I wanted her to suffer, but I didn’t want her to die like this. Those little brats won’t let me off the hook.”

“Officer, my sister and another person who helps out at my house are witnesses. She’s already admitted it, so we don’t need to conduct an autopsy, right?” Clara said, slipping ten taels of silver into the chief officer’s hands.

The officer, initially thinking this trip wouldn’t yield much, was pleasantly surprised by Clara’s savvy.

“Yes, she has already confessed. We will take her away now. As for the follow-up, rest assured that our superior handles matters fairly,” the officer assured.

With Zhou Cuihua and Zhou Shi taken away, Clara and her sisters finally had the chance to clean Wang Rong’s body and dress her in her burial clothes.

Perhaps it was the money, but the next day, they were notified that Zhou Cuihua would be imprisoned for about ten years, while Zhou Shi, having not laid a hand on Wang Rong, would not face any sentencing.

After Wang Rong’s burial, life began to return to normal, though Shu Yuqin struggled to eat, missing their mother dearly. 

Clara and Shu Qingyan decided to have Chen Ping and Song Qingqing handle the skewers at Chen Ping's home, keeping Shu Yuqin close by.

Through this incident, Clara realized that the three of them needed to learn some martial arts. They also needed to earn more money to hire skilled protectors because it seemed trouble always found them.

As time passed, Shu Yuqin gradually emerged from her grief, returning to her usual self. 

Seeing her sister like this brought Clara and Shu Qingyan relief; they had feared that Shu Yuqin would retreat into a shell.

One day, while at their stall, an unexpected guest arrived.

“Are you really that heartless? That was your grandmother!” 

“Heartless? Who can kill their own daughter and still be considered kind?” Clara shot back.

“But Grandma didn’t mean to! She didn’t intentionally push Auntie towards the rock,” Wang Changyu, standing to the side, protested.

“How did you all turn into such cold-hearted people? This is wrong. Girls should be soft and gentle. Do you know how much this affects my career?” 

“Your career has nothing to do with us,” Clara retorted.

“I’m still your cousin! If I succeed, I can definitely help you out,” he added.

Clara shot him a disdainful look, not wanting to hear any more of his hypocritical nonsense.

But Shu Qingyan couldn’t take it anymore and shoved Wang Changyu aside. 

“If you care so much, then go back home and ask your family for money! Maybe your grandmother can get out a few years sooner,” Clara said scornfully.

To her surprise, Wang Changyu actually took her words to heart and went home to speak with his family—not out of concern for Zhou Cuihua, but because he feared his career might be jeopardized. 

Although, ironically, he hadn’t even passed his preliminary exams yet.
