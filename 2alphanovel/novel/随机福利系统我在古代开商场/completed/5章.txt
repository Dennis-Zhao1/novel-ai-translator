**Random Welfare System**

Clara Joy felt a rush of embarrassment as she listened intently to the muffled voices coming from the room, all thanks to Ethan Jade’s insistence that she eavesdrop on the situation. 

“What did you hear?” Clara Joy asked eagerly, almost bouncing on her heels as soon as Ethan Jade lay back on the bed.

“Shh, keep it down. We don’t want to wake Mom,” Clara said, tugging at Clara Joy's sleeve with a worried expression.

Ethan Jade recounted every word she had overheard, including the more scandalous bits at the end. 

Clara Joy couldn't help but chuckle, “I didn’t expect those two to still be so... enthusiastic at their age.” 

“Sis, you can’t just think about that! We need a plan. Or should we tell Mom? That way, she’ll probably let us move out,” Clara said anxiously, biting her fingernails. But as she looked at her two friends, she realized they were far less concerned about the situation.

Clara Joy and Ethan Jade exchanged knowing glances, then turned to Clara with a look of disdain. The unspoken message was clear: After all these centuries of time travel, how was she still so naive?

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Clara asked, perplexed.

“If we tell Mom, do you think she’ll believe us?” Clara Joy inquired patiently. This was just how her best friend was—always a bit oblivious.

Clara recalled how, just that evening, their mother had praised Zhou Cuihua for cooking each of them an egg, going on about how wonderful she was and how she clearly cared about them.

“She wouldn’t believe us,” Clara finally admitted.

“Exactly! She’d probably think we’re just trying to stir up trouble to get out of chores. Even if she did believe us, there’s no way she’d resolve it by tomorrow,” Clara Joy added.

“What do we do then?” Clara frowned. “I finally have a mom, and I don’t want to lose her so soon.”

“We turn the tables on them,” Clara Joy and Ethan Jade said in unison.

“Oh, okay.” Clara nodded, realizing she’d have to trust her friends. After all, their bond had weathered many storms in their past lives.

“Big sis, are those two really... you know? Aren’t they over fifty?” Clara asked, pushing aside her worries and diving into gossip.

“Why not listen in? They’re probably in a passionate mood right now; we’ll definitely hear something,” Clara Joy suggested.

“Oh no, I’d rather not. Ugh, I’m so tired. I need to sleep,” Clara said, her cheeks flushed as she pulled the blanket over herself.

Moments later, Clara poked her head out from under the covers. “Big sis, little sis, do you think Grandma made us eggs tonight because we could make a lot of money? Maybe that’s why she’s in a good mood?”

“Good thinking! You’re so clever!” Clara Joy said, her spirits lifting because of Clara’s insight.

Clara smiled in the dark. “I just thought of it now.”

In their new surroundings, the three sisters had a hard time sleeping. When Wang Rong woke up, they stirred too.

“Get up! There’s a lot of work to do today. If you perform well, maybe Grandma will make you eggs again tonight,” she encouraged.

“Mom, you get up first. We want to sleep a little longer,” Clara Joy mumbled, still half-asleep.

“That’s not happening. I know you’re tired, but if you don’t bring back the pig feed before breakfast, Grandma will get mad,” Wang Rong insisted.

“She won’t be mad today. You go ahead, Mom. We’ll sleep a bit more,” Clara added, feeling confident that Zhou Cuihua wouldn’t be angry on their last day, especially not when money was involved.

Plus, she figured that any guilt Zhou Cuihua might feel, or the fear that they might come back as vengeful spirits, would ensure they were treated well today. They didn’t need to work like beasts this time; they could afford to relax and enjoy a meal.

Wang Rong looked at the sky, realizing she couldn’t put it off any longer. She quickly got on with her chores, finishing her work before tackling the kids' responsibilities.

“Mom, why are you up so early today?” she asked, only to be startled by Zhou Cuihua’s sudden appearance.

“Hmm, where are the girls?” Zhou Cuihua asked, looking bright and chipper.

Wang Rong’s heart raced, unsure how to respond.

“They’re probably still asleep. It’s okay; after everything that happened yesterday, the kids are tired. Don’t wake them. Let them rest. I’ll ask your sister-in-law to buy a chicken to make sure they and Yu'er get a little extra nourishment,” Zhou Cuihua said.

Wang Rong raised her head in disbelief.

“What? Do I look like I’m joking?”

“No, no! Thank you for understanding, Mom. Thank you!” Wang Rong replied, overwhelmed with gratitude.

“Today, do less work and spend more time with them,” Zhou Cuihua instructed.

“Understood!” Wang Rong replied cheerfully.

At the breakfast table, she chewed on the steamed bun Zhou Cuihua had set aside for her, glancing at her mother-in-law, who seemed ready to say something but held back.

“Take more. Make sure the kids each get a bun and an egg,” Zhou Cuihua said, and instantly, everyone except Wang Yuanyi dropped their jaws in shock.

Wang Changyu looked at Zhou Cuihua in confusion. Seeing her in such a good mood, he quickly pulled on Tang’s sleeve, who was about to speak.

Tang usually followed her son’s lead, and even though she was itching to say something, she kept quiet.

“Grandma, the money from the bracelets still has some left over from the embroidered pouches my sister made. Can I take a bun for her?” Wang Changyu suggested.

Hearing his voice made Zhou Cuihua even happier. She glanced at Wang Wan'er, who was dutifully sipping her thin porridge next to Tang, and found her more pleasing to the eye than usual. She picked up the smallest bun and handed it over.

Seeing the big house's theatrics and glancing at her own daughters, Zhou Cuihua, who wasn’t fond of them but disliked the big house even more, felt a twinge of irritation.

“Dear, Si’er is also making embroidered pouches to sell money for you. Can’t we give them a bun too?” she asked, her mood darkening.

“Wait until they’ve actually sold something. They’ve done hardly any work. What right do they have to eat buns?” Zhou Cuihua snapped back.

“Grandma, we won't eat. My sister and I are full. We’re going to go gather firewood now,” Wang Sinan said, hastily finishing the rest of her porridge and pulling Wang Zhaodi to rush out.

After eating the food Wang Rong had brought, the three sisters split up and left. Thanks to Zhou Cuihua's earlier words, Wang Rong didn’t hold them back.

Based on her memories, Clara Joy knew that Song Qingqing was by the river, so she headed there, while Ethan Jade took Clara to the mountains to plan their future escape.

“Qingqing.”

“Three sisters! Why are you here at this hour?” Song Qingqing asked, surprised.

“Because my grandma will secretly send us away tonight, so she’s letting us off the hook today,” Clara explained.

“She’s not planning to marry you off to the He family, is she? It makes sense. She seemed suddenly in a good mood last night and wanted to send Grandma He off. She must be scheming something. How did you find out? Oh no, what are you going to do? That’s a death sentence! You should run!” Song Qingqing said, panicking.

“We’re not running. I came to ask for your help,” Clara said earnestly.

“What do you need?” Song Qingqing asked.

“Help me deliver this letter to Master Yan in the county. He’s the only one who can save us,” Clara replied, her eyes filled with hope.

Without a second thought, Song Qingqing agreed, determined to deliver the letter. After all, Clara was her best friend who had saved her life.

“What’s this for? You need money for me to help you?” Song Qingqing inquired.

“It’s just to explain to your mom. You need a reason to go to the county, right?” Clara replied.

“Ding! Random welfare system bound...” 

“Host has thought of a solution to the current dilemma. Reward: A set of silver needles...” 

“Automatically distributed to you. Please proceed to a secluded area...”
