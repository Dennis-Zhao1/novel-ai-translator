**Paying Back the Debt**

Stepping out of the jewelry store, Stella Lane admired the sapphire necklace she held in her hand, its brilliance catching the sunlight. 

After her purchase, the store clerk mentioned that the sapphire was a royal blue, sourced from a region known for its luxury black tea. The gem was octagon-cut, surrounded by pavé diamonds, each resembling teardrops and quite large. The design was elegant, with an 18k platinum setting featuring a three-dimensional mesh pattern on the back.

The necklace came with a matching platinum chain, and although Stella wanted to wear it, she realized her casual outfit of a short-sleeved top and denim shorts didn't quite match the necklace's elegance.

After enjoying its beauty, Stella carefully tucked the necklace and its certification into her shoulder bag. She was amused to learn that gemstones came with certification. Stella left the store feeling satisfied with her purchase, knowing that in a pinch, she could always sell the necklace online.

**[No way!]**  
**[Items purchased with system funds can be given to others, but you can never return or resell them for money!]**

"Well, that's disappointing," Stella thought. She had planned to use future task funds to invest in gold at a jewelry store, then sell it when prices rose. It seemed that plan was off the table. She certainly wouldn’t give away such an expensive piece of jewelry to anyone!

Since selling it was out of the question, she figured she might as well keep it for herself; after all, she really liked this sapphire necklace.

Next was the system's random task completion lottery. The wheel had eight sections: four for cash, three for physical items, and one for skills.

“System, you promised to help me pay off my debt, right?” Stella asked, a sly smile on her face as she communicated with the system before clicking on the lottery.

**[Ahem!]**  
**[Just keep it to yourself. Don’t bring it up! You’re making things difficult for this system!]**  
The system coughed lightly, giving her a quiet reminder.

Stella didn’t press the system further and made an ‘OK’ sign with one hand, cheerfully responding, “Got it!”

She clicked on the lottery, and the pointer spun wildly before stopping on the cash reward section. A rush of nervous excitement coursed through Stella as she awaited her reward—how much would it be?

**[Congratulations, Stella! You’ve won a cash prize of $15,000!]**  
**[The cash rewards from the lottery are not subject to system rules, so you can use this money however you wish!]**

In other words, this money had no task time limits; she could deposit it in the bank or give it to someone else—she could use it however she liked! The most important thing was that she now had enough money for rent!

As for the debt she owed to Ethan Mason, no dinner could possibly cost $15,000, right?

With her worries resolved, Stella felt a surge of joy, humming a little tune as she skipped forward. Just a few steps later, however, she bent down, clutching her calf.

Ouch!  
One really shouldn’t get too carried away!

……

In a private dining room at the Harbor Hotel, Ethan Mason sat in casual attire, anxiously staring at his phone. The time showed he had ten minutes left until their scheduled meeting.

Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling of worry. He was concerned that Stella might not find her way and anxious that she could face an accident on her way here. Most of all, he feared that Stella would decide not to come because she disliked him.

Regret washed over Ethan; he wished he hadn’t promised Stella not to go to school. If he hadn’t, he could have driven to pick her up and seen her sooner. He even regretted leaving the hospital after she had fallen asleep the night before.

Ever since meeting Stella, Ethan wanted to be with her all the time. Ideally, he wished for a way to tie them together with a rope so they would never have to part again. He had never experienced such anxiety over a relationship before. Was true love meant to be this sweet yet torturous?

The wait for his beloved always felt unbearable, as if every minute stretched into an hour. Ethan pulled out a packet of gum, thinking about chewing to ease his anxiety, but remembering that Stella would soon enter the room, he restrained himself.

He never cared about such things when he was with his past girlfriends.

Stella arrived two minutes early, and the moment Ethan spotted her, all his negative feelings vanished. He stood up and walked over to her, gentlemanly pulling out the chair at the dining table.

“Thank you.”  
Stella expressed her gratitude, feeling that aside from her father, this was the first time a guy had treated her so kindly.

“No need to thank me.”  
Ethan smiled, flashing a bright, charming grin.

After Stella sat down, instead of returning to his own seat, he sat right next to her, causing her to awkwardly shift a little further away. 

In the cozy private room, the two sat across from each other at a round table, one smiling warmly while the other remained silent.

Stella, wanting to avoid Ethan’s intense gaze, focused her eyes on a landscape painting hanging on the wall. Just as he was about to call the waiter to order, she remembered the purpose of her visit here and interrupted, “No need, I’m here to pay back my debt. Once that’s done, I’ll leave.”

“Hmm, we can discuss the money later. Let’s eat first. The other aspects of this place might be lacking, but their specialty cuisine is excellent and good for your legs,” Ethan suggested with a smile.

“No thanks. My legs are feeling much better now; I just want to settle the debt.” Stella insisted stubbornly.

Ethan felt helpless. “Look, the money is already enough. I invited you here to apologize for my rudeness the other day.”

“It’s alright; let’s just forget about that day. I didn’t suffer any harm, and since the money is sufficient, I’ll be on my way.”

After saying that, Stella attempted to get up to leave. However, as she stood, Ethan grabbed her arm.

“What are you doing?”  
Stella tensed up, memories of that night flooding back, and she instinctively tried to pull her arm away. 

Unlike that night, this time, Stella was able to easily free herself with a little force. Once liberated, she turned to leave.

But then she heard Ethan’s voice behind her.  
“The dinner yesterday cost a total of $5,999, so you still owe me $4,999.”

Stella froze in disbelief, spinning around to face him, “Why is it so expensive?!”

Ethan leaned back, arms crossed, looking at her with amusement, “The specialty cuisine you had yesterday was prepared by this hotel. If you don’t believe me, feel free to ask any staff member here about the price.”

Trying to distance himself?  
Looks like you’re out of luck now~

With a smirk, Ethan observed the shocked expression on Stella’s face. He wasn’t lying; while the Harbor Hotel may not match other five-star hotels in terms of facilities and service quality, it was renowned for its specialty cuisine. 

The hotel’s owner, Mr. Jones, had ancestors who were specialized chefs, and the family recipe had built the hotel’s wealth. 

The most expensive dish Stella had the previous day was the braised beef, priced at $4,999. The ingredients were of the highest quality, known for their restorative properties. 

Stella wanted to scream in disbelief!  
The price of just that one dish was higher than her entire year’s worth of living expenses!

She wanted to blame Ethan for buying such an expensive meal for her. But thinking about his status, it was likely that to him, this cuisine was probably just like plain porridge is to ordinary folks.

“Can we sit down and talk now?”  
Ethan asked, seeing Stella’s face grow paler by the second. He felt a pang of sympathy for her. Yet, if he didn’t act, the woman in front of him would be eager to cut ties with him, as if he were some contagious virus.

There was no way he was letting Stella get away that easily!

**[Stella, don’t give him the satisfaction! Hit him with your cash!]**  
The system seethed, disapproving of Ethan's smug demeanor.

“Then I’ll pay through PayPal.”  
Stella tried to appear calm in front of Ethan, but inside, she felt like rolling around in agony.

Debts had to be repaid.  
But just as she’d finally gotten her hands on $15,000, she was now spending nearly a third of it on food, which felt utterly unworthy. 

The jewelry she bought for $15,000 could be worn and admired. But spending almost $5,000 on food, which would ultimately just become part of her bodily cycle, felt like a waste.

Oh, she remembered, it was specialty cuisine.  
So, she could only hope the restorative properties of the food would help her legs heal quickly; they still hurt a bit when she walked.

“...What?”  
Upon hearing Stella’s response, Ethan, who had been so confident just a moment ago, suddenly felt uneasy.

……

In a private room at the “Starlight” club, Ethan, slightly tipsy, held a bottle of whiskey, his gaze fixated on his phone as if he wanted to burn a hole through the screen.

He occupied an entire couch by himself, while others in the room were either dancing with their partners or playing silly drinking games, painting a picture of a group of young professionals living it up without a care in the world.

“Ethan, what are you looking at? Waiting for your girlfriend’s call?”  
Ryan leaned over, curious.

What’s with this serious demeanor? 

“Yeah, waiting for a call that will never come.”  
Ethan chuckled self-deprecatingly and gulped down more whiskey.

“Did you have a fight with her?” Ryan inquired.

“A fight? She just avoids me and won’t see me.”  
Ethan took another swig.

“Wait, are you two broken up?” Ryan asked, surprised.

“Broken up?”  
Ethan scoffed, “It would be better if we had! At least we would have been together! I haven’t even seen her smile once; am I that bothersome?”

Ryan was dumbfounded. It sounded like Ethan had been dumped by that ordinary-looking girl! 

But wait!  
Ethan’s words implied they had never even been together!

This wasn’t right!  
The charming girl shouldn’t have let go of Ethan while he was still interested in her!

Wasn't the strategy of ‘wanting what you can’t have’ supposed to work the other way around?

At that moment, Ethan suddenly threw down his whiskey bottle and grabbed Ryan by the collar, “Ryan, am I really that unlikable?”

You are quite unlikable!  
But when you give benefits to those around you, you’re quite popular, like the foolish son of the local landlord who keeps losing money.

Ryan grumbled in his mind but said aloud, “Impossible! Which woman sees you and doesn’t want to cling to you like a shadow?”

“But she doesn’t!”  
Ethan shot Ryan a glare, reprimanding him, “Can’t you use a better metaphor? What’s with the shadow?”

“Uh, Ethan, you know my academic performance isn’t great. My literary skills are lacking, and my degree was bought with my dad’s money. Please bear with me.”  
Ryan pleaded, while in his heart, he thought his description was quite apt.

Those women were all after Ethan’s money, right?  
They wanted to latch onto him, to soak up his wealth! 

Some might even be after his looks, as Ethan was quite charming, and some women would rather have him than money!

America is vast and rich; there are many wealthy women.  
If Ethan didn’t have money, he could definitely make a living with his looks!

“Ryan, what do you think love really is?”  
Ethan slumped back on the couch, questioning Ryan, who stood beside him.

What’s with the sudden philosophical questioning?  
Ryan thought for a moment before sharing his own thoughts on love: “Love is like my relationship with Sarah. We’re in love!”

“Bullshit!”  
As soon as Ryan finished, Ethan shot back with disdain.

“Ethan, what do you mean by that?”  
Ryan felt a bit offended.

Ethan shrugged nonchalantly, “Ryan, have you forgotten how you met Sarah?”

A woman who actively joined their gathering couldn’t possibly have a genuine relationship with Ryan!  
Don’t tarnish the word!

“...True! My first meeting with her wasn’t exactly honorable, but since then, she’s been the only woman for me, and I for her. We’re in a real relationship now, heading towards marriage!”  
Ryan stubbornly defended himself.

“Ha!”  
Ethan scoffed again, continuing, “You two will break up sooner or later; you won’t get married.”

Every time he ran into Sarah at gatherings, she would purposely flirt with him, shooting him glances, which made Ethan realize she didn’t take Ryan seriously at all. 

But he was surprised to learn that they had been dating for two years. 
Did Ryan just not see her flirty behavior, or did he willingly ignore it?

Two years isn’t that long; there are couples that break up after ten years!  
Maybe he should give a little hint, so they could break up sooner and Ryan could relieve himself of that burden?

Ethan never imagined he would be looking out for Ryan while giving him advice, but Ryan didn’t appreciate it, as if Ethan had touched a nerve, and he shot back, “Ethan, don’t think about me and Sarah; you can’t make it work with that girl either!”

“What do you mean by that?”  
Ethan shot Ryan a dangerous glare, thinking this kid had gotten too bold!

Ryan felt a shiver run through him from Ethan’s dangerous gaze, but he couldn’t hold back his frustration and blurted out what he had heard from others behind Ethan’s back regarding Sarah’s thoughts.

Of course, he didn’t mention that Sarah had said it. 

“Damn you!”  
Hearing Ryan's remarks about Stella, Ethan jumped up from the couch and landed a left hook to Ryan’s right cheek, knocking the hefty man to the ground.
