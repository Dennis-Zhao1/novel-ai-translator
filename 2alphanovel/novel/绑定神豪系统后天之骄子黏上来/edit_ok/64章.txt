**Crazy Spending**

Three plastic surgeons carefully assessed the facial features of Ivy and her friends. In their opinion, Ivy, Melanie, and Kate could benefit from minor cosmetic enhancements, such as eyelid surgery or non-invasive nose injections, while Claire and the rest were naturally well-endowed and only needed subtle facial treatments to enhance their looks.

Dr. Smith, renowned for his expertise in wrinkle removal and dermal fillers, observed that Claire's hollow cheeks were due to her being underweight rather than a natural trait. He kindly suggested she consider gaining a bit of weight for a healthier appearance.

Stella, the group’s manager, took note of the suggestions while the team exchanged glances, realizing that Claire's slim figure was a bit too striking. It might be time for her to consider putting on a few pounds.

After this, Stella scheduled full-body skin treatments for the group at a renowned clinic, using company funds for the artists' procedures as a business investment. However, she planned to pay for her personal treatments with her own money.

Just then, Stella received a notification from her Celestial Fortune System: 

**[Today's Task: Spend $15,000 in 30 minutes!]**

**[Weekly Task: Spend $5 million in 10 hours!]**

Momentarily taken aback, Stella turned to the plastic surgeons and asked, "Do you offer membership packages here?"

The day before, she had drawn a special card from the system, granting her a one-day extension for tasks and special items. She decided to save it for the right moment.

"Yes, Ms. Ling," Dr. Smith replied. "Would you like to sign up?"

"Absolutely," Stella nodded.

Within ten minutes, the surgeons were astounded. Stella had secured memberships across their clinics with a total limit equivalent to several million dollars!

"My goodness!" Dr. Smith murmured, clutching his chest as if his heart might burst. The extravagant spending made him and his colleagues wonder about opportunities in the U.S.

With a bit more to spend on the task, Stella transferred the remaining funds to the company's account, similar to what she had done with a previous task.

Upon completing the weekly task, Stella received a system lottery chance. The wheel spun and landed on a 5-minute usage right for an American Express Black Card.

Stella's eyes sparkled. "Let's schedule the surgeries for tomorrow," she said, remembering other matters that needed her attention.

"Of course!" Dr. Smith agreed, with the other surgeons nodding eagerly, keen to accommodate such a valuable client.

The Black Card had limitations back home, but not overseas! With the one-day time extension card, Stella could extend the 5-minute Black Card usage to a full day, allowing her to spend freely.

She briefly considered purchasing property abroad, but the requirements for a criminal record clearance certificate made her abandon the idea.

Her team seemed puzzled about Stella's plans as she led them to Signiel Seoul, a seven-star hotel. Presenting her Black Card, she requested the manager.

"Ms. Ling, how may we assist you today?" the manager asked, switching to English for her convenience.

"I’d like to rent three luxury presidential suites for five years," Stella said.

The manager nodded eagerly and quickly arranged the booking, knowing the prestige of a Black Card holder.

As she confirmed the booking, Stella turned to her team. "We’re moving here tonight."

They nodded, still trying to wrap their minds around such lavish spending.

Stella felt a mix of frustration and exhilaration. The Black Card's restrictions back home forced her hand abroad, but she embraced the opportunity.

Next, they visited luxury boutiques where Stella, with the Black Card, bought numerous high-end items. She instructed the manager, "Pack everything suitable for me and my friends and ship it home."

The manager quickly obliged, treating Stella and her team with utmost care.

As they moved from store to store, Stella's team was astounded. Could they ever repay such an investment?

Park, one of the team members, was particularly awed. She had never seen such extravagant spending, even in her country's entertainment industry.

If Stella were asked, she would admit uncertainty about recouping the investment. But with the system's financial support, she planned to invest in promising companies back home eventually.

As night fell, Stella, accompanied by her security detail, explored more luxury stores.

The thrill of shopping was exhilarating, and Stella felt a sense of duty to invest in her team’s image for their future debut.

Later, she made her way to a car dealership, ordering several luxury cars for her team back home.

By dawn, Stella was exhausted but determined not to waste the Black Card’s potential. She woke her team for custom haute couture fittings, ensuring they were dressed for success.

Luxury fashion houses often required stringent client thresholds, but the Black Card granted Stella access to bespoke services.

After fittings, Stella leased a prominent local gym for performances, ensuring her artists would have prime venues for their future shows.

In the end, Stella’s whirlwind spending spree was an investment in her team's success, ensuring they’d shine brightly on the global stage.
