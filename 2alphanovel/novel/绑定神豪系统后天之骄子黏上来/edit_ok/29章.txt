**Merit**

Stella Lang was busy rifling through her closet, trying to find the perfect outfit for a casual dinner with friends.

After trying on several outfits, she found each one felt too formal for the occasion. Stella knew it was just a small gathering, and she could dress more casually. But the thought of Ethan Carter possibly being there made her reach for the dressier options usually saved for special events.

Feeling frustrated with her indecision, Stella turned to her assistant, "Can you help me pick something more laid-back?"

"Of course," the assistant replied, hiding a sigh. Hadn't Stella just dismissed her earlier suggestions? Now she wanted her help again.

After a few more attempts, they finally settled on an outfit Stella approved of—a smart yet relaxed ensemble.

As she buttoned a pair of emerald cufflinks onto her black shirt, Stella asked, "Did we resolve that trending topic issue?"

"Yes, it was handled this morning. Here, take a look at the clarification video," her assistant said, handing over a tablet.

The video cleared up the misunderstanding, but as Stella watched the final scene, a flash of anger crossed her eyes. She turned to her assistant, "Remove the woman in the last scene, and delete that segment entirely. We can't leave any traces online."

"Uh, okay! I'll do it right away!" the assistant stammered, surprised by Stella’s sudden anger.

Why was the usually calm Stella so upset? The tech team had left that part in to highlight the malice of the influencer, but she clearly wasn't pleased.

"One more thing," Stella called out as her assistant reached the door.

"What is it?" she asked, bracing herself for more instructions.

"Dig deeper into that influencer's background. If there's any incriminating evidence, gather it and take it to the authorities," Stella ordered, her voice icy.

The assistant shivered. This influencer must have really crossed the line with Stella to provoke such a response. But then again, maybe it was deserved.

"But Stella, some people have already figured out who you are. If we keep digging into the influencer's past, won't it seem like you're being too harsh?" the assistant suggested cautiously.

"Don't worry about public opinion. Just do as I say," Stella replied nonchalantly, adjusting her collar.

"Understood." The assistant nodded, knowing she had no choice but to follow orders. Besides, if the influencer's actions were criminal, it was her own doing. They were just bringing the truth to light, not spreading rumors.

Still, the assistant felt uneasy. She worried that once the influencer's past was exposed, people might see Stella as cold-hearted. The discussion could devolve into attacks on her family.

It seemed important to shape the narrative so the influencer appeared the architect of her own downfall, avoiding the impression that Stella was pulling the strings.

At six o'clock that evening, outside the Lang Building, a sleek black sedan pulled up.

Stella stepped out, straightening her outfit and taking a deep breath before heading inside. With plenty of guests expected, she had reserved the entire building for the dinner.

Inside, she was greeted by Mr. Parker from "Snow White" Cosmetics, who had been waiting at the entrance. He approached her enthusiastically, struggling a bit with English as they exchanged pleasantries.

Stella responded casually, following him to their reserved room.

Once inside, she scanned the room for a familiar face. To her disappointment, the person she hoped to see wasn't there.

Before she could express her dismay, Mr. Parker called over two young women to introduce. "Stella, this is Amy Zhang, our head of marketing, and this is our translator, Lily Wang."

Stella glanced at the young woman in a soft yellow dress standing beside Amy, then asked, "Is Lisa Clark here?"

"Uh, um..." Amy hesitated. "Oh, she took a leave today for personal reasons."

"What kind of reasons? Is she okay? How was she when she left?" Stella fired off questions, anxiety bubbling up.

What if Lisa found out Stella had followed her that day?

Noticing Stella's worry, Amy quickly reassured her, "No, she didn't seem unwell. She probably just had things to handle."

"I can call her and ask her to come by," she offered, reaching for her phone.

Stella stopped her immediately, "No need! If she's busy, let's not disturb her."

Her heart was heavy with disappointment at not seeing Lisa, coupled with fear that Lisa might discover her past actions. She felt foolish for not approaching Lisa more thoughtfully; her impatience had led to the influencer scandal and its online fallout.

Sensing Stella's unease, Amy couldn't help but pry, "So, do you know Lisa?"

"Yes, we're friends," Stella replied with a smile, adding, "The rumors online were actually shared with me by her."

Lily, who had been quietly listening, suddenly couldn't hold back. She interjected, "But I was the one who found that video! I told Lisa about it! I even got other colleagues involved!"

Stella's eyes widened in surprise as Lily's outburst shattered the room's calm. Amy quickly leaned in, urging Lily to quiet down.

Stella felt embarrassed for both of them. Lisa had told her that a colleague had found the video and sent it to her directly. How could they contradict that?

Realizing Lisa's identity as the praised colleague, Amy thought perhaps Stella was intentionally keeping things under wraps to surprise Lisa later.

Stella smiled at the overzealous Lily and calmly stated, "I know. Lisa mentioned her colleague found the video, but she sent it to me on her own. She was just helping out."

Lily felt a surge of frustration. She wanted to shout that she had discovered the video first! Why was Lisa getting all the credit?

She had left countless comments on the influencer's video! Lisa only got ahead because she had Stella's contact! If Lily had it too, she would have sent the video directly!

She felt aggrieved, wondering why things weren't going as she had hoped.

Mr. Parker looked between them in confusion, trying to follow along. Could they slow down? He couldn't keep up!

With Lisa absent, Stella continued chatting with Mr. Parker for a while before excusing herself, citing other matters to attend to, and leaving the Lang Building.

Back in the car, she turned to her assistant, "Is the video issue resolved?"

"Yes, that part's been deleted," the assistant confirmed.

As they drove off, Stella instructed, "Take me to the Language Institute instead of home."

"Got it, ma'am," the driver replied.

…

Meanwhile, Lisa Clark was busy apartment hunting with her landlord.

She was considering a place in the heart of the city, in a community called Sunny Gardens. It was a spacious high-rise with three bedrooms, two living rooms, and two bathrooms, directly rented from the owner.

"The location is fantastic! The park is right next door, perfect for exercise," the landlord pointed out enthusiastically.

"The apartment is fully furnished with brand new appliances. The monthly rent is $4,000, with a one-month deposit and three months paid upfront. If you're interested, we can sign today, and you can move in right away."

"Sounds great, I'll take it," Lisa agreed.

They had just gone through the apartment, checking every corner and all the appliances. Everything was new and fresh, and Lisa felt satisfied with her choice.

"Great! Let's sign the contract!" the landlord beamed, pulling out two copies from her bag.

After signing, Lisa immediately transferred $16,000 to the landlord's account, who was thrilled to have finally rented out the property.

The extra income was a nice bonus!

After receiving the keys and bidding farewell to the landlord, Lisa closed the door and asked her system, "Can you check if there are any surveillance cameras in this apartment?"
