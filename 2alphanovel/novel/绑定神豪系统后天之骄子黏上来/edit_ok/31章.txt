Chapter 1: Unexpected Encounters

Stella Hart took a deep breath as she glanced back at the two men who seemed ready to clash at any moment. The tension between them was palpable, like a storm brewing on the horizon. Deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, she quickly made her way back to her new rented apartment, clutching her crossbody bag close as if it might shield her from the chaos. Her heart raced with uncertainty as she hurried through the school gate.

"Hey, system, what's the deal with Ethan and Lucas? Are they really drawn to me because of this Fortune System thing?" she pondered, her mind buzzing with questions.

[...Yes, but it’s not entirely that simple.] The system's response was cryptic, and it only added to her frustration.

"What do you mean, not entirely?!" Stella muttered under her breath, her annoyance growing as she picked up the pace.

By the time Stella reached her apartment, the system's ambiguous reply still echoed in her mind. She sank into the couch, her living room quiet except for the soft purr of the cat-like system creature perched on the coffee table, its large eyes watching her intently.

"So you're telling me both Ethan and Lucas are considered Heaven's Chosen Ones?" Stella asked, struggling to wrap her head around the idea. "Are they genuinely interested in me, or is this some kind of elaborate game?"

The little cat nodded earnestly, as if trying to reassure her.

Stella's heart sank as she recalled the video clips making rounds on social media, linking her to Ethan. Was he actually following her around, just like Lucas? The thought sent a shiver down her spine, tarnishing her earlier admiration for Ethan.

"Let's put Ethan aside for now. Are you sure Lucas is a Heaven's Chosen One?" Stella scoffed. "He seems more like a troublemaker than anything else."

The little cat nodded vigorously, clearly agreeing with her assessment. It, too, found Lucas an unlikely candidate for a Heaven's Chosen One.

Stella's thoughts drifted back to unsettling memories from the karaoke bar. The idea of being tangled up with someone like Lucas was unnerving. Yet, it seemed his fixation on her was somehow linked to the system's side effects, making her an unwitting participant in this odd situation.

With a heavy sigh, Stella sank deeper into the couch, feeling overwhelmed. After some contemplation, she made a firm decision. "System, let's unbind. You can take back all the money."

The system's side effects seemed as menacing as an ancient curse. The notion that ordinary people could be inexplicably drawn to her was absurd, even if it promised some kind of benefit. Stella's moral compass simply wouldn't allow it.

"Unfortunately, once bound, the system cannot be unbound," the little cat said, its expression solemn.

"Why did you bind me without asking? And give me such side effects? That feels terribly unfair!" Stella retorted, feeling a mix of indignation and helplessness.

The little cat's eyes welled up with tears, and it leaped into Stella's lap. "Do you dislike me now, Stella?" it asked, its voice trembling.

Stella's heart softened as she wiped away its tears. "I don't dislike you. It's just the idea of being pursued by Heaven's Chosen Ones that I can't stand."

She had only known the little system creature for a week, but it had already become a part of her life. After losing her family, living alone had been a lonely existence, and the system had brought some much-needed brightness into her days. The financial support was helpful, but it was the companionship she truly valued.

"Stella, the truth is, being pursued by Heaven's Chosen Ones isn't entirely a side effect of the system," the little cat explained, its mood lifting now that it knew Stella didn't hate it.

"I chose you not just because you desired money," it continued. "Many people want wealth. The reason I chose you is that you have strong luck!"

"Strong luck? What does that mean?" Stella asked, puzzled.

"You have an exceptional aura of fortune, a high luck value. You're that kind of person, which is why I bound you!"

"That's impossible!" Stella exclaimed. "If I really had strong luck, why did my family pass away so early, leaving me all alone? And why did I live in poverty before meeting you?"

The logic didn't add up.

The system persisted in its explanation. "Your strong luck will begin to manifest when you turn 23. By next year, during your zodiac year, your fortune will peak!"

"Ethan and Lucas are Heaven's Chosen Ones, favored by fortune. But you are a Heaven's Chosen Woman, with luck far surpassing theirs."

"You're like luck in human form, naturally attracting their attention."

"Ordinary people can't handle the system's binding because they lack the virtue to match their position. Only those with strong luck can endure it."

"I didn't tell you before because I feared you'd reject it, thinking I was lying."

"Even without binding me, your strong luck would have drawn Ethan and Lucas to you."

"I'm not lying!" The little cat assured her, puffing out its chest proudly.

Stella was left speechless, realizing she was indeed exceptional, which was why the system had chosen her.

"Then why did you initially say that being pursued by Heaven's Chosen Ones was a side effect of the system?" she asked, still confused.

The little cat scratched its head. "Isn't that what most people dream of? I thought if I framed it as a side effect, you'd be happy and like me even more."

Stella blinked, momentarily at a loss for words.

The system had a point. She had once daydreamed of a charming and talented partner. But that had been a youthful fantasy.

In reality, if an extraordinary person pursued her, she'd eventually question their motives. She'd wonder what they wanted. Perhaps an unknown inheritance was involved?

Now Stella understood that Ethan and Lucas were drawn to her because of her strong luck. Rather than pursuing her, they were chasing the luck itself.

"Is there any way to resolve this situation?" she asked, seeking a solution. The idea of being followed wasn't appealing, even if they were attractive and accomplished.

"Hmm, I could add a skill to the system's lottery to conceal your luck. If you draw this skill, it will prevent them from chasing you. But it will be quite challenging to obtain," the little cat explained.

"Why would it be hard if I have strong luck?" Stella inquired, confused.

"And besides, don't you usually give me what I want?" she added playfully.

"Cough, cough! Let's not be too forward! If the higher-ups find out, I'll be in trouble!" the little cat coughed awkwardly. "The skill is hard to draw because your luck is immense!"

"Think about how powerful a skill would need to be to conceal such luck. It's bound to be challenging!"

"But don't worry. As your task completion rate increases, your luck value for drawing will improve, and you'll eventually get it!" The little cat gave Stella a thumbs-up, encouraging her.

Stella forced a smile, realizing she'd have to endure this situation a bit longer...

Also, how was this high-tech system mixed with metaphysical luck?

"Isn't metaphysics just advanced science? Do you think high-tech realms lack these concepts?" the little cat replied, crossing its arms.

"As for my realm, I can't disclose more. If I do, I'll be summoned back," it added gravely.

Stella, alarmed at the thought of losing the little cat, immediately straightened up. "Okay, I won’t ask anymore! Let's get some sleep. I'm exhausted."

The information overload left her drained. She lay back on the couch, which was surprisingly comfortable.

Remembering she hadn’t brought a change of clothes, she decided to take half a day off work tomorrow.

Just as she was about to drift off, her phone buzzed, jolting her awake.

It was a message from her friend, Anna.

"Stella, those two guys almost came to blows! Luckily, I got the dorm manager to step in before it got ugly!"

Anna had attached a photo of Ethan and Lucas facing off outside the dorm, both looking ready to fight.

"Stella, who are they? They don't seem like students. One said he was your friend? Is that true?"

After a moment of thought, Stella replied, "No, I'm not familiar with them. I'm living off-campus now, so they probably won't cause more trouble at school."

"Honestly, it doesn't matter if they do. If they come back, it'll just be entertainment. I'm just worried they'll keep bothering you." Anna sent a worried face emoji.
