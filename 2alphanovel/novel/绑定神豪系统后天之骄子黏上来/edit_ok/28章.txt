**House Hunting Adventures**

After diving into some insightful videos, Stella felt genuinely happy for Ethan Clark. She quickly searched for the account of a notorious online influencer, only to find it had been banned for spreading false information. Yet, the drama she had stirred up was still available for all to see.

As Stella clicked on the last controversial video, she found herself engrossed in the comments section, which buzzed with heated debates. The online community had clearly united in defense of Ethan, denouncing the influencer’s antics.

“Wow, she’s really making a mountain out of a molehill! Just because Ethan didn’t add her on social media? That's no reason to throw a tantrum online,” one user commented.

“Exactly! Her actions are both reckless and irresponsible,” another chimed in.

“Having such a large following, she should know better than to misuse her influence like this,” someone else added.

Stella couldn’t help but agree with the masses. She scrolled through the comments, chuckling at the banter and the occasional witty retort.

“I never understood why she was popular. Her content never had any real substance,” remarked a skeptical viewer.

“People are finally seeing through her facade now,” Stella thought, nodding along.

The comments continued to pour in, with many expressing relief that the truth had come to light thanks to Ethan’s quick clarification. Some even speculated about the possible legal consequences the influencer might face for her actions.

As the online chatter unfolded, Stella’s curiosity piqued when she noticed a flood of comments about an apology video from the platform’s CEO. Intrigued, she navigated away from the comments to find the video herself.

In the video, a middle-aged man, presumably the CEO, addressed the viewers with a sincere apology. He acknowledged the negative impact the incident had on Ethan and promised to implement stricter measures to prevent similar situations in the future.

“Did anyone else notice how the CEO prioritized Ethan in his apology?” a top comment highlighted.

Stella smiled knowingly. Ethan’s position as a successful entrepreneur was no secret to her. The online community was astute, indeed.

“Ethan’s definitely not someone to mess with,” Stella mused as she read through the comments. Many speculated about Ethan’s background, with some even hinting at his influential connections.

Reflecting on her own encounter with Ethan, Stella found it curious that someone of his stature would want to connect with her. She wondered why he’d gone out of his way to add her on social media when he had turned down the influencer so decisively.

Her musings were interrupted as her lunch break ended, and she returned to her workday. Later, as the day wound down, her colleague, Amy, mentioned a company dinner linked to their partnership with Ethan’s company.

Considering her plans to explore housing options after work, Stella declined the invitation, citing prior commitments. Amy was understanding, knowing Stella would soon be leaving the company.

After clocking out, Stella headed to her favorite dessert shop. Settling into a cozy corner with a slice of mango mousse cake and a cup of coffee, she opened a real estate app to begin her search for a new home.

Stella’s criteria were clear: a modest yet comfortable space in the city center. After some browsing, she found a promising listing for a 1750-square-foot condo in a desirable area and decided to call for details.

“Hello, this is Lisa from Platinum Properties. How can I assist you today?” came a friendly voice on the other end.

“I’m interested in purchasing a property,” Stella replied, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety.

“Great! Do you have local residency or proof of five years of continuous tax payments in the city?” Lisa inquired.

“Uh, no, I don’t have either,” Stella admitted, sensing a hurdle.

“I’m sorry, but those are necessary for purchasing here unless you’re a local resident,” Lisa explained, her tone still polite but less enthusiastic.

After ending the call, Stella quickly researched the home-buying requirements for non-residents. To her dismay, she realized she was far from qualifying to purchase a home in the city.

“Well, if buying isn’t an option, I can always rent,” Stella resolved, her spirits lifting slightly as she considered the flexibility renting could offer.

She remembered a reward she once received that might have offered a property but realized it wouldn’t help her current situation. With renewed determination, Stella reviewed her rental options, ready to take the next step toward finding her own place in the city.
