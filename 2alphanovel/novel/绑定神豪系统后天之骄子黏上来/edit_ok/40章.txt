**Chapter 1: The Quest for Talent**

Stella Johnson was thrilled to put her new business plans into action. She aimed to launch an entertainment company in the heart of the city, inspired by the American pop phenomenon of forming girl groups and boy bands. Stella was determined to discover promising talent and mold them into stars.

Searching online, Stella located several entertainment hubs in New York City where aspiring performers often gathered. Her plan was to casually mingle and scout for potential recruits for her future agency.

Around seven in the evening, Stella slipped into her favorite jeans and jacket, left her cozy apartment, and took an Uber to a bustling area known for its vibrant nightlife. She had read that many talent agencies were based here, and fans often flocked to catch a glimpse of rising stars.

Once there, Stella strolled along the lively streets before stepping into a trendy café filled with young, energetic patrons. The atmosphere was electric with creativity and ambition, and it seemed the perfect place to spot future talent.

Ordering a latte, Stella chose a seat with a good view of the room, her eyes landing on a group of five young women animatedly chatting at a nearby table. Stella's instincts kicked in as she evaluated them with her keen eye for talent.

“Potential Score: 4.8, 3.6, 5, 4.9… 1.9,” she mentally noted, feeling a twinge of disappointment. The highest score was still far from what she hoped to find.

Sipping her coffee, Stella shifted her focus to another table, where three boys and four girls were gathered. The girls seemed promising, but the boys' eclectic styles threw her off slightly.

She assessed the girls: “4.1, 3.9, 5.4, 2.8—still no pass.”

Then, she looked at the boys: one with bangs obscuring his eyes, another with a unique dreadlock style, and a third with strikingly white hair.

“4.1, 6!… 2.” Stella was surprised by one passing score but dismissed the idea of recruiting the guy with dreadlocks. She needed candidates with scores of at least 8 or 9 to truly stand out.

“5, 6.2, 3.3…”

“5.7, 4.7, 1.3—ugh!”

As Stella surveyed the room, her anxiety grew. She’d almost assessed everyone and found only two with passing scores, none of whom met the high potential she was seeking.

“Hey, what’s got you so focused?” A curious male voice interrupted her thoughts.

Stella turned and her heart skipped a beat—an 8!

She studied the man more closely but felt disheartened. He dressed stylishly but seemed rather ordinary, much like herself. Plus, he appeared to be in his thirties, which was older than most fresh talent in the industry.

Stella was puzzled. The entertainment industry often prioritized youth and appearance, so how could this unremarkable man score so high?

As she considered him, four words popped into her mind: **Music Producer**.

That explained it. In music, talent could outshine appearance.

Stella stood up, smiling, eager to engage. “Who are you?”

The man, taken aback by her directness, stepped back slightly and laughed awkwardly, “No need to be nervous! I was just curious about the numbers you were muttering.”

Recognizing a potential ally, Stella decided to be upfront. “I’m scouting for talent.”

“Oh, so you’re a talent scout?” he guessed, realizing she was assessing the crowd.

“Not exactly. I’m planning to start an entertainment company,” Stella explained, inviting him to join her.

Intrigued, the man sat across from her, noting Stella's stylish attire and the gleaming jewelry she wore—a platinum necklace with blue stones and a striking ruby ring. It was clear she had the means to back her ambition.

“Are you planning to open your company here in New York?” he asked.

Stella shook her head. “No, I’m looking to recruit talent here but plan to establish my company elsewhere.”

The man looked puzzled. “Why not here? New York is a cultural hub!”

Indeed, New York City was a melting pot of art and talent, making it an ideal place for an entertainment company. But Stella had her reasons.

“I have my reasons,” she said, not wanting to elaborate further. She knew the competition was fierce and had strategic plans in mind.

Sensing her reluctance, the man didn’t press further. “Why not recruit from art schools?” he suggested, changing the topic.

Stella considered this. “It seems too complicated.”

“With the recent changes in the industry, many companies can’t debut their talent as easily. Those well-trained but stuck without opportunities are the ones I’m targeting.”

Recruits from art schools would require years of training, and Stella wanted to hit the ground running. She aimed to snatch up talent that was already polished.

The man seemed surprised. “That’s going to cost a lot!”

Entertainment companies invested heavily in training, and buying out contracts could be expensive.

“Money isn’t an issue. If they’re the right fit, I’ll pay what it takes to bring them on board,” Stella said confidently.

The man was impressed by her boldness and willingness to take risks. He realized she was serious about her venture.

Leaning closer, he whispered, “But you won’t find what you’re looking for here. At this hour, those out with friends are usually just ‘scene chasers’—they’re not committed, and no amount of talent will help if they lack dedication.”

“Scene chasers?” Stella echoed, intrigued.

“Yeah, not a flattering term. It’s no wonder the potential scores here are low. Even if two passed, without dedication, they’ll never reach their full potential.”

He chuckled, “These folks might be unwinding after a long day, but the real hustlers are at nearby bars—small-time artists, singers, actors, and models.”

“They’re out socializing, thinking it’s great for networking.”

“Why do they go out for drinks every night?” Stella asked.

“They believe it’s about making connections. The more people they know, the more opportunities they get.”

“If they happen to meet a big shot, they see it as their chance to shine.”

“Big names enjoy the attention. Some seasoned pros will tell newcomers that to get ahead, they need to build relationships.”

The emphasis he placed on ‘relationships’ made Stella understand the implications all too well: it was about using personal connections to advance, no matter the means.

He continued, “For many young talents, they’d rather party than put in the hard work. The industry sends a mixed message that talent doesn’t matter as much as connections, leading many to lose focus.”

“In their circles, no one talks about skills or insights; it’s all about resources and connections. Few take the time to hone their craft.”

“Most arrived with dreams of success, but now…” He shook his head, “Talk to them about aspirations and they look at you like you’re crazy.”

“Do you talk to them?” Stella asked.

“Of course! I’m a music producer and have taught a few trainees. Most are just lazy and uninterested in learning.”

His words served as a warning to Stella: even experienced trainees could be mired in a complacent mindset.

“Where do you think I should go to find dedicated talent?” she inquired.

“Definitely the dance studios in entertainment companies. But you can’t just waltz in and recruit. You can wait here until around ten; the ones leaving late practice are usually the dedicated ones.”

“Some even head to another practice after that. They’re the rare gems.”

Stella realized she’d have to wait until late to find the truly committed ones. Her talent-spotting instincts would need to adapt.

To thank him for his insights, Stella treated him to a late-night meal at a local diner.

He accepted, eager to learn more about her ambitious plans.

After dinner, they exchanged contact information. Stella expressed interest in having him join her venture, but he politely declined, preferring to stay with his current agency and continue his work.

Stella understood; she was still building her dream, while he had an established career.

The next evening, just before ten, Stella returned to the bustling area. The dance studios were alive with activity as trainees practiced, dedicated to their craft. 

Holding a warm cup of coffee, she watched from the café window, hoping to spot the future stars emerging from the studios.
