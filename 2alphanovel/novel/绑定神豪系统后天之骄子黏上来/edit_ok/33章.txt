**The Elegance of a Rich Girl**

"I—I don’t believe it!" 

Wang Lingling shouted defiantly, her earlier bravado now replaced with a more subdued demeanor. Even if her two male colleagues released her arms, she wouldn’t lash out like a wildcat any longer.

"Enough!" 

A stern voice cut through the air.

Turning towards the source, Stella Ling saw Emma Carter, who had stepped out of her office, her expression hard as she glared at Wang Lingling.

"Wang Lingling, do you think this office is your personal playground?" 

"I won't even address your work attitude right now. If we hadn't gone to the same college, I wouldn't have tolerated a subordinate who thrives on causing drama! You have two choices: take some time off to reflect and return on the 16th of this month, or clear out your desk and leave."

Emma Carter pointed sharply towards the door as she spoke to Wang Lingling.

"Emma!" 

Wang Lingling protested, feeling singled out. Why was she being reprimanded when Stella had also been involved in the argument? Did Emma fear Stella’s real connections and target her instead?

Seeing Wang Lingling’s resistance, Emma Carter, already frustrated, fixed her gaze on Wang Lingling, reiterating with emphasis, "Take time off to reflect or pack your things and leave. Which will it be?"

Wang Lingling bit her lip, unwilling to answer.

"Hurry up and decide!" Emma Carter insisted.

Her patience was wearing thin; if Wang Lingling kept stalling, she’d fire her on the spot!

It was one thing to lose face at last night's dinner—after all, the room was filled with senior management, and they wouldn’t spread gossip among the staff. But seeing Wang Lingling create a scene now was intolerable!

"I'll go home and think about it."

Startled by Emma's authority, Wang Lingling quickly conceded.

With a reluctant air, she returned to her desk, wiping her tears as she packed her phone and makeup case into her bag.

As soon as Wang Lingling exited the company, Emma Carter turned to the remaining onlookers and scolded, "Show's over, folks! Back to work!"

The crowd scattered like startled birds.

"Stella, come to my office."

Stella Ling, who had been heading back to her desk, was called over by her supervisor.

Once inside the office, Emma Carter had just settled into her chair when Stella Ling lowered her gaze and confessed, "Emma, I was just messing with Wang Lingling earlier. I’m not really connected to someone like Li Qizhen; I barely know him."

"I just can’t stand Wang Lingling and wanted to rattle her, give her a scare."

Emma Carter burst into laughter, "I figured as much. Only she would fall for that!"

Emma's laughter put Stella Ling at ease.

Emma Carter had been chuckling, but Stella Ling’s next words left her speechless.

"But I really have come into some money, and I don’t want to be just an employee anymore."

Stella Ling explained, feeling that as long as she remained a worker, she might still encounter colleagues like Wang Lingling. Especially now that she had significant resources at her disposal, she worried that if colleagues saw her being approached by influential figures, it would fuel gossip—worse, someone like Wang Lingling might stir up trouble out of jealousy.

Thus, after resigning, she had no plans to seek another translating job.

Stella Ling didn’t want to be a mere employee anymore; she wanted to be her own boss!

Even if subordinates envied their boss's success, they likely wouldn’t express it openly. If any foolish subordinate dared to act like Wang Lingling, she'd fire them without hesitation!

Being a boss was liberating!

Emma Carter, still processing, asked, "Wait, so you’re not looking for another job in translation?"

"Exactly," Stella Ling nodded.

Emma Carter couldn’t help but advise, "Stella, living off past earnings isn't wise. Even with money, staying engaged with the world is important. What if something unexpected happens and the money runs out?"

After hearing Emma's advice, Stella Ling smiled, "Emma, I inherited a substantial fortune from relatives. While I’m stepping back from work, I plan to start my own business!"

"If I open a large company one day and need to hire, you have to come work for me. I promise to pay you more than you earn here!"

Hearing Stella Ling's offer, Emma Carter was taken aback.

Emma Carter currently earned a solid salary. For Stella Ling to promise more? 

Moreover, starting a company wouldn’t involve hiring just one person, right? If she planned to establish a company in a major city, the rent alone would be significant. 

Emma Carter’s own company spent a hefty amount on rent monthly, and it sounded like Stella Ling was planning something larger than "Bai Xue," sparking her curiosity about the scale of Stella’s inheritance.

But curiosity aside, personal finances were private; unless someone chose to share, it was disrespectful to pry.

Emma Carter didn’t press further but instead smiled and said, “Wow, I’ve just secured a valuable connection!”

"Then it’s settled! When you open your company, you’ll have to outbid my current employer to get me on board; I’ll be waiting for your call!" 

Stella Ling beamed back, "You can count on it."

Emma Carter had called Stella Ling to her office not for any specific reason but to prevent Stella from feeling awkward returning to her desk. 

After all, Stella’s earlier remarks to Wang Lingling had clearly been exaggerated. Who would believe that a socialite could convincingly pose as an ordinary worker? It was a stretch.

The staff outside were likely buzzing with rumors about Stella.

However, Emma Carter believed that Stella truly had come into money.

Stella valued her as a friend; not only was she unafraid to discuss finances, but she also spoke openly about her inheritance and even considered hiring her with a competitive salary if she started a big company.

Her mentorship of this junior hadn’t been wasted. 

But she’d also tried to mentor Wang Lingling, and that girl had been nothing but trouble—no peace of mind there!

Stella Ling stayed in Emma Carter’s office for about half an hour. 

When her colleagues saw her emerge without tears, they were curious about what had transpired inside.

A female colleague glanced at Stella Ling’s back and leaned closer to another female colleague, whispering, "Hey, do you think what Stella said is true? Is she really a rich girl?"

The other female colleague rolled her eyes, scoffing, "Do you believe that? Stella said those things to provoke Wang Lingling; only someone like Wang Lingling would buy it."

"Are you calling me gullible?"

"Of course not! … Wait, you really believed it! Stella doesn’t have the aura of a rich girl at all!"

"Keep your voice down! Ahem, what aura does a rich girl have?"

"Naturally, it's an air of elegance! Some rich girls might not be conventionally beautiful, but their skin is always flawless. Stella is pale but looks a bit under the weather—her skin isn’t that smooth either. And her hair, though voluminous, seems thin and lackluster, not exactly what you’d expect from someone well-off. Real heiresses have thick, shiny hair! If someone has good skin and hair, they just exude an air of elegance. Moreover, the truly wealthy have a certain carefree innocence."

"Stella is pretty innocent too. Wang Lingling bullies her all the time, and she never fights back. She’s always polite. If it weren’t for Wang Lingling pushing her this time, I doubt Stella would have said those things."

"Oh, I’m not talking about her personality! The innocence I’m referring to is that carefree vibe that comes from a life of comfort, like they’ve never had to worry about anything. You get it?"

"I get it now. I think Emily Williams has that kind of vibe you’re talking about. I heard her family is wealthy; her fans say she’s the real deal, a classic rich girl."

"Please! That’s just her public persona! Did you see how she scrambles for brand endorsements? Does a real heiress behave like that over endorsements? It’s all for show! Besides, don’t you feel there’s a cunning look in her eyes sometimes?"

"I don’t see it that way. Isn’t Emily Williams genuinely wealthy?"

"Definitely not! Let me tell you…"

Their conversation drifted off-topic, and Stella Ling, sitting not far away, sighed in relief.

Sometimes, she really despised her sharp hearing.

After all, her story had too many holes, and essentially no one believed her.

But it was meant just for Wang Lingling to hear; whether others believed it or not didn’t matter.

After work, Stella Ling took a cab to a nearby beauty salon.

Don’t get it wrong; she wasn’t feeling self-conscious from her colleagues’ comments, wanting to undergo beauty treatments to transform into a glamorous persona.

Instead, she had recently bought two pairs of earrings and hadn’t had the chance to wear them, so she was going to get her ears pierced.

Twenty minutes later, Stella Ling stepped out of the cab and looked up at the luxurious beauty salon before her.

She had asked the driver to take her to any beauty salon, not expecting him to bring her to such an upscale place.

Before leaving, the driver smiled at Stella Ling, saying, "Ma'am, I’ve driven celebrities here before, so I thought this place would suit your needs. Celebrities come here!"

"Uh, that sounds nice. Thank you."

Stella Ling thanked the driver and then walked into the beauty salon known for its celebrity clientele.

Once inside, a friendly staff member approached with a smile, asking how she could assist.

"Do you do ear piercings here?" Stella Ling inquired.

"Yes, we do! Would you like any additional services?" the staff member continued.

"Just the ear piercing, please," Stella Ling replied.

"Of course, right this way."

Stella Ling followed the staff member into a clean, comfortable room, where a masked technician awaited her.

After settling into the chair, Stella Ling began selecting earrings for her new piercings.

They offered two materials: platinum and sterling silver.

Noticing the earrings were small yet elegantly designed, Stella Ling saw the platinum ones were priced around a few hundred dollars, while the silver ones were more affordable.

Ultimately, Stella Ling decided to use her own star-shaped diamond platinum earrings, leaving the salon without purchasing theirs.
