**Spatial Ring**

Stella Lewis had just gotten one ear pierced, costing her about fifteen dollars. Along with it, they gifted her a bag of cotton swabs and a small bottle of antiseptic to prevent infection at the piercing site. As she admired her sparkling earlobes in the mirror handed to her by the staff, she felt a rush of satisfaction.

Just as she was about to leave, a voice echoed in her mind, the familiar sound of her system.  
**[Ding! It’s time for your daily task! Spend $1,500 in the next 30 minutes!]**  
**[Ding! Random task triggered: Spend $75,000 within 1 hour!]**

Stella paused and turned to the masked staff member. “Do you have a membership card?”

By the time she stepped out of the beauty salon, three hours had passed. Stella had completely transformed her appearance. She had undergone full-body hair removal, rejuvenating skin treatments, eyebrow shaping, eyelash extensions, hair treatments, and styling. Every non-invasive beauty treatment available was checked off her list.

Not only that, but Stella also purchased a mountain of skincare and haircare products from the salon. By the end of her spree, she had already spent about $10,000 from her membership card worth $77,000. Stella wasn’t entirely sure if all these beauty treatments were worth the expense, but when she caught a glimpse of her fresh and charming self in the salon’s floor-length mirror, her spirits soared.

In the Clear Lotus Beauty Salon, the masked staff member who had pierced Stella's ears commented to another colleague who had initially greeted her, “Customers are getting harder to read these days. If we had shown even the slightest rudeness, that Miss Lewis would definitely not have signed up for our membership!”

“Absolutely! You have no idea, when I heard her say she was just getting her ears pierced, I almost rolled my eyes. Thankfully, I remembered our training: always be polite to customers. Had we acted disrespectfully, our commissions would have flown out the window!”

“I almost lost it when she said she’d use her own earrings. I mean, look at her outfit today—it’s so ordinary. It must’ve been a test because our boss always says that we can’t judge by appearances in this line of work.”

The two staff members shared their experiences, still a bit shaken from the encounter with Stella.

Meanwhile, in her dorm room, Amy Turner was snacking and watching a drama when she heard the sound of keys turning in the lock. Turning around, she saw a striking girl walk in.  
“Stella!” 

Recognizing her immediately, Amy sprang up from her chair in surprise.  
“It’s really you! You look amazing!” 

Stella found Amy’s reaction a bit exaggerated. After all, she had only changed her hairstyle and eyebrow shape, and her skin was just a tad brighter. Overall, she hadn’t changed too much, but still, the compliment made her smile brightly.  

“Wow, your eyelashes are so long, and you even got your ears pierced! Those earrings look so pretty and really suit you! Looks like I’ll have to step aside from the ‘dorm beauty’ title!”  

Amy continued to shower her with praise.

Stella’s transformation was so dramatic; not only were boys vying for her attention, but she also appeared more confident and stunning.  
“Ha ha, you’re being so dramatic!”  

Stella laughed, enjoying her time with Amy, which was always a pleasure.  
“Thanks for the compliments! I bought a bunch of snacks; let me share some with you.”  

As she spoke, Stella began to open a suitcase she had pulled into the dorm.

Amy’s attention shifted to the two large suitcases, one black and one pink. “Are you moving in today?”  

“Yeah.” Stella nodded.

“I’ll help you with that!”

Amy reached to assist but suddenly remembered she had just eaten spicy snacks, her hands covered in oil. “Wait a sec! I’ll wash my hands and use the restroom first!”

As her roommate rushed into the bathroom, Stella quickly unlocked her storage cabinet. She extended her right hand, adorned with a ring, and waved it over her now half-empty cabinet. In an instant, the items within vanished by more than half.

This was the physical reward she had received after completing her random task today—a spatial ring capable of storing items, with an internal space of 10 cubic meters. When Stella realized that the prize was not an ordinary ruby ring but a spatial ring, she was utterly stunned.

What an essential item for home and travel! She wouldn’t even need to hire a moving company for her future relocations. However, Stella understood that she had to be discreet when using this spatial ring; she was smart enough to avoid attracting attention.

After acquiring the spatial ring, Stella had also bought two large suitcases from a nearby store, since she was indeed moving in and didn’t want to raise her roommate’s suspicions. Before arriving at the dorm, she had also secretly stored all the snacks she received from the school’s delivery station into the spatial ring, only leaving out a portion to share with Amy.

Once Amy emerged from the bathroom, she was greeted with the sight of Stella pulling snacks out of her suitcase.  
“So these are the snacks you bought? So many!”  

Amy exclaimed, then noticed that Stella was about to dump all the snacks onto her messy desk.  
“You’re giving me all this? Aren’t you keeping any for yourself?” Amy asked, startled.

“I have plenty left at my place. These are just for you.” Stella replied with a smile as she continued to unpack.

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Amy eagerly helped Stella carry her belongings. With Amy’s help, Stella donated old clothes and shoes to the recycling bin set up next to the dormitory. She packed up old underwear and tossed it out without a second thought.

Items like a washbasin, laundry detergent, and soap were given to younger students who needed them. The detergent and soap could still be used, and the old basin was perfect for cleaning shoes.

Stella entrusted Amy with the blankets and sheets from her bed. During graduation season, there would be people collecting old bedding in the dorms, and they would just sell it off then.

Looking at the now completely cleared space, Amy remarked, “Stella, you really didn’t need two suitcases. One would have sufficed!”

...

The next day at work, everyone in the marketing department was astonished by Stella’s transformation. Dressed in high-end clothing from a brand called Sarah's Boutique, paired with a soft yellow leather handbag and shiny goat leather sandals, her earlobes twinkled with earrings. Her previously dull hair now flowed smoothly over her shoulders, and her skin looked noticeably better than the day before.

“Stella, you look gorgeous today!”  

Jennifer Bloom, who had exchanged phone numbers with Stella, walked over to compliment her.  
“Thank you.”

Stella smiled sincerely, her newly shaped crescent eyebrows enhancing the beauty of her eyes when she smiled.

“Is that outfit you’re wearing a new release from Sarah's Boutique?” A female colleague approached her, uncertainty in her voice.

“Yes.” Stella nodded, recalling that the salesperson at the Sarah's Boutique store in the international trade mall had mentioned that she was wearing the latest spring-summer collection.

The colleague’s eyes widened as she pulled out her phone to check the price of Stella’s outfit. When she saw the price, her jaw dropped, nearly able to fit an egg inside.  
Stella was wearing over $9,000 worth of Sarah's Boutique!

Wait, is that handbag also from Sarah's Boutique? I need to check!  
Damn! The bag is also expensive! It costs $6,000!  
Stella had worn $15,000 worth of clothing to work!

So she really is a rich girl!

The female colleague quickly spread the word about Stella’s $15,000 outfit to other coworkers.  
While some were shocked but accepted the truth of Stella being a rich girl, others doubted the authenticity of her outfit.

“How could it be fake? I remember the last time Stella brought a bunch of Nike bags to the office; she must have been pretending to be poor!” Rachel said.

“Rachel, those are two different levels! One is around a hundred, and the other is in the thousands! I believe the Nike stuff is real, but I just can’t accept that her Sarah's Boutique is authentic.”  

A skeptical colleague retorted.

However, by lunchtime, the doubts were swiftly dispelled.  
Stella quietly shelled out her own money to treat everyone in the marketing department to lunch.

She bought gourmet bento boxes, dessert, iced coffee, and snacks, all to express gratitude for their help the day before when they had helped her deal with the outburst from Wendy.

There were 29 people in the marketing department, and Stella spent nearly $3,000 on the lunch. At this point, no one dared to doubt her status as a rich girl.

In reality, Stella’s generous lunch was to thank the senior colleague and the two male colleagues who helped her with Wendy. But since she got along well with everyone else in the marketing department, she decided to treat them all.

This lavish lunch cost Stella $2,953, of which $1,500 was from today’s daily task money, with the rest topped up from her bank account.

As everyone enjoyed the free luxury bento filled with Wagyu beef and seafood, looking forward to dessert and snacks afterward, their faces lit up with happiness, showering Stella with thanks and compliments.

At first, Stella felt a bit shy about the attention, but soon she accepted it wholeheartedly. If she hadn’t been linked with the system, she would have been just as grateful if a colleague had treated her to such a meal.

Jennifer approached Stella with her bento box, nervously asking, “Can I sit with you?”

“Of course!” Stella smiled.

Jennifer happily took a seat at Wendy’s desk.

The sudden transformation of her new friend into a rich girl left Jennifer a bit stunned, but she felt reassured when she noticed Stella was still her kind, attentive self.

Even though Stella's status had changed, she remained the kind girl who listened to others’ thoughts with genuine interest.

Meanwhile, Kelly, sitting in the office with a bento box that looked significantly more luxurious than her subordinates’, mused to herself as she took a bite, “This Wagyu is amazing! The abalone is delicious! The king crab legs are so fresh! Her relatives must be really wealthy to leave her such a fortune!”
