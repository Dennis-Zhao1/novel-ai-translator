**The Best Children's Day Gift**

Stella Lane noticed the comment but knew there wasn't much she could do about it. She had received a tenfold cash-back card for streaming tips, and the best way to use it was through donations. Her bank account initially had $7,500.

She charged $7,000 into TikTok and tipped "Mrs. Smith" 15 times during the Carnival event. Instantly, her bank account was credited with $70,000, a genuine tenfold return in cash. Stella was thrilled; she immediately deposited the newly credited $70,000 back into TikTok, holding down the Carnival tip button for continuous donations.

"Another 150 Carnivals!"

"Mrs. Smith has really found some kind-hearted people!"

"Mike" expressed his jealousy, saying, "What kind-hearted people! Just a bunch of fools!"

A middle-aged man with a receding hairline, making him look more intense, stared wide-eyed at his phone screen, his envy so overwhelming that he nearly drooled! This middle-aged man was "Mike," an insurance salesman.

He was the type to go to any length to sell insurance. Recently, he had discovered a novel way to promote his insurance products—by sneaking into various short video platforms' live streams, especially those of hosts like "Mrs. Smith," who were in dire straits.

Using this tactic, Mike had actually sold a few high-value insurance policies, which only fueled his confidence in selling insurance in the live streams of people facing hardships. He believed that anyone afraid of death would fear the prospect of falling ill and being unable to afford treatment, ending up in a situation like "Mrs. Smith."

However, he never expected that "Mrs. Smith" would actually receive help! The dazzling effects of the Carnivals exploded before his eyes.

How much money was this?

How many insurance policies could he buy with that?

Just as the audience in the live stream thought the Carnival explosions were over, ten seconds later, a new wave of Carnivals erupted!

It was then that Linda truly realized she wasn’t dreaming; someone was indeed tipping her—at the highest amount!

Linda couldn’t calculate how much the tips totaled, but she knew she would ultimately have to split it with the platform. Feeling grateful that her benefactor had spent so much, she looked into the camera with tears in her eyes and said, "Thank you, the brightest star in the night sky! Thank you for your help! If you want to help Andy and Nancy, you can donate directly through the love donation channel."

Stella couldn’t help but notice and replied in a tone that seemed to show off, "I saw it, but I prefer donating through tips."

The viewers in the live stream reacted with disbelief at this comment, thinking, "This person is so full of themselves!" But they had to admit that this person had the capital to be that way.

If they had the ability to tip like "the brightest star in the night sky," they might be even more ostentatious!

Moreover, if they really had that much money, although they knew "Mrs. Smith" was pitiful, they might not be willing to donate so much. Some believed that giving tips to youthful, attractive female hosts or up-and-coming male hosts would yield greater emotional returns. After all, "Mrs. Smith" could only respond with a simple thank you after receiving the tips, whereas those young streamers might offer so much more in return.

“Mrs. Smith’s” live stream, thanks to Stella’s nonstop tipping, surged to the top of the TikTok platform, attracting many newcomers eager to see what kind of live stream was so popular.

“Let’s see which big shot is so inhumane!”

“This is the first time I’ve witnessed someone tipping so many Carnivals, over 600! The brightest star in the night sky666!”

“Unfortunately, I lack culture; just saying 'awesome' would suffice!”

“Uh, I thought it was some stunning female streamer making the big shots toss money, but it turns out to be a middle-aged woman! Not even pretty!”

“Hey, mind your words! This isn't the kind of live stream you’re thinking of; it’s for someone in need asking the public for help.”

New viewers who were unaware of “Mrs. Smith’s” situation learned from the comments of regular viewers what this live stream was about.

“I’m so ashamed; I thought it was a cliché story of a wealthy person throwing money at a pretty girl for a smile, but it’s actually a heartwarming story of a kind person donating to a struggling aunt!”

“Definitely uplifting! But I see there’s a direct donation channel in this live stream, so why tip?”

“The big shot says they prefer donating through tips.”

“Wow! Amazing! Since the big shot is a kind person, I won't call them a fool for spending so much; this is a true display of ‘money means nothing!’”

“Exactly! Big shot, sprinkle some of that generosity my way; I haven’t found a job in five months! I’m about to starve at home!”

“Well, then starve! You’re not disabled; you have arms and legs, how could you not find work?”

“Can we ensure this isn’t just a publicity stunt for the streamer? This is a true big shot! To show my respect, I’ll donate $50 to this aunt! But not through tips; I’ll go directly to the donation channel, as $50 isn’t much, and I don’t want her to lose out!”

“Count me in; I’ll donate $10!”

“Me too! I’ll donate $100! It’s been a while since I’ve seen such a positive live stream! Every time I see those male and female streamers raking in the dough, using big shots’ donations to support their lifestyles, it irks me!”

“I’ll donate $10! But how do you know those streamers haven’t given back to the big shots? (laughs)”

“I’ll donate too! I’m donating $20! This is my pocket money for the week; I hope the kids recover quickly!”

“I’ll donate $200!”

As the new viewers in the live stream witnessed the donations pouring in, Linda, overwhelmed with gratitude, wept tears of joy and bowed to the camera, saying, "Thank you! Thank you, everyone! On behalf of Andy and Nancy, thank you! You are all good people!"

The atmosphere in the live stream was joyful, but Mike couldn’t stand it anymore.

Stella’s tipping had already reached nearly $300,000!

Now, others were donating too! “Mrs. Smith” clearly didn’t need more money; why were they joining in?

So, he jumped in to comment, “No need to donate! The 'poor people' you see are wealthier than you think! If you have spare cash to donate, why not save it to buy a good insurance policy? You wouldn’t want to end up like 'Mrs. Smith' one day. When you’re in need, don’t expect someone like 'the brightest star in the night sky' to donate to you!”

“What the heck! Who’s this clown trying to get attention now? Get lost!”

“Are you cursing me? I’ll die before you do! You loser, buy yourself some insurance and remember to make me the beneficiary! Because I’m your daddy!”

“This guy is an insurance salesman who often invades live streams like 'Mrs. Smith's, mocking them while pushing his insurance! What a lowlife!”

“I thought this guy was just rude; turns out he’s the kind of guy relatives avoid seeing!”

“No wonder! They rely on cursing others to sell insurance, as if not buying their insurance means you’ll get sick and die!”

“What bad luck! I got a call from an insurance salesman this morning, and now I find another in the live stream!”

“Don’t judge all insurance salespeople by this 'Mike.' Not everyone pushes insurance in such a morally corrupt way! I sell insurance too, but I wouldn’t enter a struggling person’s live stream to sell my policies; that’s just wrong!”

“Exactly! Insurance itself isn’t the problem; it’s the people selling it! How many working people don’t pay their five insurances and a fund? This 'Mike' is a disgrace! Which insurance company does he represent? I’ll blacklist them for a hundred years! What a pest!”

Mike wasn’t done; he continued to argue, “I’m just being honest! I speak directly! But can you deny that what I’m saying isn’t true?”

“Oh please! Don’t tarnish the term ‘straight man’ with your nonsense!”

“I’ll donate $100! You’re not a straight man; you’re an old fool!”

Stella also noticed the situation in the comments and, seeing that she had 20 minutes left to use her tenfold cash-back card, realized she still had 27 Carnivals left to tip. Feeling confident, she replied to Mike, saying, “You mentioned that treating two children with a rare illness would cost at least $120,000. I just looked it up; the total treatment cost for a patient is around $45,000 to $75,000 or more. I plan to add $30,000 on top of the $120,000, which is just to cover the basic treatment costs for 'Mrs. Smith’s' children. There’s no way it’s as exaggerated as you claim that she’s wealthier than us!”

After reading Stella’s comment, most viewers in the live stream expressed their agreement and rallied to support “Mrs. Smith.”

“The brightest star in the night sky is right! I’ll donate $200! Mrs. Smith should buy some good food for Andy and Nancy!”

“I’ll donate $50! The basic treatment costs may be covered, but expenses could rise!”

“I’ll donate $5,000!”

“Big brother upstairs is incredibly generous!”

“I’m not a big brother!”

“Well then… big sister, you’re generous!”

“I’ll donate $30!”

“I’ll donate $300! The streamer can use it to buy snacks for Andy and Nancy!”

Mike attempted to stir things up again with another comment, but it was quickly drowned out by a barrage of donation comments.

After this happened a few times, Mike had to give up, seething in his home as he stared at his phone in impotent rage!

At this point, Stella had tipped a total of 667 Carnivals, amounting to $300,000. Ultimately, “Mrs. Smith” would receive $150,000.

Afterward, Stella left “Mrs. Smith's” live stream without saying a word and began searching for the next person in need of her help.

With 17 minutes left on her tenfold cash-back card, Stella searched for the word “illness” in the TikTok live stream plaza.

Skipping over the first live stream of “Mrs. Smith,” she clicked into the second-ranking stream, “Immunodeficiency Jamie.”

Upon entering, Stella didn’t ask the elderly host, who was currently streaming, how much treatment for his granddaughter’s illness would cost, as she had done in “Mrs. Smith’s” live stream.

She feared that if she asked, time would run out before she could tip enough, leaving the host disappointed. So, she opted not to inquire.

Instead, she clicked on the host's profile, where it detailed the child’s illness and required treatments.

The child had a rare disease—severe combined immunodeficiency. At eight months old, the child had suffered a serious infection but had survived through sheer will. A bone marrow transplant was the last hope.

Stella quickly searched online for the cost of a bone marrow transplant, discovering that if a match was found among relatives, the transplant would cost around $30,000. For patients matched with the bone marrow bank, it could range from $37,500 to $45,000, while a half-match transplant among relatives would run about $45,000 to $60,000. Additionally, post-transplant care would require chemotherapy, anti-infection measures, and anti-rejection treatment—specific costs were hard to estimate.

So, she decided to set the highest estimate at $60,000 and add another $30,000 for follow-up treatment.

Next, Stella checked the information on severe combined immunodeficiency.

She found that children with this condition require sterile laminar flow rooms, abbreviated as “entering the chamber.” The cost of keeping a child in the chamber would be at least over $90,000.

Seeing that the host’s granddaughter had successfully entered the chamber, Stella guessed from the elderly man’s simple attire that they might struggle to afford the high costs, likely accumulating significant debt.

So, she added another $105,000 to her estimate.

Altogether, the treatment cost was approximately $195,000, meaning she would need to tip a total of $390,000—$9,000 more than “Mrs. Smith”!

With only ten minutes left on her tenfold cash-back card, Stella had no time to waste. She quickly recharged $390,001 into TikTok and began tipping vigorously.

She didn’t have the time to keep an eye on the live stream's comments, praying she could complete the 867 tips in ten minutes.

If she couldn’t finish before time expired…

If she couldn’t, then she couldn’t.

After all, her bank account now had nearly $3 million in savings. Even if she donated $390,000 directly, she wouldn’t be broke.

Help people to the end, right?

Besides, she had already deposited so much into TikTok. If she didn’t use it all, she would only be able to withdraw half back to her bank account. Why bother? It was better to donate it all!

Perhaps good deeds yield good rewards; Stella managed to finish the tipping just 20 seconds before the cash-back card expired.

As a result, Stella's bank account balance soared past $6 million, making her a veritable millionaire!

“Bank of America alerts: Your account ending in 3939 received a deposit of $3,900,000.00 on June 1 at 19:25. Current balance: $6,146,508.00.”

Stella gleefully spun around her dorm room with her phone in hand. Why rent a place anymore?

She would just buy a house!

Thinking about finally owning her own home in the capital city filled her with a sense of joy and disbelief.

Could this really be happening?

Stella glanced at the system cat, which was engrossed in a drama on her fruit laptop, and cautiously asked, “System, you’re not fake, right?”

The cat, caught up in an intense scene where the female lead was about to slap the antagonist with some pickled vegetables, replied without turning around, “Just touch me and you’ll know if I’m real or not! Although I’m cute like a doll, I’m definitely real~”

In the next second, the system was engulfed in Stella's embrace as she rubbed it from head to toe, causing the system to meow in surprise.

“Whoa, you’re interrupting the best part!”

The system’s round face was so squished that it couldn’t form coherent sentences, and it angrily vanished from Stella's hands, retreating into her mind to protest.

Hearing the system complain in her head, Stella finally calmed down from her excitement and apologized, “I’m sorry, I’ll rewind the progress bar to the exciting part for you; can you watch it again?”

【Hmph! o(´^｀)o】

“System, let’s order some snacks online tonight! Let’s buy all the snacks we want!”

Stella cheerfully suggested, hoping to win back the system’s favor with snacks.

“Sounds great!ヽ(≧∀≦)ﾉ”

The system happily transformed into its original form and began to dance around Stella excitedly.

Seeing the cat no longer upset, Stella opened the Amazon page on her laptop, allowing the system to choose snacks and instructed, “Don’t buy too much at first; our dorm is too small to store them. Once we move into a bigger house, you can buy as much as you want!”

“Okay~”

The cat, holding the mouse, nodded obediently and threw itself into the task of choosing snacks.

Picking snacks could be done whenever; the melodramatic drama could wait!

Stella reopened the TikTok app.

After spending $690,000 on TikTok, her account level upgraded to level 54, and she discovered her message inbox was flooded with friend requests.

Stella clicked on the messages, finding many from people admiring her charitable actions who wanted to befriend her.

Some even shared their own struggles, similar to “Mrs. Smith” and “Immunodeficiency Jamie,” asking for her help.

The most outrageous was someone who sent her an invitation to offer their “body” to her!

Stella was left speechless, realizing that the internet had all kinds of people! She’d learned something new!

Not responding to those messages, she continued scrolling until she found a private message from “Mrs. Smith.”

Opening it, she saw it was a message of thanks.

“Brightest star in the night sky, thank you so much for helping our family! Could you please leave me a contact number? I’d like to thank you in person with Andy and Nancy!”

Stella smiled at the message and replied, “No need; just consider it my Children’s Day gift to Andy and Nancy.”

After closing that message, she reached the message from “Immunodeficiency Jamie.”

“I’m Jamie’s father. I just learned about your kindness from my father. Could you please leave your contact number? I’d like to thank you in person!”

Stella smiled again, repeating the words she had used in her reply to “Mrs. Smith.”

What Stella didn’t know was that “Mrs. Smith” and “Immunodeficiency Jamie” had not ended their live streams yet, and the viewers staying in those two streams were eagerly awaiting her response.

“She replied!”

Linda exclaimed, looking at the screen filled with excitement.

Linda was live-streaming on her phone; to avoid exiting the live stream, she chose to live stream in a small window and opened the message page.

After reading Stella’s reply, Linda immediately burst into tears.

This was already the umpteenth time she had cried during today’s stream.

Ever since her twins were diagnosed with a rare illness, she had been crying almost every day, feeling as bitter as if she were soaked in bitter herb water.

But today, the bitter water was infused with clear spring water, easing her heartache. The tears she shed now were out of joy.

“What did the benefactor say?”

Seeing Linda covering her mouth and crying without speaking, anxious viewers couldn’t help but comment, asking her to reply.

“What did they say?”

“Curiosity is killing me; hurry up and respond!”

Mike suddenly jumped in with a comment, “Maybe the fool has regrets and wants the streamer to return the money!”

“I can’t believe this clown is still trying to get attention! How thick-skinned! Everyone, let’s report this old fool together and get this insurance salesman kicked out of TikTok!”

“I reported him!”

“Me too!”

“I reported him ages ago, but why is TikTok so slow to handle the reports?”

“Mrs. Smith, what did the brightest star in the night sky say?”

At this moment, Linda seemed to regain her composure from the excitement.

Noticing the comments in the live stream, she quickly replied honestly, “The benefactor said we don’t need to contact her, and that this was a Children’s Day gift for Andy and Nancy!”

Upon hearing this response, the live stream erupted.

“Wow! How heartwarming! I almost forgot today was Children’s Day!”

“This truly is the best Children’s Day gift! Happy Children’s Day, Andy and Nancy!”

“Happy Children’s Day! I wish you both health and safety from all illnesses!”

“Happy Children’s Day!”

“I came from the adjacent live stream of Immunodeficiency Jamie. The brightest star in the night sky gave the same response there; truly a kind-hearted person!”

“What adjacent live stream? Where did the big shot go after leaving?”

“Don’t you know? After tipping 667 Carnivals in this stream, the big shot moved to Immunodeficiency Jamie’s stream, where they tipped 867 Carnivals!”

“Whoa! Let me calculate that!”

“Brother upstairs, you don’t need to calculate; the big shot donated a total of $690,000 today!”

“And don’t forget to add $2,000; don’t just omit amounts below ten thousand!”

“This is the first time I’ve encountered a selfless philanthropist like this in a live stream! It’s truly heartwarming!”
