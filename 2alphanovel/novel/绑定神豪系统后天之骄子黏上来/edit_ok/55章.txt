**Chapter 1: The Laptop That Changed Everything**

"Ivy, I don't know when your birthday is..." 

The soft voice of the Celestial Fortune System echoed in Ivy Lane's mind.

"I never told you, plus I forgot myself! Besides, you send me money every day. It feels like I'm celebrating my birthday every day," Ivy thought, a smile playing on her lips.

"Can we have a cream pie today? I suddenly want some," the system chimed in, almost like a child asking for a treat.

"Alright, alright. After I finish this farewell dinner, I’ll get you one," Ivy replied, chuckling. Then she added, "By the way, besides detecting the nearby guys you've tagged as Heaven's Chosen Ones, make sure to alert me if they pop up around me."

"Ah? You want me to remind you of that too? That guy with the last name Johnson was just nearby!" the system alerted her.

"What!?" Ivy exclaimed, her expression shifting to one of caution as she swiftly scanned her surroundings.

"He’s already left. He took off right after you finished chatting with Ethan," the system clarified.

Hearing this, Ivy relaxed. In her mind, Johnson was undoubtedly the most intense among the known Heaven's Chosen Ones. She couldn't help but wonder how he reacted after she declined that set of jewelry last time. But honestly, she didn't want to know.

What she really hoped was that he had overheard her conversation with Ethan. That way, if he approached her again, she wouldn’t have to repeat that she was incapable of love.

Indeed, Johnson had heard them. Even though he was some distance away from Ivy and Ethan, he could easily eavesdrop on their conversation using advanced technology.

"Unable to love, huh?" Johnson, seated in his wheelchair, lightly bit his thin lips, his sharp eyes swirling with complex emotions.

At that moment, a man dressed in black who was pushing Johnson's wheelchair leaned down and suggested, "Mr. Johnson, should I invite Miss Lane to the Johnson estate?"

Upon hearing this, Johnson's eyes darkened, and a mocking smile appeared. "Do you think my affairs require your meddling?"

"You're only here to assist me, not to manage my life," he added coldly.

The man in black immediately straightened up, lowering his head in apology. "I’m sorry, Mr. Johnson. I overstepped."

Johnson ignored him, maneuvering his wheelchair forward without a care.

"Unable to love, huh?"

Johnson found this amusing. He wished for Ivy Lane to never belong to any man throughout her life. Just to let him quietly observe her from the shadows until his life burned out.

After finishing her graduation farewell dinner, Ivy waved goodbye to her friends, Sarah and Lucy. She stepped out of the restaurant, holding two champagne roses, intending to catch a taxi to the airport. After encountering two Heaven’s Chosen Ones in a single day, she had no desire to remain in New York any longer.

As she contemplated, a vibrant shade of rose red caught her eye.

"Ivy, congratulations on your graduation!" 

Chris presented a bouquet of red roses to her, smiling warmly.

Ivy: "..."

Great, all three of the Heaven's Chosen Ones she knew had shown up today.

She scoffed, countering, "What? You don’t wish me a happy birthday too?"

Chris bit his lip, unsure how to respond.

This reaction confirmed to him that Ivy must have known about his investigation into her.

"Ivy, I think there’s been a misunderstanding between us," he said, his gaze softening as he looked at her.

"Misunderstanding? Are we talking about you stalking me or checking my bank account?" Ivy shot back, meeting his gaze with unwavering intensity, exposing the truths he wanted to conceal.

Ivy never understood why Chris needed to check her bank account. Even if it were to investigate a business competitor, there should be a legitimate reason. Yet this man was abusing his power and money, checking whoever he pleased!

What was he checking for? Afraid that she might out-earn him?

"I'm sorry, I know I was wrong. I just really like you..." 

"Stop right there!" Ivy interrupted, raising her hand to cut off his words. She had no interest in hearing his excuses.

She was certain that if she hadn’t exposed Chris's facade, he would have continued pretending everything was fine, maintaining his noble and elegant image in front of her.

Unlike her patience with Ethan earlier, she couldn’t tolerate the sight of Chris crumbling before her. Perhaps it was because she had felt a slight attraction to him during their first meeting.

"I’m telling you clearly today, I don’t like you and won’t develop feelings for anyone because I am incapable of love!"

"If you don’t know what 'unable to love' means, just check online!" 

With that, Ivy walked away without caring about Chris’s reaction, heading toward a nearby taxi.

Chris desperately wanted to stop her, to prevent her from leaving. But Ivy had clearly displayed her unwillingness to engage, making him hesitate to act. He feared that if he tried to hold onto her, it would only make her angrier.

Watching the person he cared about drive away, he felt a mix of sadness and helplessness as she distanced herself from him.

Had he really messed everything up?

For the first time, the man who thought he could control everything began doubting himself.

"She’s telling the truth!" 

A woman’s voice suddenly broke through Chris's thoughts.

Turning, he saw a stranger in a purple dress.

"She truly is incapable of love; I saw her use that excuse to turn someone down earlier today. She has a psychological condition!" 

Wendy continued, hoping Chris would believe her words.

"You are?" Chris asked, puzzled.

Wendy looked at him incredulously. She wanted to spill all her grievances but held back her frustration, explaining, "I’m Wendy, a former colleague of Ivy Lane. Don’t you remember? We met at the Lincoln Tower."

Chris recalled who she was—the woman who had tried to steal Ivy's credit. He didn’t have a good impression of her and suppressed all his emotions, turning to leave without further conversation.

Feeling ignored, Wendy wanted to cry. She continued to talk about Ivy, hoping to sway Chris. "She hasn’t dated anyone for four years in college and avoids contact with men. She truly is incapable of love; there’s no future with her!"

The phrase "there's no future" struck a nerve with Chris. He turned back, coldly replying, "It’s none of your business!"

Seeing him turn away without a hint of hesitation shattered Wendy’s composure.

She covered her face and squatted down, sobbing uncontrollably.

What was happening?

Not just Chris, but even that handsome guy who brought flowers to the school this morning!

Why did all these quality men like Ivy Lane?! Were they blind?

Wendy suddenly looked up, recalling the harsh words Ivy once said to her at work.

Could it be that Ivy wasn’t lying? Was she truly on the same level as Chris?

No wonder when she returned to the office, she heard colleagues gossiping about Ivy being a rich girl.

She had scoffed at them then, thinking they were foolish to be deceived.

Wendy remembered a comment under a post she found while searching for tips on dating wealthy men.

"Ordinary people shouldn’t dream. To marry into a wealthy family, you need to be stunningly beautiful and emotionally intelligent. Otherwise, you’ll only be a plaything, unable to go past the marriage barrier. The fairy tale of the Cinderella marrying into a wealthy family only happens in cheesy romances. In reality, wealthy men only marry women from similar backgrounds. Don’t forget, even Cinderella was a noble. We women must empower ourselves and not always rely on others. We should create wealth with our own hands and live the lives we desire! It’s much more satisfying to spend money earned by ourselves!"

Wendy, deeply vain, instinctively brushed off the last sentence, but she couldn't help but feel regret. "So Ivy really is a rich girl, and Chris is pursuing her because of their social standing!"

"Damn! If I had known she was that wealthy, I would have treated her better and asked her to introduce me to a boyfriend!" 

Wendy cursed inwardly.

She could give up on Chris, but there were plenty of other wealthy men in the world. If one wouldn’t work out, she could pursue another!

With that thought, she wiped her tears and stood up, heading home.

She needed to return and dive deeper into those posts about dating wealthy men.

She refused to believe that she would never touch the edge of the upper class in her life!

Before boarding, Ivy remembered she hadn’t deleted Chris from her contacts. She immediately took out her phone and blocked him.

"Ha~"

Ivy sighed, contemplating what she would miss the most about leaving New York.

It had to be the apartment she rented for three months near Central Park.

She hadn’t even lived there for a month, and the money was non-refundable.

Just thinking about it made her feel frustrated.

Oh well, at least she still had the monthly task funds left to spend, so she should consider how to use that money first.

For today’s daily task, after buying a flower bouquet for $300, she stored the remaining funds onto a Walmart shopping card.

With a substantial amount in monthly task funds, Ivy had no idea where to allocate it.

She never imagined she would have a day where she struggled with how to spend money.

After disembarking, Ivy immediately deposited the money into her company’s main account.

Feeling a bit exhausted, she didn’t want to ponder over where to spend the funds anymore. This money would serve as operational capital for her company.

Thinking it over, she had already invested a significant amount into starting this entertainment company.

Ivy couldn’t help but worry if an ordinary person like her could successfully manage an entertainment venture.

"Ivy, time to draw a prize! The rewards for the monthly task might be substantial!" 

At the sound, Ivy quickly decided to draw.

Would she finally get a guide on how to manage an entertainment company?

Come on, Celestial Fortune, give me something good!

No, no, no! 

She couldn’t let the potential rewards blind her!

She still wanted the skill to conceal her luck!

The prize drawing wheel was divided into 16 sections, offering the same generous rewards as the initial beginner package.

There were 8 cash rewards, 6 physical rewards, and 2 random skill rewards.

Ivy gazed at the massive villa in the physical rewards section and suddenly reconsidered her target.

No! She had to stay firm!

Give me the skill to conceal my luck!

Ivy shouted in her heart, wanting the Celestial Fortune to feel her seriousness.

Clicking to draw, the pointer spun rapidly before finally slowing to a stop in the physical reward zone.

Instead of the villa, it landed on a laptop.

A laptop connecting parallel universes—entertainment limited edition? 

What a strange name.

Ivy clicked on the reward area, and a message unfolded before her eyes.

**Laptop Connecting Parallel Universes**—This laptop can connect to parallel universes on Earth, allowing the host to view all entertainment pieces from those parallel worlds for up to 8 hours a day.

Ivy was stunned; even parallel universes were involved now!

The entertainment works from those parallel universes must be different from those in her world. So, was the Celestial Fortune suggesting she copy them?

"Ahem! Can you not say it so plainly? It’s about transporting and sharing excellent entertainment works from parallel universes!" 

The system explained.

Ivy: "..."

Once back in her ultra-luxurious hotel suite, she ordered a cream pie for the Celestial Fortune before clicking to claim her physical reward.

She ran her fingers over the sleek Apple logo on the laptop, feeling an uncanny resemblance to her own fruit-branded laptop.

Ivy powered on the laptop and began exploring the entertainment works from the parallel universe.

Since she wanted to form a girl group, she primarily focused on girl group works from the parallel universe.

After watching for three hours, Ivy couldn’t help but marvel at how impressive the girl group works from the parallel universe were.

However, the mainstream market was still dominated by the Korean industry, and her country’s girl groups lacked global impact, only thriving domestically.

In the parallel world’s Korean industry, there were idols like Emily who worked there, with a few even gaining tremendous popularity.

Nevertheless, after returning home, those idols gradually faded from the spotlight, transitioning into film and television, losing the heat they once enjoyed.

The root cause was that the American entertainment scene lacked a stage.

It seemed the entertainment industry in her country had no intention of genuinely investing in stages.

Every time they attempted to do so, it was always half-hearted, resulting in groups that lacked a clear concept—some cool girls dancing to sweet songs, while sweet girls tried to act tough, leading to a jumbled mess.

Even when they finally built a popular girl group, the members would only come together briefly before scattering to film, only to receive criticism for their lackluster acting.

Moreover, the later development of American entertainment was quite distorted, with most people in the industry exuding an air of superiority, churning out mediocre films to deceive the audience. Once criticized by viewers, they would blame the audience for their lack of taste and even start cursing their benefactors.

Calling the public "commoners," who do they think they are?
