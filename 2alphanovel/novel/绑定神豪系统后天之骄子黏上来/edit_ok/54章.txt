**Love Incapacity**

Dana watched as Linda approached them with a deadpan expression. Glancing around, she noticed her two roommates' moods visibly dampen. With a sly grin, Dana suggested, “Why don’t we make a break for it? It’s such a beautiful day, and dealing with Linda, the drama queen, just feels like bad luck, don’t you think?”

Whether Linda was there to deliver her melodramatic lines or to make peace with a smile on graduation day, Stella and her friends wanted no part of it.

Forming a united front, they turned in unison and sprinted toward the auditorium where the graduation ceremony would soon commence, leaving Linda behind, calling their names in exasperation.

“Look at her! She's definitely up to no good! Good thing we got out of there fast!” Dana exclaimed proudly as they ran.

“Aren’t you worried Linda will tell everyone we bullied her in front of the class?” Lucy asked, her tone lighthearted as she jogged alongside.

“Let her report us! We’re graduating anyway! If she doesn’t mind the hassle, she can go straight to the principal!” Dana shrugged, nonchalant.

She recalled their freshman year when dorm disputes led Linda to report them to the counselor, spreading rumors among classmates. That was when Dana first realized how deceptive people could be. She had been so furious she nearly confronted Linda in front of the dean. Thankfully, the counselor intervened just in time; otherwise, Dana, unaccustomed to such unjust treatment, would have ended up in a fierce showdown with the drama queen.

Now, Dana had learned to let go and was no longer as impulsive as she had been in her first year. She realized that engaging someone like Linda only allowed her to play the victim and gain sympathy, turning the tables on legitimate grievances.

Having learned this lesson the hard way, Dana was relieved when the dormitory incident was later cleared up, exposing the rumor as baseless and revealing Linda’s true nature to their classmates. Otherwise, she might have let her temper get the better of her, risking friendships even if she won the argument.

The trio of Stella, Dana, and Lucy continued chatting and laughing until they arrived at the auditorium. Once the graduation ceremony officially began, they set aside their playful banter and eagerly awaited their turn to receive diplomas.

After collecting their certificates and snapping graduation photos, they gathered together, admiring other students being showered with bouquets from family and friends.

Dana and Lucy, both from out of town, couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy seeing local students celebrating with loved ones. Stella, who had grown up in foster care, also felt a longing as she watched the joyful scenes unfold.

Some students received flowers from their significant others, with the popular girls practically buried under heaps of bouquets and gifts.

During their four years at university, only Lucy and Linda had dated, but both relationships ended in heartbreak. After breaking up with her senior in her sophomore year, Lucy became a recluse, preferring to stay in the dorm, binge-watching dramas with Dana during breaks.

Dana, on the other hand, seemed completely uninterested in romance. While she would get excited seeing attractive guys, she never initiated anything nor entertained anyone's advances.

The two girls exuded an air of loneliness, their eyes envious as they watched peers receive flowers. One thought she should have found another boyfriend after her breakup just to avoid being empty-handed at graduation, while the other mused she should have hired a classmate to buy flowers, so she wouldn’t feel so left out.

What a blunder! They were completely unaware of the flower-giving tradition!

**[Today’s challenge: spend $1,500 within 30 minutes!]**
**[Congratulations, Stella! You’re paired with a Lucky Charm for a month!]**
**[Monthly task released: spend $7.5 million within 12 hours!]**

Stella perked up, realizing she had been with her Lucky Charm for a month already! Time flies!

Turning to Dana and Lucy, she instructed, “I need to step away for a bit; I’ll be back soon, so wait for me!”

Without giving them a chance to respond, she dashed off.

When her friends saw her again, she was struggling to carry several bouquets of various colors. Seeing Stella having a hard time, Dana and Lucy rushed over to help, only to hear their roommate buried under the flowers exclaim, “The two green-packaged bouquets over there are for you guys! Hurry and take them; I can barely hold on!”

Overjoyed and touched, Dana and Lucy eagerly accepted the bouquets. The flowers, consisting of champagne roses, lilies, and gardenia leaves, were wrapped in green paper with a cream satin ribbon.

To express her gratitude for their care during their four years together, Stella had specifically chosen the bouquet named “Deep Affection.”

Dana and Lucy were moved and wanted to buy Stella a bouquet in return, but she insisted they each take a flower from their bouquets to give her instead.

After that, Stella asked them to help her deliver the remaining pink carnations to their teachers, which they happily agreed to do.

Aside from her roommates, Stella was most grateful to the instructors from the Language Department who had supported her during these four years.

Not far away, Linda glared at Stella, her expression filled with resentment as she watched her show off.

Hmph, buying flowers for teachers to flaunt your abilities, huh? What’s there to be proud of?

After delivering the bouquets and receiving heartfelt thanks from her roommates and teachers, Stella felt elated. She had thought the day would be filled with joy, until one person’s appearance changed everything.

“Stella! Happy birthday! Congratulations on your graduation!” Ethan suddenly appeared, presenting her with a large bouquet of pink champagne roses.

As Stella stared at the bouquet, unwelcome memories flooded back. The last time she was at the dormitory, Ethan had also brought her roses of a similar color.

To avoid drawing attention again, as she had last time when surrounded by onlookers, Stella quickly signaled for Ethan to follow her to a quieter place.

Ethan cheerfully nodded and followed her to a nearby area on campus that was less crowded – the school playground.

Ethan extended the bouquet towards Stella again, and when she didn’t take it, he grinned broadly, revealing a dazzling smile, and presented her with a beautifully wrapped gift box. “Stella, this is a graduation gift for you.”

“...My birthday isn’t today,” Stella replied wearily.

“That can’t be right! Last time at the police...”

Ethan abruptly stopped, fearing mentioning the word “police” would remind Stella of unpleasant memories.

But he had no idea that the mere sight of his face triggered all those terrible experiences in the karaoke bar for Stella.

“You saw my ID information,” Stella stated flatly, then explained, “I only celebrate my lunar birthday, which has already passed this year, and the date on my ID is the solar birthday.”

In truth, ever since her grandmother passed away, Stella hadn’t celebrated her birthday. She found that celebrating alone only brought back painful memories of her loved ones, reminding her of her loneliness.

Stella disliked celebrating her birthday or any holiday that called for family togetherness; she could never justify spending money on such occasions.

The arrival of her Lucky Charm had eased her feelings of isolation and financial struggles, making her less averse to celebrating holidays.

However, she hadn’t thought of properly celebrating the Fourth of July, partly due to work commitments and partly because she simply didn’t want to.

If it hadn’t been for her Lucky Charm expressing a desire to celebrate, Stella would have treated it like any other day.

As for checking the calendar to remember her lunar birthday, after nearly ten years of neglecting birthdays, Stella had long forgotten about them.

“Well then, this is a gift to celebrate your graduation!” Ethan quickly amended.

“Thanks, but I don’t want it,” Stella replied coolly, firmly rejecting him.

Ethan looked crestfallen, gazing into Stella’s eyes, he managed a bitter smile. “Why not? Can’t you at least consider me a friend and accept this gift?”

“We’re not friends, and I don’t want to be friends with you,” Stella stated bluntly.

“Why can’t we be friends? Is it because I confessed to you awkwardly last time and upset you?” 

“That incident was indeed my fault. I’m sorry!” 

“I’m trying to work on my flaws. If I’ve done something wrong, can you please tell me? I want to improve.”

Ethan gazed at Stella with gentle eyes, his tone sincere.

Feeling the sincerity in his gaze made Stella’s heart feel a bit heavy, and she struggled to find words to say something harsh.

After all, in his pursuit of her, Ethan hadn’t done anything wrong; it was merely a case of bad luck.

Yet knowing the cause of Ethan’s feelings, Stella was acutely aware that she must not give him any false hope.

Not only did she not like him, but even if she did, Stella wouldn’t allow herself to forfeit her dignity and dive into the false emotions that came with bad luck.

After considering her words carefully, she looked at Ethan and slowly said, “You like me, don’t you?”

As a seasoned player in the realm of romance, Ethan had seen it all—flirtation, affection, and declarations of love. 

He had never uttered sweet words to his partners; instead, it was often the women who would say sweet nothings in an attempt to win him over.

He had encountered all sorts of passionate, bold, and subtly affectionate declarations, but hearing this straightforward statement from Stella caused him to blush uncontrollably, a feeling he had never experienced before.

Ethan attempted to deny it, but Stella interrupted, “Don’t give me that line about a friendship confession. Have you ever seen anyone make friends like that?”

Ethan was at a loss for words, his flimsy excuse exposed, leaving him wishing he could hide his face behind the bouquet.

Stella continued, “Thank you for your feelings, but I really can’t accept you.”

“I’m someone who’s love-incapable, not because I’ve been hurt in love, but because I have a natural aversion to it. This isn’t an excuse to reject you; it’s the truth. I’m so averse to love that I don’t plan on getting married in this lifetime.”

“So I’m sorry, please don’t disrupt my life anymore. If you keep pursuing me, it’ll make me feel like a clown, and I really can’t endure my aversion any longer.”

Stella spoke apologetically.

Ethan’s face turned pale, and the bouquet he was holding fell to the ground, scattering a few pink petals around his feet.

Does she really despise him this much?

What is this love incapacity?

Could it be an excuse?

Could it be?

Ethan couldn’t believe there was such a thing as love incapacity in the world.

If that were true, why did the woman he liked have to be love-incapable?

Not just Ethan, but even Dana and Lucy, who had followed them to the playground and eavesdropped on the conversation, were utterly shocked, their minds racing with the revelation.

So Stella is love-incapable?

They had thought Stella hadn’t dated during university simply because she was busy with her studies and work.

But the fundamental reason turned out to be a psychological issue.

Stella isn’t averse to men; she simply hates love.

How convoluted.

Feeling a little guilty, Stella realized that her claim of being love-incapable was merely a ploy to deflect Ethan.

However, she truly had no intention of dating or marrying anyone in this lifetime.

Part of it was to keep her Lucky Charm a secret.

The closest relationship in the world is marriage; who could guarantee that they could keep all their secrets in front of the person they would be spending their life with?

Besides, her Lucky Charm couldn’t possibly pretend to be an ordinary cat in front of a future partner forever, could it?

Even if her Lucky Charm could endure that, Stella wouldn’t allow it to suffer.

The other reason was because of the Chosen Ones.

Stella suspected that even if she did get married, some extreme personalities among the Chosen Ones would never let her go.

If that were the case, the constant harassment would surely disrupt her marriage, so it was better not to marry at all.

Seeing Ethan staring blankly at her, speechless, Stella awkwardly chuckled and said, “I have to go now, I have things to do. Goodbye.”

Hoping not to see him again.

Stella wished this in her heart as she turned to walk out of the playground.

“Stella, this sounds like a psychological issue; can’t a psychologist help you?” Ethan called out after her, holding onto a glimmer of hope.

Stella paused and glanced back at Ethan, concocting a lie, “This is a congenital psychological issue; it can’t be treated, like anti-social personality disorder—there's no cure.”

Ethan was stunned into silence, feeling a wave of sadness wash over him, suddenly overwhelmed with the urge to cry.

If Stella was lying, then she truly must detest him to fabricate such a story!

But if this were true…

Once again, Ethan could only silently question the heavens—why did the woman he liked have to be love-incapable?

Deeply affected, Ethan could only watch helplessly as the person he admired walked further and further away.
