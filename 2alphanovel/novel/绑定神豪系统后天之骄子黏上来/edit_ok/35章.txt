**Morning Jog in the Park**

After clocking out of work, Stella Smith grabbed a ride-share to the nearest large supermarket near her rented apartment. Even though her place was furnished with the essentials, she still needed to stock up on a few daily necessities.

Stella made several trips back and forth between the supermarket and her apartment, finally finishing her shopping spree for the commonly used items. However, she soon realized that her balance on the ride-hailing app had dwindled significantly. What started as a hefty amount was now nearly empty.

While Stella wasn't short on cash, the hassle of constantly using ride-shares began to bother her. As someone who dreamed of owning her own business, how could she not have a car? But buying a car meant she'd need to learn to drive, and with her job still uncertain, it was better to wait until after her resignation on the 15th of this month to consider getting behind the wheel.

With the shopping finally done, Stella set about organizing her new purchases in her apartment. Living alone in a spacious 1500-square-foot place made the task quite tiring. She worked diligently until past ten at night, and by the time she finished tidying up and washing up, it was already eleven.

Under the bright light of her room, Stella began applying hair care products, followed by a series of skincare treatments on her face and body. These were items she'd picked up the day before at the Meadow Beauty Salon, and today marked the first time she would use them. The experience felt quite tedious. Usually, after washing up, a simple application of a moisturizer would suffice before heading to bed. Now, with a handful of new steps to follow before sleep, it felt overly complicated.

It seemed that aspiring to be a refined woman came with its fair share of effort.

The next morning, Stella woke up and touched her face and hair, pleased to find them still as smooth as they had been right after her salon visit two days ago. A smile spread across her face as she thought of the positive effects.

She nudged the lazy cat system sleeping beside her and urged, “Come on, wake up! Didn’t we agree to go for a morning jog today?”

“Ugh… You go ahead and get dressed. Call me when you’re ready to leave,” the little cat mumbled, snuggling deeper into the soft mattress.

With a sigh, Stella decided to wash up and get dressed first. By the time she was ready, the system lazily crawled out from the bed that seemed to have some kind of gravitational pull.

“Maybe you should just stay at home. I can go to the park by myself,” Stella suggested, seeing how sluggish the system was.

“No way! The system cannot leave the host!” it protested, raising its little paw in refusal.

With that determination, Stella had no choice but to pack the system and her pink sports water bottle into her lavender backpack. After heading downstairs, she walked for about ten minutes until she arrived at Maplewood Park, nestled near the Sunshine Gardens neighborhood.

The park was bustling with people, most of whom were middle-aged or older. They were energetically sweating it out on the public exercise equipment, displaying even more vigor than the youngsters around them. Stella stretched her legs, ensuring that the muscle soreness from her previous calf cramp had completely faded. Feeling invigorated, she began jogging along the park’s stone-paved paths.

The park was aptly named "Maplewood" because it was lined with fragrant maple trees on either side of the pathways. However, it was June, and the vibrant fall season for these trees was still a few months away. As she jogged, Stella admired the lush greenery surrounding her, feeling as if the vibrant life around her was infusing her with renewed energy. If she could remain here until October, perhaps she would witness the leaves change, filling the air with their crisp scent.

Unfortunately, Stella knew she couldn't stay in the city for that long. Even if she wanted to start a business and be a boss, she wouldn't set up shop in a city filled with so many "go-getters." She feared that if she tried to venture into entrepreneurship here, she might find herself overwhelmed by these talented individuals.

While her thoughts may seem a bit self-centered, after witnessing the sly approaches of others and the bold confession from a colleague, Stella no longer felt overly optimistic about her chances. If she encountered someone with a volatile personality among the "go-getters," she might have to bid farewell to her currently peaceful life.

“Stella, let me out of the backpack; I’m getting dizzy from being jostled around...” came a voice from within her bag.

Hearing this, Stella halted her jog and quickly unzipped her backpack to free the little cat system. With a look of exasperation, she admonished, “If you’re feeling sick, why not switch back to your non-physical state? It’s got to be uncomfortable being tossed around like that!”

Stella had always thought that as a higher-dimensional life form, the system wouldn't experience discomfort like humans do. After all, its stomach seemed like a bottomless pit, seemingly never satisfied no matter how much it consumed. Naturally, she didn't view it as an ordinary cat.

But who would have thought that after a few bumpy moments, the little system would be feeling under the weather?

“I don’t want to! Being in a physical state is more comfortable!” it whimpered, sounding more cat-like than ever while actually communicating with Stella telepathically.

“Why are you being so stubborn?” Stella gently ruffled the system's fluffy head with concern. “Should I take you to see a vet? Would that help?”

“No way! I’m not a real cat!” it protested angrily, then added, “Stella, just put me down. You don’t need to worry; I’ll play by myself.”

“Ah, is that really okay? Didn’t you just say that the system can’t leave the host?” Stella asked, feeling uncertain.

“Don’t worry! I’m bound to you. No matter where you are, I can always return to your side in an instant.”

“Alright then, you can play here. I’ll keep exercising, but make sure to stay safe, okay?”

“Just you wait and see!” the system replied cheerfully, and soon it noticed a blue butterfly fluttering nearby.

Stella watched as the little cat chased after the butterfly and darted into the maple grove. She couldn't help but mentally warn it from a distance, “Please don’t harm that butterfly! It might be a protected species!”

“Got it!” the system responded, its voice bright and cheerful, though she couldn’t be sure if it really understood her caution.

The little cat zipped through the maple grove, arriving at a scenic water feature. The surroundings were stunning, with lush greenery enveloping a crystal-clear lake. The surface of the water rippled gently, occasionally showcasing flashes of red or golden koi swimming gracefully beneath.

Upon spotting the koi, the system quickly forgot about the butterfly, suddenly eager to catch a fish. But it hesitated, looking around to check if anyone noticed a little cat trying to fish in the water. Strangely enough, despite the beautiful scenery, there was only one person present.

However, what troubled the little cat was that this person seemed to be watching it intently, as if waiting to see what it would do next.
