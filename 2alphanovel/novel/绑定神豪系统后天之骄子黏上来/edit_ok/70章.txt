### The Grand Finale

The Beidou Girl Group, inspired by a series of videos reminiscent of Li Ziqi, had garnered a modest fanbase in the West. However, these fans were especially fond of their "Seven Fairies" series. When Xingchen Entertainment uploaded their stage performances on platforms like YouTube, the Western audience found them somewhat underwhelming.

There were two main reasons for this. 

First, the language barrier kept them from connecting with the lyrics and truly appreciating the songs' beauty. 

Second, Western fans still leaned toward their own musical styles.

Recognizing this, Stella Ling rented a popular local concert venue and began selling tickets online for the Beidou Girl Group's concert. As anticipated, the audience was largely comprised of Asian expatriates—many who had traveled from afar to support their idols.

The concert took a different approach this time, opening with Song Mengmeng singing a Mongolian song solo. Western audiences have shown an affinity for heavy metal and rock but also have a growing appreciation for Mongolian music, particularly throat singing. 

Song Mengmeng initiated with a captivating throat singing piece, accompanied by the haunting sound of the morin khuur. She then transitioned into the beloved Mongolian song "Hongyan." The performance struck a chord with the audience, and the other members of the group joined in with a lively traditional Mongolian dance as accompaniment.

Following this culturally rich introduction, the group shifted to Western songs from the parallel universe, singing and dancing with enthusiasm. They kicked things off with "Love Story," a catchy country-pop tune, followed by the blockbuster hit "Baby." The performance concluded with an emotional rendition of "Auld Lang Syne," during which they sat on stools on stage, facing the audience and pouring their hearts into the song, moving many to tears.

The concert was a resounding success. The Western songs from the parallel universe significantly boosted the Beidou Girl Group's fanbase in the West, transforming previous supporters into devoted followers.

As Stella Ling continued to introduce more Western music, the Beidou Girl Group's popularity abroad skyrocketed. Xingchen Entertainment even initiated a U.S. project to create a sensational adaptation of "Twilight," casting the talented Farisha, who scored an impressive 9.5 in acting, as the lead. 

Although Farisha was Chinese, her Uyghur heritage gave her a unique appearance that resonated with audiences across various cultures. The other group members took on smaller roles, but Stella had already planned future starring roles for them, ensuring their continued rise to prominence.

Once "Twilight" premiered, the Beidou Girl Group attracted a massive following of young fans globally, elevating their fame to unprecedented levels. 

Xingchen Entertainment's rapid success in Hollywood stirred jealousy among American entertainment companies. However, regardless of their attempts to manipulate public opinion or use underhanded tactics to hinder their progress, Xingchen Entertainment consistently launched new hit songs and films, rendering their schemes ineffective.

In addition to her work with Xingchen Entertainment, Stella Ling began establishing other companies. She leveraged her winnings from a system's lottery to produce high-quality cosmetics and instant meal recipes, with the Beidou Girl Group as the spokespeople. These products quickly became bestsellers.

Crucially, the formulas Stella developed were of genuinely high quality, leading to skyrocketing sales. Her investments in the entertainment company finally began to pay off. 

As Stella completed more tasks, the rewards from the lottery grew increasingly high-end, allowing her to expand her enterprises into various industries, including automotive, mobile technology, and healthcare. 

As her wealth grew beyond her needs, Stella became actively involved in various charitable endeavors. Whenever a project required funding, she contributed, earning praise from major state media outlets and leaving her feeling somewhat bashful.

Stella Ling no longer feared the pursuits of any so-called elite suitors. Her worth had surpassed that of their parents, and she was highly regarded by the government, making it impossible for them to pursue her. As long as Stella made it clear she wasn’t interested, there were plenty of people willing to help deflect those advances.

The once-humble Xingchen Entertainment had now evolved into the Xingchen Group. As chairwoman, Stella was the subject of numerous rumors online. Some claimed she was the beloved daughter of a prominent government figure, while others suggested she was the last descendant of a hidden Chinese family abroad, returning at her ancestors' behest.

The most outlandish rumor claimed she was the fabled "Purple Star" descended from the heavens. This rumor began circulating in 2021, suggesting that before 2023, a "Purple Star" would rise in the entertainment industry as a true international superstar.

Initially, this claim was met with ridicule, as many believed the Purple Star was a political figure with no place in the entertainment world. However, once it was associated with Stella Ling, skepticism turned into curiosity. After all, Stella was now the world's richest person, had risen through the entertainment industry, and was actively assisting her country with various challenges.

The most telling detail was that she had founded her first girl group, named Beidou. It was well-known that the Big Dipper (Beidou) was constantly revolving around the brightest Purple Star. 

When Stella saw these claims, she only smiled. She didn’t consider herself a Purple Star. Instead, she believed that anyone helped by the forces of fortune could become this so-called "Purple Star." 

Stella felt the Purple Star represented self-awareness, with dignity and self-reliance being the true essence of awakening. She believed that the Purple Star symbolized not just one person but a collective of awakened souls. After all, one person alone could not change the world; only through the strength of many could the world become a better place.

Standing on a peak in Mianzhu, stroking her now much larger three-colored cat, Stella softly said, “I have a feeling that today I must leave this place.”

“... Your intuition is spot on. Your earthly ties have ended; it is indeed time to return.” 

Fortune paused, then spoke.

In the next moment, the sky suddenly erupted with a brilliant flash of light, and Stella Ling, standing atop the peak, vanished without a trace.

When she opened her eyes again, all her memories had returned. It turned out she was not human at all, but a deity from the divine realm, governing the fortunes of happiness, wealth, longevity, and joy! 

To ascend to a higher divine status, she had reincarnated as a mortal to undergo trials. After successfully passing the trials, her divine status was supposed to elevate from true god to heavenly god. However, due to an error in the underworld, the deity of fortune was unable to return to her divine position, and instead, she was reincarnated as a mortal named Stella Ling.

Since this was a mistake, the deity of fortune was allowed to have her attendant, Fortune, descend as the Celestial Fortune System to protect her. Thus, Fortune was not from the 888 Star Cloud system but a true deity from the divine realm, her loyal attendant.

At this moment, the returning deity of fortune suddenly recalled that those elite suitors chasing after her were also deities from the heavenly realm. They had come down alongside her to gather divine fortunes to help them ascend to higher divine ranks. 

Since they hadn’t succeeded in their quest in the mortal world, they would certainly return to the heavenly realm and continue to pursue her. 

Before they could return to their positions, it would be best for her to take a trip to another world and hide for a while to avoid being tangled up with them again. 

With that thought, the deity of fortune tore through the void with a wave of her hand and flew off to another world to enjoy her freedom.
