**Trial**

Upon discovering the reason behind the commotion, Stella almost stumbled in disbelief.

She certainly didn't expect this to be the cause of her surprise.

Making her way down the familiar streets of her neighborhood, Stella hailed a cab, instructing the driver to take her to the nearest high-end shopping district. 

She was open to exploring any luxury boutiques, whether they specialized in designer jewelry, clothing, or watches.

The driver nodded and skillfully navigated through the bustling city streets, eventually dropping her off at a vibrant commercial area lined with illuminated storefronts.

Stepping out of the cab, Stella headed toward the nearest luxury clothing store. However, as soon as she stepped inside, a staff member halted her.

"Sorry, miss, but we're closing. Please come back another time," the employee said, her smile polite yet lacking sincerity.

Realizing it was late, Stella shrugged off the incident.

As she exited, she noticed a stylishly dressed woman entering the store she had just been turned away from. Curiosity piqued, Stella watched through the glass as the same employee eagerly attended to the newcomer, showcasing dresses with a beaming smile.

Is she someone important, like the store owner or a VIP customer?

Through the window, Stella observed the previously dismissive employee now treating the fashionable woman with utmost respect.

She glanced at the store's listed hours and confirmed her suspicion: the employee had simply refused to serve her.

What a joke! They must not want to make any sales!

Taking a deep breath, Stella looked up at the brand logo above and pulled out her phone to search for "Du Jia Bana."

The top result was about the brand's controversial stance against Asian communities.

Relieved, Stella felt grateful for the snub.

Thank goodness they didn’t serve her. What would her colleagues think if she wore this brand's clothes to work tomorrow? And what about her manager, Mrs. Smith, who was proud of her Asian heritage?

Determined not to let this ruin her day, Stella walked into another nearby luxury store.

This time, it was a brand she had frequented before—Scented Grandmother.

Upon entering, she wasn't met with resistance, but the staff completely ignored her presence. No one approached to assist her or even acknowledged her.

Feeling a bit frustrated, she glanced at her outfit.

She wore a melon green casual top paired with olive green shorts, which together cost nearly a thousand dollars.

When she visited the Scented Grandmother store at a different mall, she wore even more affordable clothes, yet the staff had not treated her this way.

Why was the service so different between locations of the same brand?

With only a limited time to complete her task, Stella decided not to spend her money in a store with poor service.

So, she stepped out and entered another clothing shop nearby.

This time, she wasn't ignored. A neatly dressed woman, around 35, approached her with a welcoming smile. "Hello, miss, welcome to the LV counter. I'm Mrs. Johnson. How may I assist you?"

"Uh, yes, just a moment," Stella replied, quickly pulling out her phone to verify the LV brand's reputation.

Once assured the brand maintained a neutral stance, Stella felt a wave of relief and pointed to a blue short-sleeve dress nearby. "I'd like to buy this one."

Mrs. Johnson swiftly retrieved the dress from the display while smiling warmly. "This is the SCULPTURAL short-sleeve dress, priced at $6,000. It would complement your style beautifully."

"Could you show me to the fitting room after check-out?" Stella asked.

"Of course," Mrs. Johnson nodded, sensing Stella's enthusiasm for the dress.

After completing the purchase, Stella received a notification confirming her task was complete.

But she still had one more task to fulfill. Gesturing to Mrs. Johnson, she said, "Can you help me pick out a bag and accessories to match this dress? Also, put together a few outfits for me. The total shouldn't exceed $130,000, and I need to finish the payment within the next 30 minutes."

Mrs. Johnson's eyes widened in surprise, but her professionalism kicked in.

She had never encountered a customer with such a unique request.

Setting a total price was understandable; it indicated the customer wanted to spend that amount in the store.

But giving a time limit...

This was clearly a test of her skills as a salesperson!

Rising to the challenge, Mrs. Johnson set out to deliver an impeccable shopping experience for this high-spending customer.

She carefully selected a blue PETITE MALLE handbag, matching knee-high boots, and an LV VOLT gold bracelet, along with LOUISF earrings, totaling $17,000.

Next, she chose a white patterned jacket paired with high-waisted black shorts, a black PETITE MALLE handbag, and matching sunglasses and jewelry, totaling $36,000.

The third outfit featured a boxy shirt with tech knit pants, black SILHOUETTE boots, a silver PETITE MALLE handbag, and diamond earrings, totaling $20,000.

For the fourth ensemble, she chose a black printed coat over a knit top and shorts, completing the look with wedge boots and a lavender handbag, totaling $17,000.

Finally, for the fifth set, she selected a double-breasted suit with stylish boots and a SPEEDY handbag, along with gold bracelets and rings, totaling $30,000.

She also suggested two high-end perfumes to round off the selections.

Ensuring the pricing was precise, Mrs. Johnson made sure Stella could purchase everything for exactly $130,000.

As the transaction went through, Stella felt a rush of accomplishment.
