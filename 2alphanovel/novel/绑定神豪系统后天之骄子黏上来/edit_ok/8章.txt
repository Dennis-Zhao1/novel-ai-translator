**Moments on Social Media**

Stella Thompson thought her conversation with the charming guy had come to an end. However, he didn’t leave; instead, he continued to stand beside her, gazing at her intently.

The man towered over her, probably standing at least 6'1". His eyes roamed over Stella's face, and under his gaze, she felt a flutter in her stomach and her limbs grow weak. For a fleeting moment, Stella even entertained the thought that this striking man might be interested in her. After all, why else would he look at her with such warmth?

Stella shook her head vigorously, trying to dispel the unrealistic thoughts racing through her mind. "Get a grip, Stella! Be realistic!"

The handsome guy might just have those captivating eyes that made everyone feel special. She couldn’t possibly think he had feelings for her! What audacity!

But why was he still staring at her? Did she have something on her face? Or was there something odd about her appearance?

“Do you… do you need something?” Stella asked shyly, breaking the awkward silence.

Even if the man was simply lost in thought, Stella couldn’t withstand his unwavering gaze any longer. She had to prompt him to either speak up or move along.

Her question seemed to snap Ethan Reynolds out of his trance. When he finally registered Stella’s slightly flustered expression, he fell silent for a moment before pulling out his phone from his designer bag.

Ethan was even more nervous than Stella at that moment. Though he maintained a calm exterior, inside, he was a bundle of nerves, his palms sweating so much he almost dropped his phone.

“Hi, I’m Ethan. Can I add you on Instagram?”

…

On the way back to her dorm, Stella was lost in thought, still clutching her phone.

She pondered as she walked, even while riding the subway. Climbing the stairs to her dorm, she continued to dwell on it. Why did that handsome guy want to add her on Instagram?

Indeed, Stella had not only exchanged names with Ethan but had also, somewhat inexplicably, pulled out her phone and let him add her on Instagram.

Looking at her phone screen, which displayed a new follow request from "Ethan" with a profile photo of the sky, Stella blinked in confusion.

Why would he want to connect with her?

Unable to make sense of it, Stella decided to seek help online.

After searching for "being added on Instagram by a handsome guy" on a popular forum, she found several posts that echoed her experience.

These were stories of ordinary-looking women suddenly being approached by handsome guys asking for their Instagram.

Curious, she clicked in and read posts where users recounted their encounters, complete with dramatic twists that rivaled the most cliché romance novels!

There were tales of whirlwind romances, unexpected relationships, and even humorous misunderstandings.

Stella swallowed her bite of her sandwich, staring at her phone screen in disbelief. “This has to be exaggerated…”

Scrolling further, she stumbled upon a post that seemed to resonate with her situation.

A title reminiscent of a sensational news article read: “My Experience – Beware of New Types of Scammers: After 30 Days of Online Dating with a ‘Rich Guy,’ I Was Scammed!”

“Scammed! That’s more than I could ever imagine happening!”

After reading the content, Stella felt a chill run down her spine and took a sip of her iced coffee to calm her nerves.

But then she recalled Ethan's appearance and felt it was unlikely.

With looks like his, if he ever entered the entertainment industry, countless admirers would be drawn to him without the need for deceitful scams.

Remembering Ethan's sculpted features, broad shoulders, and tall stature that resembled a model, along with his understated yet luxurious attire, she couldn’t shake the feeling that he was genuine.

Stella bit into her sandwich again and switched back to Instagram, only to find that Ethan had changed his profile picture to a side profile of himself.

In the photo, he looked regal and charming, akin to a charismatic leader straight out of a novel.

“Oh, he posted something new!”

Curious, Stella clicked on it.

It was a photo of a little boy holding up a chicken nugget from a fast-food bucket, with the caption: “My little nephew says it’s delicious, thanks to Miss Stella’s recommendation.”

“...Uh.” Stella was dumbfounded.

She hadn’t recommended anything!

After connecting on Instagram, she had been in a daze, totally unaware that Ethan had been behind her in line.

But as she examined the post’s photo closely, she noticed that he had ordered the same meal as she had.

Could it be that the fast-food staff had suggested he order the same?

Then why thank her?

Stella’s mind was in a whirl.

“Why am I overthinking this?”

Feeling exasperated, Stella closed the Instagram app.

Ethan’s presence inevitably stirred feelings in her heart, a heart that had been untouched for too long.

But she didn’t believe he added her just because he liked her; it was likely he just wanted to make a new friend.

Since there was no real possibility of a romantic connection, Stella decided to stop spiraling into wild thoughts and wasting her energy on this sudden appearance in her life.

He was just a passerby in her life.

Rather than spending time decoding his social media posts, she might as well get some sleep.

Resolved to stop her overthinking, Stella reached for another chicken nugget, only to find the entire bucket was empty except for a serving of fries and a corn on the cob!

Having consumed only one chicken nugget, Stella glared at the little virtual pet cat on her phone, lounging on her desk, licking its paws.

When the virtual pet noticed Stella's gaze, it didn't look sheepish at all; instead, it raised its tiny paw enthusiastically and said, “Stella, I’ll send you some bonus points next time, and we can get this again!”

“...Alright.” Stella nodded in agreement, realizing she hadn’t had enough to eat anyway.

In a fit of annoyance, she bit into the corn on the cob.

Hmph! Next time, she’d buy two buckets—one for her and one for the virtual pet, ensuring it wouldn’t get its paws on her share!

…

“Uncle, are you done yet?”

In a suburban home, a cute seven-year-old boy squatted in front of the coffee table, gazing longingly at the chicken nuggets in his hands.

He had been holding them up for what felt like an eternity—when could he finally eat?

“Yeah, go ahead and eat.” Ethan replied.

He had been staring at his phone’s Instagram feed for the last five minutes.

He had specifically hidden his posts from friends and family, posting something new, yet he hadn’t received a single like or comment from Stella.

Had she not seen it yet?

Ethan clicked on Stella's profile, checking her posts again, only to find them utterly blank, which made him frown with disappointment.

It seemed he was still just a stranger to her…

Ethan felt a pang of hurt over Stella’s lack of engagement with his posts.

Yet, he had no idea that Stella hadn’t hidden her profile from him; she simply never posted anything at all.

At that moment, his little nephew waddled over, munching on a chicken nugget.

“Uncle, honestly, I prefer burgers over nuggets. Can you get me burgers next time?”

Ethan was frustrated with his feelings for Stella and casually replied, “No picky eating.”

“Okay.” His nephew, Benny, pouted and turned his attention back to the family bucket on the table.

Having sent his nephew away, Ethan continued to gaze at Stella’s dandelion Instagram avatar, feeling troubled.

He felt that their progress was too slow and needed to think of other ways to get closer to her.

With a heavy sigh, Ethan realized this was the first time he had cared so much about someone.

Through the living room's large windows, he gazed at the bright moon outside, wondering what she might be doing at that moment.

Had she eaten?

Was she having the fast food she ordered for dinner?

Eating fast food occasionally as a snack was fine, but making it a meal—wasn’t that too lacking in nutrition?

Besides, she had ordered so much!

Was it all for herself or was she sharing with someone?

He felt the urge to make sure she was eating well in the future.

With that thought, Ethan glanced at his little nephew, who was reaching for the family bucket again, and warned, “You’ve already had two pieces. You still need to eat dinner, so no more for you.”

“But there’s still so much left, and I can’t eat it tomorrow…”

“The leftovers will be taken care of by someone else. Now, put down that chicken nugget and go wash your hands.”

“Okay.” Benny reluctantly set down the chicken nugget, licking his lips in regret.

Uncle was so annoying!

He thought he could eat more since his uncle bought so much, but now he ended up disappointed!

…

The next morning, Stella woke up before her alarm went off.

After turning off the alarm, she suddenly realized she didn’t have to wake up so early anymore.

She had acquired a specialized skill in English yesterday and wouldn’t need to get up early to memorize vocabulary.

Stella quickly assessed her knowledge in English and confirmed that she had indeed gained a lot, realizing that her experience from yesterday had been real.

Should she sleep a bit longer?

But as she lay down, she found herself unable to sleep.

It seemed her biological clock was set, so she decided not to overthink it.

With agility, Stella got out of bed to make her bed.

After washing up, she slipped into the comfortable outfit she had bought yesterday, which fit perfectly and felt so comfortable.

Once dressed, Stella gave a gentle scratch to the back of her sleepy virtual pet cat, waking it up.

Seeing the virtual pet in its drowsy state, Stella could already envision waking it up every day in the future.

Aren’t virtual pets supposed to be on standby 24/7?

Why was hers so unique?

It could eat and sleep too.

“Listen up! Today’s daily task is about to be released!”

“Spend $10 within 10 minutes!”

Stella’s eyes lit up at the amount.

Compared to yesterday, today’s daily task amount had increased tenfold.

Would tomorrow’s task be $100?

With pleasant thoughts in her mind, Stella arrived at the breakfast café.

This time, she ordered two boiled eggs, two cups of oatmeal, and six breakfast muffins, which totaled exactly $10.

Stella split the breakfast into two portions, packing one into her bag for her virtual pet to enjoy slowly.

Thanks to yesterday’s fast-food bucket, Stella realized her virtual pet loved snacks, so she made sure to order breakfast muffins today.

Plus, she hadn’t had muffins in a long time because they were a bit pricier, and she usually didn't splurge.

Today, she’d treat herself to a hearty breakfast thanks to the daily task!

However, Stella overestimated her appetite. The filling muffins made her feel full after the third one, and she struggled to swallow even the oatmeal.

Fortunately, the virtual pet didn’t mind that she had taken a bite out of her food and gobbled it down without wasting anything.

Upon arriving at the office, Stella noticed that Lisa, her coworker, was unexpectedly there earlier than she was!

Even though she had taken her time and arrived ten minutes later than usual, seeing Lisa, who usually arrived right on time, was surprising.

Oh, she almost forgot—Lisa had come in early yesterday too and had swapped workstations with her.

Today, Lisa was dressed in a bright orange dress, striking a pose in front of the office windows, looking like a model.

To Stella, this behavior seemed utterly bizarre.

Did Lisa come in early just to pose like a fashion model in front of the windows?

What a strange quirk!

Stella glanced at Lisa before taking her seat.

Since she no longer needed to memorize English vocabulary, she thought she might as well pick up international language studies instead.

After all, she hadn’t memorized a single international word since her college entrance exams, so why not start learning again?

Moreover, international language was universal and could be useful in her future career, so it was worth focusing on.

Stella wasn’t particularly studious and didn’t want to overly stress herself out.

But what if one day the virtual pet decided to leave her?

And what if it took away her newly acquired English skills?

She was inherently an insecure person, and learning additional skills was just a way to secure a backup plan for herself.

Lisa had been standing at the window for half an hour, but the man she had hoped to attract only glanced her way once before moving on.

He didn’t seem as engrossed as he had been yesterday.

What had changed in just a day?

Was it her makeup that made her look less appealing today?

Feeling disheartened, Lisa returned to her workstation and slammed her phone down on the table, startling Stella.

If she could find a better opportunity, she’d never resort to such an obvious and foolish tactic to get Ethan’s attention.

She had matured since her college days and no longer believed the world revolved around her.

Entering society had made her acutely aware of the social status gap between people.

She understood that her middle-class background didn't hold any weight in the eyes of those truly affluent.

Lisa was a person with high aspirations and yearned to rise above her station.

Even if it meant becoming close to someone influential, she wanted the chance to experience the lavish lifestyle of the upper class!

Sadly, despite her strong desires, she had no means to connect with that elite circle.

Even the fact that Ethan often stood in the opposite building, looking out at the street, was a coincidence she had stumbled upon.

An avid follower of the wealthy rankings, Lisa couldn’t possibly not know who Ethan was.

Ethan, the founder of a successful enterprise, was worth an uncountable fortune!

She thought she had captured a golden opportunity, and even if she had to act like a model at the window to attract his attention, she was willing to do so!

But now it seemed that she had misjudged the situation and failed to seize this chance…
