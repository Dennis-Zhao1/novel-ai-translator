**Continuous Efforts**

The buzz surrounding the new girl group, North Star, from Star Entertainment, had taken social media by storm. Even as Labor Day approached, their online presence remained strong, holding the second spot in trending topics. The top spot was reserved for national leaders sending holiday greetings to the country. Competing with that was futile, and everyone knew it.

Instead of discussing the upcoming holiday, most internet users were more interested in North Star's live performance and when they'd grace the stage again. The comments section on Twitter was flooded:

"That wasn't a real live stream! It was barely ten minutes long. Star Entertainment, do you even know what a live stream is? Give us a 100-minute show next time. Don't underestimate us!"

"The girls of North Star are stunning! I'm officially a fan now!"

"Happy Labor Day to everyone! Let's get another performance today!"

"Your music is fantastic! When's the audio version dropping?"

"Seriously, release the audio already!"

……

"I've never seen such a diverse girl group before. Thumbs up!"

"I heard North Star isn't just a mix of different backgrounds; they've got members from all over!"

"From today on, North Star is my Super Star! Happy Labor Day!"

Stella Ling read through the Twitter feed, a smile spreading across her face. Just then, her colleague, Amy, knocked and entered the office. Seeing Stella engrossed in her phone, Amy chuckled. Once Stella looked up, Amy shared some exciting news: "The video of North Star's 'Super Star' has already hit over 3 million views on TikTok!"

"That's awesome!" Stella beamed with joy.

Amy had joined from Snow Cosmetics last month, and Stella had also managed to recruit her friend, Jenny. The two were now part of the marketing team at Star Entertainment, handling promotions just like before.

Stella had hoped to bring her best friend, Anna, on board, but Anna, pursuing a career in international trade, had declined. She was now working for a company in Russia, and they frequently caught up through WhatsApp.

"Amy, make sure to upload our videos to all platforms by 8 PM tonight. Don’t forget YouTube. We need to send North Star's 'Super Star' video there as well," Stella instructed.

"Got it," Amy nodded, hesitating before asking, "Do you think people abroad will get it?"

"Understanding isn't the point; they just need to watch it. There are plenty of people with Chinese heritage living abroad, and I believe this video will definitely catch on," Stella replied confidently.

Even if the international audience didn't immediately understand, they'd be drawn in by the captivating visuals. At 8 PM, Star Entertainment was set to release a video shot by Stella, inspired by a popular lifestyle influencer from a parallel universe.

In that alternate reality, the influencer was a sensation, praised for promoting traditional culture. Stella was determined to create a top girl group and capture global attention, so she couldn't miss out on such a fantastic promotional opportunity!

At 8 PM sharp, Star Entertainment released Stella’s beautifully crafted video across major online platforms.

Emily Lee was a young woman living in the U.S. Her family had moved when she was eight. Growing up, she learned English and Chinese, but adjusting to life in America had its challenges. Now, at 20, she spoke English fluently, yet still missed her childhood home in China.

She longed for her grandparents and friends in China, but her family’s work kept them in the U.S., and they’d even become American citizens. This made returning seem impossible.

On this Labor Day weekend, Emily’s family would usually enjoy mooncakes and call their relatives in China. But she found the mooncakes sold at local stores lacking compared to those she cherished from her childhood.

While Labor Day was about relaxation and celebration, Emily found herself reminiscing and browsing YouTube for videos related to China, hoping to soothe her homesickness.

She stumbled upon an intriguing video thumbnail titled, "Seven Fairies—A Taste of Home." The title sparked her curiosity.

"Meat-filled mooncakes! Just like the ones I had as a kid, but they don’t sell those here!" she thought, excitement bubbling up. Without hesitation, she clicked on the video.

The video opened with a carpet of delicate yellow flowers, which Emily recognized as osmanthus. In the U.S., they reminded her of the bay laurel.

The next scene showed seven girls in beautifully distinct outfits, picking osmanthus flowers. The music was enchanting, exuding a distinctly Chinese vibe. The girls looked ethereal, their flowing robes adding to the mesmerizing scene.

As the baskets filled with blossoms, Emily sighed, "I could watch them pick flowers forever!"

The scene shifted to an osmanthus grove, the gentle sway of the trees captivating Emily. It was stunning.

The girls moved to a charming courtyard filled with vibrant flowers and vegetables, resembling a paradise. They began to divide their tasks: some washed utensils, others gathered fruits and vegetables.

Emily watched as they placed osmanthus, red dates, rock sugar, and some unfamiliar herbs into a large jar.

"Are they making herbal wine?" she wondered. Her dad often bought unusual wines from local stores.

"Using flowers to brew wine? How romantic!" she mused.

The scene transitioned to night. The girls gathered in an old-fashioned kitchen, kneading dough, presumably to make meat-filled mooncakes. Emily leaned in, eager to learn how to make them. As she watched, she couldn’t recognize all the ingredients, so she could only admire the process.

"It's so beautiful! Watching them cook is pure enjoyment!" Emily exclaimed.

As the dough rounds, stuffed with meat, were placed onto a pan, her mouth watered. She could almost smell the aroma.

The video then showcased the finished mooncakes, their enticing appearance leaving Emily in awe.

Then, a bright full moon filled the screen.

The scene shifted to a dining table adorned with mooncakes, dishes, and fruits. The girls gathered, breaking open the mooncakes to reveal their savory filling.

"Wow! I’m about to drool!" Emily exclaimed, eyes glued to the screen.

The video ended with the girls releasing handmade lanterns onto a river, their gentle glow floating away.

As the camera zoomed in on the moon, it revealed glimpses of different cultural celebrations. The girl from the Bai ethnic group, the Korean girl pounding rice, and the Mongolian girl galloping on horseback were all mesmerizing.

The video concluded with North Star performing an enchanting song, "May We All Live Long," under the full moon. The haunting melody and graceful dance left Emily longing for her heritage.

"That was so beautiful! So melodious! I really want to go back to China!" Emily exclaimed, overwhelmed with emotion. She had never felt such a strong connection to a video before.

Determined, Emily decided that after graduation, she'd return to China and embrace her roots, savoring the flavors of her childhood.

On YouTube, the video’s view count was steadily increasing, but in China, it was going viral, captivating audiences across platforms.

In the TikTok comments section, reactions poured in:

"That was stunning! The song is beautiful! National pride is rising!"

"Star Entertainment nailed it! North Star is amazing!"

"They're not just girls; they're like modern-day fairies!"

"The fairy sisters are incredible! I’m a fan!"

"I followed them yesterday! You all are late to the party!"

"Please release the audio version; I want it on repeat!"

"Where was this filmed? The scenery is breathtaking!"

"I was going to spend Labor Day alone, but this video made me feel connected."

"Did anyone else notice the meat-filled mooncakes? I’ve never had one, but I want to try!"

"My cart is full of mooncakes; I’ll be enjoying them soon!"

"Meat-filled mooncakes? I can't even imagine. Aren't mooncakes supposed to be sweet?"

"I’ve tried both sweet and savory; they’re both delicious. This isn’t like the sweet vs. savory tofu debate—I declare it a tie!"

"I’ve heard there are ham mooncakes. Are they good?"

"Ham mooncakes? Sounds intriguing!"

"No, it’s smoked ham! These mooncakes are amazing; I love them!"

"Everyone’s welcome to try them; they’re delicious!"
