**Jewelry Exhibition**

After attending the graduation ceremony and capturing memorable photos, Ivy Greene, with the gentle encouragement of her friend Mia Collins, finally confronted her true aspirations. 

Deep down, Ivy always harbored a dream of venturing into the entertainment industry.

Every time she turned down a scout, she'd secretly regret it for days. However, since starting her junior year, she hadn't come across any new opportunities. She feared her dreams of breaking into showbiz were slipping away. 

But today, unexpectedly, she received an invitation to join the industry—this time from the head of an entertainment company. It was hard not to feel a rush of excitement.

Once Ivy had finished taking her graduation photos, Ethan Carter approached her with a bouquet of champagne roses, congratulating her on her graduation.

“Thank you,” Ivy replied, a shy smile spreading across her face as she accepted the bouquet.

As lunchtime rolled around, the two decided to grab a bite to eat at a nearby American-style bistro. 

After settling into their seats, Ethan perused the menu and asked Ivy what she felt like eating, but Ivy, still feeling a bit overwhelmed, shrugged and said, "I'm good with anything."

So, Ethan ordered a classic Caesar salad, two servings of crispy fried chicken, a hearty New England clam chowder, grilled lamb chops, and a seafood platter. For dessert and drinks, he chose a slice of key lime pie and freshly squeezed lemonade.

Ethan took a sip of the tangy lemonade and bit into the savory lamb chop, then started discussing the scale of Star Entertainment, the benefits for artists, and the general details of the contract they had prepared for newcomers.

Aside from the fact that the company was based in Los Angeles, quite a distance from her hometown, Ivy found herself satisfied with everything about Star Entertainment. However, she needed to talk to her parents before making any commitments.

Ethan understood and they exchanged contact information. Ivy promised to give him her decision the next day.

After their meal and bidding farewell, Ethan initially planned to head out of town. However, he received an invitation from a jewelry sales assistant named Zoe, who had previously assisted him at the Tiffany & Co. store.

Zoe invited Ethan to a high-end jewelry exhibition at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel that afternoon. During the call, Zoe hinted that if Ethan found any pieces he liked, he could make a purchase on the spot.

When it came to high-end jewelry, Ethan recalled the two luxurious sets he'd bought before. With a substantial amount left in his bank account, he wasn’t keen on spending more unless absolutely necessary.

Just then, a notification popped up:

[Daily task released: Spend $10,000 within 30 minutes.]
[Random task triggered: Spend $2 million within 6 hours.]

Well, it seemed fortune was on his side today.

Deciding to check out the jewelry exhibition, Ethan took a cab to the Ritz-Carlton, where Zoe awaited his arrival.

Seeing Ethan step out of the car, Zoe hurried over to greet him. However, noticing Ethan's casual attire—a pair of shorts and a short-sleeve shirt—Zoe momentarily regretted inviting such a VIP to the high-end event.

What Zoe didn’t know was that Ethan was in town during a particularly hot spell, and dressing casually was a necessity to beat the heat.

Zoe composed herself, flashed a welcoming smile, and ushered Ethan into the hotel.

The jewelry exhibition was held on the top floor. As soon as they arrived, Ethan was awestruck by the opulent decor and over three hundred pieces of exquisite jewelry on display. He quickly retrieved his stylish sunglasses from his bag to better examine the dazzling array.

With today's task reward already transferred to his main account, Ethan was left with $2 million to spend.

Seeing Ethan put on his sunglasses with an air of confidence, Zoe was momentarily taken aback, mistaking him for a high-ranking manager. She knew she had to present the showcased jewelry with utmost seriousness.

Ethan listened to her introductions while checking the price tags. Among the 357 pieces, the most affordable was several hundred thousand, and the priciest was a staggering $20 million!

Ethan felt a bit overwhelmed; although he loved jewelry, $20 million was beyond extravagant.

Then Zoe pointed out the most expensive piece, a necklace from a 2015 Tiffany collection, still seeking an owner.

No wonder, Ethan mused. Who would drop so much on a single piece?

While browsing, Ethan's attention was captured by an exceptionally extravagant necklace.

Noticing his interest, Zoe explained, “Mr. Carter, this necklace is from Tiffany’s LEGACY collection, named the Ocean's Embrace. It features five oval cushion-cut Paraiba tourmalines, totaling approximately 473.82 carats, interlinked with diamond and emerald links. It took a staggering 2400 hours to create.”

Gazing at the enormous sky-blue tourmalines, Ethan thought it was too much for his taste.

“Would you like to try it on?” Zoe asked, seeing Ethan's intense gaze.

“No, thank you,” Ethan shook his head. The necklace seemed too heavy; he didn’t want to wear something that felt like a weight around his neck.

He glanced at the price tag: $3.56 million.

So expensive!

Ethan continued his search for a suitable piece to fulfill his task.

Ultimately, Ethan decided to purchase a piece worth $2 million—the Tiffany Legacy Diamond Swan Necklace.

The necklace weighed approximately 20.08 carats, designed with two swans in flight, their heads adorned with pink diamond eyes, surrounded by diamond accents and mother-of-pearl elements. The manufacturing process took an impressive 2000 hours.

When Zoe learned of Ethan's purchase, she was thrilled and quickly assisted him with the transaction.

After completing the payment and receiving the necklace, Ethan placed it directly into his bag.

Concerned for his safety, Tiffany & Co. provided a driver to take Ethan to the airport.

Once on his flight, Ethan began to contemplate his next steps.

The needle on his mental task wheel spun and finally landed on a skill area.

It was the Eye of Insight—just the skill he realized he needed yesterday to better assess the talent around him.
