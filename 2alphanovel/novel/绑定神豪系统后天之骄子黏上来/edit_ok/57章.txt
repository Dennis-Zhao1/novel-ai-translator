Stella Ling, now fully immersed in her role as the president of Celestial Entertainment, read through Feng Xiaocong’s resume with genuine interest. The moment she processed the content, her mind was racing with possibilities.

"Wow, you've trained in martial arts for over ten years?" Stella commented, her voice a mix of admiration and excitement.

Feng Xiaocong nodded, her demeanor still a bit cautious. "Yes, it’s something I’ve been passionate about since I was young."

"That's amazing! We could really use someone with your skills," Stella said, her enthusiasm infectious. "Imagine the unique edge you'd bring to performances. We could create something truly different!"

Feng Xiaocong’s eyes lit up, but she maintained her composure. "I’d love to contribute, but I’m not sure if I fit the typical image of an entertainment artist."

Stella shook her head with a reassuring smile. "You’d be surprised how much audiences appreciate authenticity and unique talents. Plus, I believe in expanding what 'typical' means. Let’s set up a proper interview, and I can introduce you to the team."

The conversation flowed naturally, and Stella noted how Feng Xiaocong’s initial hesitance began to melt away. The two continued to discuss potential roles and ideas, painting a picture of how Feng Xiaocong could fit into Celestial’s vision.

As they walked back towards the office, Stella couldn’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment. It wasn't just about finding talented individuals; it was about building a company culture where everyone felt valued and inspired.

Back at Celestial Entertainment, Stella introduced Feng Xiaocong to the staff, who welcomed her warmly. As they toured the office, Feng Xiaocong began to see herself fitting into this new world—one that valued her skills and offered a platform for her talents.

Later, as the day wound down, Stella reflected on the series of events. The excitement of discovering new talent, the challenges of running a company, and the satisfaction of creating a supportive environment for her artists. It was a lot to manage, but seeing the potential in people like Feng Xiaocong made it all worthwhile. 

And as she prepared to leave for the day, Stella couldn’t help but think about the future. There was something special about Celestial Entertainment, and she was determined to see it shine.
