**Report to President Smith**

Ivy Young sat frozen in her seat, feeling as though her entire worldview had just shattered. 

This was the first time she had ever encountered something like this. It turned out that her classmates were not as friendly as they appeared on the surface. 

Through the resume incident, Ivy had already confirmed that the young woman before her was indeed the president of Star Entertainment. However, signing with a company was such an important decision that she needed to discuss it with her parents first. 

Stella Smith understood and arranged to meet Ivy the next afternoon at the company. 

The next morning, another 55 interviewees arrived at the company, but not a single one had a potential score in the entertainment industry exceeding 9 points. 

Stella felt disappointed, but she quickly reminded herself that they would be signing a new artist that afternoon, which lifted her spirits a little. 

At 3 PM, Ivy arrived punctually at Star Entertainment with her parents. 

Ivy's parents, George and Sarah Young, were not locals; they hailed from a small town in Oregon. 

Ivy was not a day student; she had left school after class yesterday, mainly because she couldn’t stand the subpar food at the school cafeteria any longer. 

Upon hearing that their daughter had caught the attention of an entertainment company, both of her parents took a day off from work and drove to the city the next day. 

Now, seeing the scale of the entertainment company and where their daughter would be living, the couple expressed their satisfaction. 

However, after reviewing the contract their daughter was about to sign, they hesitated. 

Having never seen contracts from other entertainment companies, they couldn’t make a comparison, but the amount listed for the termination fee—$3 million—was staggering. 

They realized they would never earn that much in their lifetime! 

Ivy didn’t feel too worried. She thought about the outrageous termination fees she had read about for top idols online; those amounts were way more than what was written in this contract. Besides, weren’t those top idols able to pay them off with ease? 

Ivy wasn’t sure if she could earn as much as those top stars after entering the entertainment industry, but she was well aware that the current entertainment scene was tough to break into. Only artists who caught the eye of investors or influential figures could thrive in this industry.

She considered herself a lucky girl from an ordinary background, not even majoring in acting, to have caught the attention of the president of an entertainment company. She felt she had no right to be picky.

Moreover, because of the resume incident, she had a particularly good impression of President Smith. 

After all, President Smith didn’t have to help her investigate the resume issue. She could have simply said she didn’t know, and Ivy wouldn’t have pressed the matter further. 

Yet, President Smith took the initiative to help her uncover the truth, revealing the true nature of the classmate who had tampered with her resume. 

President Smith genuinely respected her, which made Ivy eager to sign with Star Entertainment. 

Thinking about this, Ivy took the initiative to persuade her hesitant parents, sharing the story of the resume incident. 

She explained that if it weren’t for President Smith’s visit to the school to scout for talent, she might have forever lost her chance to enter the entertainment industry. 

George and Sarah Young were taken aback after hearing their daughter’s experience. 

Is it really that cutthroat among classmates these days? 

Their daughter had a year left before graduation; would she continue to be targeted by that classmate during this time? 

That student, Jessica Morgan, seemed to be in the same dormitory as their daughter. 

As a father, George wanted to confront Jessica at school and warn her not to bully his daughter. But he hesitated, feeling that as a grown man, it would seem like he was using his size to intimidate a child. 

Moreover, they didn’t have any solid evidence to accuse Jessica of sabotaging Ivy; if the student claimed they were slandering her and demanded proof, they wouldn’t be able to provide it, which would only make their daughter suffer more. 

When Stella Smith learned that Ivy shared a dormitory with the student who had altered her resume, she suggested, “You don’t have to worry about that. If Ivy signs with our company, she can stay in our apartment. The company provides cars and drivers for artists, so she’ll have transportation to and from school.” 

After a moment of consideration, George Young nodded in agreement, standing up with his wife and daughter to express their gratitude, “Thank you for your care, President Smith. Let’s go ahead and sign the contract.” 

In the end, Stella Smith successfully secured Ivy Young, who had a 9.3 score in ethnic dance talent, as a member of her girl group. 

On July 8, the last day of interviews, 33 girls arrived at the company. 

The total number of applicants over the past seven days was 12 fewer than the original notification count, meaning 12 girls who had received interview invitations had stood Star Entertainment up. 

Stella was initially unhappy about this, but when she saw a stunningly beautiful girl from a diverse background among the interviewees, and noticed that her potential score and character rating met her hiring standards, her mood brightened instantly. 

This high-spirited girl was clearly from a multicultural community. 

However, with a 9.5 score in acting ability, should she become a member of the girl group or pursue a career as an actress directly? 

After all, the girl’s talent lay in acting, not in singing or dancing. 

But the communities she came from were known for their rich artistic traditions; surely, her abilities in those areas wouldn’t be lacking, right? 

It was such a dilemma! 

Before even signing her, Stella Smith was already contemplating what path this 9.5-scoring girl should take. 

When it was the turn of the 9.5-scoring girl to interview, Stella entered the small office. 

She took her seat at the interviewer’s desk and watched as the girl introduced herself. 

“Hello, esteemed interviewers! My name is Farrah Reyes, I’m 20 years old, and I’m studying acting at the New York Academy. My specialty is traditional dance.” 

Farrah stood tall, her back straight as she gazed ahead. 

Stella could see that the girl was somewhat nervous and smiled reassuringly, “Farrah Reyes, you don’t need to be nervous. The moment I saw you outside, I thought about signing you.” 

“What year are you in, and does your school allow you to shoot films while studying?” Stella asked. 

She knew that some acting programs had strict management policies that prohibited students from shooting films during their studies, while others were more lenient. 

“We can. Our school has a rule that students can’t shoot films before their sophomore year. I’m currently a sophomore, and after this summer break, I’ll be a junior, so I can start shooting films.” 

Farrah nodded eagerly, but the prospect of being signed by a seemingly important woman only heightened her nerves, making her inadvertently slip into a slight accent when speaking. 

“Alright then, if you want to sign with our company, I can offer you two options,” Stella laid out. 

“First, I can directly guide you on the path of acting, finding scripts and a good filming team for you. You just need to focus on honing your acting skills and filming.” 

“Second, you can join our company’s girl group, perform on stages domestically and internationally, and once you’ve built up a certain fan base, you can transition into acting.” 

“I’ll give you ten minutes to think it over.” 

Farrah considered for only a few seconds before responding, “I’ve made my choice; I want to join the girl group first.” 

Acting directly, even if it was a leading role, who would know who she was? 

There was a risk that her first project could flop. 

Besides, nowadays, the top stars in the entertainment industry were clearly idols who attracted fans more than actors did. 

As long as they had a fan base, it didn’t matter how poorly they acted; their popularity would remain strong. 

Today’s entertainment industry was all about the traffic model; she’d better join the girl group first. 

After all, this manager had just mentioned she would later have the opportunity to act. 

Stella Smith was somewhat surprised but not too shocked, as she knew that the most active figures in the entertainment world today were indeed those who started as idols. 

“Your choice is very wise, and it aligns perfectly with the company's current focus on developing girl groups.” 

“Don’t worry, although we can’t hold talent shows anymore, I’ll invest resources in the girl group that are on par with those of talent shows, ensuring you’ll rise to fame quickly.” 

Stella stood up from her seat, smiling reassuringly. 

With her ability to connect with parallel worlds through her laptop, making such a promise was not at all empty. 

Sitting nearby, Lisa Collins and Zoe Adams exchanged puzzled glances. Wasn’t the president someone who only valued talent and was very picky about looks? 

Why had she decided to sign the girl without even seeing her talent? 

After that, Stella took Farrah out of the interview area and brought her to the top floor of the building to show her the company’s scale before leading her to the temporary office space that served as their apartment. 

“As you just saw, the company is still under renovation, so the living room of this apartment is temporarily used as an office.” 

“However, the soundproofing is excellent, and this apartment has four rooms; one is occupied by girl group member Ivy Young, while the other four members are in the apartment across the hall. There are still three rooms left here for you to choose from.” 

Stella explained. 

Farrah nodded, expressing her satisfaction with the company’s scale and accommodation, but she was more eager to see the contract. 

Stella nodded and took out the contract to hand to Farrah. 

After reading the contract, Farrah realized that the young woman before her was not only a manager but also the owner of Star Entertainment. 

She was pleased with the contract’s content, especially the five-year term. 

Before coming here for the interview, Farrah had also interviewed with several entertainment companies in New York. 

While they were satisfied with her looks, the terms of their contracts for newcomers were far from satisfactory. 

It was either a 10-year or a 15-year contract. 

When Farrah refused to sign with one company due to dissatisfaction with the contract, the manager directly berated her, calling her an outsider who didn’t understand the rules. 

He insisted that all entertainment companies in the country offered such conditions to newcomers, telling her not to be ungrateful and that she’d be throwing away a great opportunity. 

Farrah was not one to be intimidated; she stood up and left that entertainment company, but she spent the rest of the day crying in her dorm after being scolded by an outsider. 

After that, she saw Star Entertainment’s recruitment ads on social media. 

Learning that the company was located in Oregon, she hadn’t planned to come here for an interview, as she preferred to develop in New York or Los Angeles. 

However, Star Entertainment seemed to have spent an enormous amount on advertising, and it appeared in various recommendations on social media, making Farrah feel quite unsettled. 

She closed the app and opened another, only to find more recruitment ads for Star Entertainment! 

Switching to a different platform, she found ads there too! 

Eventually, Farrah relented and decided to submit her resume to this entertainment company on a whim. 

She hadn’t expected that after the interview, she would discover that Star Entertainment offered such great conditions for newcomers! 

The more Farrah looked at the contract, the more satisfied she became, and after getting her parents’ consent over the phone, she signed her name. 

Watching Farrah lean over to sign, Stella Smith couldn’t help but smile broadly. 

Now, the girl group already had six members. 

Stella decided that once they recruited a member who could sing operatic styles, she would stop hiring. 

Seven was a lucky number! 

Since Farrah’s school had an early summer break, she moved into the apartment that night. 

That evening, Stella naturally organized a dinner for the artists and staff, allowing them to meet the new member. 

This time, she arranged for the staff to be in a separate private room while she stayed in the same room with the girl group members, as she had something important to discuss with them. 

Emily Harper felt somewhat restless upon seeing the new addition to the girl group. 

The members recruited by President Smith were all stunning, each more beautiful than the last. 

Was she now the least attractive one in the group? 

Little did Emily know that aside from the straightforward Mia Johnson, the elegant Ivy Young, and the equally lovely Grace Taylor and Kim Hailey, all three felt like they were the least attractive members in the girl group. 

As the three of them battled feelings of inferiority, Stella Smith surveyed the room and cleared her throat. 

“Ahem!” 

“I’d like to know if any of you have objections to cosmetic surgery?” 

Stella announced. 

Emily immediately snapped out of her self-doubt, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Stella, asking, “President Smith, is the company going to provide us with cosmetic surgery?” 

“Yes, but we won’t be doing any major surgeries or random injections. We’ll only be making some minor adjustments. As long as the base isn’t too bad, we can use makeup to compensate for any deficiencies in looks.” 

“I want everyone to have a bit of confidence. The reason I signed you is not just for your looks, but for your talents. I hope the girl group I’m building will stand out based on talent and excellent work, rather than just appearance.” 

As she said this, Stella glanced at Farrah and added, “Farrah, I didn’t sign you just for your looks.” 

What did she see in me then? 

Farrah was filled with confusion, having never showcased her talents to Stella. 

She was left wondering what qualities Stella had recognized in her that led to the signing. 

Farrah felt troubled as Stella didn’t continue the conversation after that, and she didn’t dare to press further. 

“Can I get a nose job, then? President Smith, I think my nose is a bit flat.” 

Mia raised her hand, eager to ask. 

Stella scrutinized Mia’s nose and replied, “No way! Your nose isn’t flat at all! That’s a very tricky area to operate on; best to leave it alone if possible!” 

Mia persisted, raising her hand again to inquire, “Then can I get double eyelid surgery?” 

Stella looked at Mia’s big eyes, puzzled, “But aren’t you already double-lidded? Why would you want to get it done again?” 

“Report to President Smith, my double eyelids are fake!” 

With that, Mia pulled off two clear strips from her eyelids. 

They were double eyelid tapes.
