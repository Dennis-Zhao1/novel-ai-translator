**Searching for the Last Girl Group Member**

After removing her eyelid tape, Ivy rubbed her eyes, and the double eyelid creases disappeared instantly.

Stella Smith observed Ivy, whose eyes seemed to have shrunk a size but remained strikingly large. After a moment’s contemplation, she said with a playful smirk, “If you’re thinking about surgery, I can help set that up.”

Excitement lit up Ivy’s eyes as she pumped her fists in the air. “Thank you, Stella!”

There’s no stopping a woman in pursuit of beauty. Seeing Ivy’s chance for eyelid surgery, the other members eagerly chimed in, expressing their dissatisfaction with various features and discussing the cosmetic procedures they desired.

Jen spoke up, “Stella, what about changing our face shape?”

Stella shook her head with a warm smile. “No way, that’s too risky. Besides, your baby face is your charm! It’s adorable, okay? You and Ivy are just fine with eyelid surgery.”

Mia chimed in, “Stella, I think my whole face needs a makeover!”

Stella countered with a chuckle, “It’s not as bad as you think. You’ve got a bit of nasolabial folds. Fix that, get double eyelids, and maybe reshape your brows, and you’re golden.”

Andy asked, “What about me, Stella? My double eyelids are also taped.”

Stella waved her hand decisively. “Then surgery it is!”

Lara added, “Stella…”

“Your cheeks are too thin. We’ll consult a doctor to see if there’s a safe, side-effect-free way to improve that,” Stella replied warmly.

“Got it~” Lara nodded, satisfied.

“Olivia, what about me?” 

Stella turned to consider the stunning Olivia, with her delicate features and soft lines, reminiscent of a blend of Eastern and Western beauty. Other than her slightly darker skin, she had almost no flaws.

“You just need to lighten your skin and shape your brows,” Stella concluded after a moment’s thought.

Looking around at the group, Stella added, “But remember, I’m no expert. You’ll need to consult with a qualified doctor for specific procedures.”

“Here’s the plan: sort out your passports quickly. Once they’re ready, we’ll head to the best cosmetic hospital in South Korea to see what’s best for you all,” she instructed.

Speaking of which, South Korea is known for having advanced cosmetic surgery techniques. Many parents there gift their children with cosmetic procedures as a coming-of-age present, showing just how mature the technology has become.

Although cosmetic surgery in the States is improving, it still lags behind South Korea. However, a notable downside to South Korea’s procedures is that many resulting beauties look mass-produced—while attractive, they lack individuality.

Stella, who studied Korean in college, often watched Korean dramas to practice, which led her to discover unique-looking Korean celebrities. Recently, she’d researched cosmetic surgery online and learned that some of her favorite distinctive Korean actresses had undergone procedures but retained their charm.

This proved that there were indeed top-tier plastic surgeons in South Korea who didn’t stick to a cookie-cutter approach. But, as a foreigner, she might not easily find such doctors.

If only her keen insight could help her recognize a surgeon’s skill level!

With the prospect of going to South Korea for cosmetic procedures, the girls buzzed with excitement, momentarily forgetting their meals as they dove into discussions about the opportunities there.

Andy led the conversation, having lived in South Korea for five years and trained as a trainee in a well-known entertainment company. She was undoubtedly the most knowledgeable about the Korean entertainment scene among the group.

Stella contemplated asking Andy about the cosmetic hospital associated with a famous company. However, she ultimately decided against it, as her online research showed that she wasn’t fond of the styles of that company’s artists post-surgery.

Stella preferred the looks of another company’s idols. Yet, overall, she found the beautiful actresses from South Korea more aligned with her aesthetic standards than their idols.

The next day, Stella bought a ticket and flew to New York City.

Now, the girl group only needed one member skilled in acting, and she needed to recruit quickly before heading to South Korea for their transformations.

Upon arriving in New York City, Stella took a cab straight to the New York Academy of Performing Arts.

This academy allowed public visits, so Stella registered with her ID at the security desk and entered the school.

It was Saturday, and with no classes, students were everywhere. As Stella listened to the conversations around her, she realized it was graduation day for the class of 2018.

That explained the bustling atmosphere—it was like a festival!

What a stroke of luck! She could take advantage of the graduation ceremony to scout potential candidates among the graduates.

The 2018 graduates were likely around her age, mostly 23 years old. Initially, she planned to recruit members aged 18 to 22, but she figured a year older wouldn’t hurt.

After exploring every corner of the school, Stella had her eye on a girl dressed in a graduation gown, boasting an impressive potential score of 9.3, expertise in theater, and a top-tier personality rating.

The girl, with her classical beauty, captivated Stella.

“Hi, I’m Stella Smith, the president of Star Entertainment. Your look perfectly fits our criteria for recruiting talents. After the graduation ceremony, can we have a chat?” Stella approached the girl, who was taking photos with her classmates, and smiled.

Hearing this, Emily hesitated, glancing at her friend beside her.

Seeing her friend give her a gentle nudge to encourage her, Emily finally nodded and replied, “Sure.”

As they settled into the auditorium to watch the graduation performances, Emily’s mind was elsewhere, preoccupied with the earlier conversation.

“Anna, do you think I should enter the entertainment industry?” she leaned closer to her friend and whispered.

This wasn’t her first encounter with a talent scout; she had declined previous offers.

Emily’s parents hoped she would stay at the academy as a teacher or join a theater, pursuing a career in drama. They wanted her to have a stable job, not to enter the chaotic entertainment world.

“Of course you should! The entertainment industry pays well! And it’s not as easy to break into as it used to be. Nowadays, popular artists are often the children of wealthy families. For common girls like us, making it in this industry is incredibly rare!” Anna urged, feeling frustrated that her friend had turned down several talent scouts in the past.

She couldn’t let her friend miss this opportunity again!
