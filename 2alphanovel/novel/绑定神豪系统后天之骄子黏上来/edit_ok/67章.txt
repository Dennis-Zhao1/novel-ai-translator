**Official Debut**

In the blink of an eye, 51 days had passed.

During this nearly two-month span, Stella White had completed a total of 51 daily tasks, 8 weekly tasks, 2 monthly tasks, and 5 random tasks, amassing a staggering fortune in task funds.

Throughout this period, Stella had also won two cash prizes from the system's lottery, amounting to a considerable sum. Additionally, she received two physical rewards in the form of exclusive black gold cards with limited usage rights, as well as formulas for skincare products: a blackhead removal cleanser, an acne gel, a spot-fading essence, and a moisturizing mask.

There was also an unexpected reward: a quick-cook recipe, a year-long subscription to a premium service, a permanent usage card for a laptop that connects to parallel dimensions, and even a retired special forces soldier as her bodyguard, all categorized as tangible rewards.

The retired soldier, named Jack Foster, was a real person living in this world. Stella had hired him as her bodyguard for a significant salary, covered by the Celestial Fortune System.

The most crucial point was that Jack would be utterly loyal to Stella, never betraying her trust. The system had assured Stella that this bodyguard was exceedingly capable and would ensure her safety from all angles.

Since Stella didn’t have to pay Jack’s salary out of her own pocket and he wasn’t one of the so-called "Heaven’s Chosen Ones," she was more than happy to have such a talent by her side, especially as her assets were steadily increasing.

To further ensure the safety of her company and its artists, Stella had also recruited a team of retired soldier bodyguards through Jack’s connections. While this new group might not match Jack’s prowess, they were more than adequate for maintaining the security of the company and its artists.

With the help of the laptop connecting to parallel dimensions, Stella had already uncovered three popular songs by a girl group from that alternate reality and had her company’s music producer recreate these songs.

Now named the "Big Dipper" girl group, under the guidance of vocal coach Lisa Jennings, the seven members had learned these three songs and were also mastering the choreography designed by dance instructor Tony Reed.

In the luxurious indoor sports hall located in the high-tech zone of River City, construction had rushed ahead day and night at Stella’s financial urging, and it was completed two weeks ahead of schedule.

The Big Dipper girl group had been rehearsing intensely for one week within the opulent sports hall, focusing on one of their songs.

Today marked the official debut of the Big Dipper girl group, and Emily Carter and the seven members were all feeling the pressure.

Fortunately, today’s debut would be broadcasted through television and online platforms, so they wouldn't have to face a live audience, otherwise, they were genuinely worried about messing up during the filming.

“You’ve got this! You’re all amazing!”

As the time for the official filming drew near, Stella could only manage to say this one encouraging line to the nervous girl group members, as she too was feeling the jitters.

The filming was set to take place at 8 PM tonight, simultaneously broadcasting on a popular TV network and three live streaming platforms: TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.

Stella had spent a huge sum on advertisements across these platforms for over half a month, and tonight would be the moment of truth.

“You’re amazing too!”

Suddenly, Tony Reed, who stood beside Stella, placed a hand on her shoulder.

With a smile in her eyes, Tony looked at Stella.

Initially, Tony had doubted that the woman before her could provide a bright future for Emily. However, ever since Stella presented those three songs, she had completely acknowledged Stella’s capabilities and had no remaining doubts.

Tony believed that the Big Dipper girl group, meticulously crafted by Stella, would become an overnight sensation tonight.

“Thank you!”

Stella replied gratefully, yet her heart was still racing with anxiety.

Even if the live broadcast didn’t achieve the expected results, she planned to enhance their online presence tonight, ensuring that the internet knew about the Big Dipper!

Meanwhile, Emily’s father, James Carter, was lounging on the sofa in front of the television.

Every day, James would tune in at 7 PM to watch the news broadcast, followed by the weather report. After that, he would relinquish the remote to his wife, allowing her to indulge in her favorite shows.

However, after watching the weather report today, James inexplicably lingered in place, changing the channel to his wife’s favorite network.

Just as Sarah, who had just finished showering, entered the living room, she couldn’t help but chuckle upon seeing her husband still seated on the sofa.

Sarah watched as her husband, who clearly wanted to watch their daughter perform but was trying to play it cool, decided not to call him out on his pretense.

Thinking back to the video call with Emily two days ago, where she mentioned signing with a new entertainment company, Sarah felt a mix of happiness and worry. She wondered if her daughter had taken out a loan for any enhancements and if this new company might pressure her into unfavorable situations.

As if reading her mind, James voiced his concerns.

Sure enough, the father-daughter pair had a heated argument through video call. However, this time, Emily didn’t hang up mid-fight; instead, she shared details about her new entertainment company once her father had calmed down.

James’s expression softened considerably when he heard that their daughter had signed a five-year contract and that the company’s owner was a woman only a few years older than Emily, who was friendly and kind.

Upon learning that the company had covered Emily’s expenses without her having incurred any debt, Sarah felt a wave of relief wash over her.

Soon, the couple learned that their daughter would be debuting on television in just two days, and they couldn't help but feel excited.

Their daughter, Emily, was truly going to be on television, becoming a star!

Sarah wanted to rush to share the good news with their eldest daughter, Olivia, who was working far away in New York City, but she found out that Emily had already informed her sister long ago.

Sarah felt a twinge of jealousy; her youngest daughter seemed to have a better relationship with her older sister than with her. Still, her heart swelled with joy for Emily.

At last, Emily was going to fulfill her dream and step onto the stage!

After that phone call, James awkwardly insisted that he wasn’t interested in watching any debut performances.

Yet as 8 PM approached, signaling the start of their daughter’s televised performance, he was already grumbling to himself about being forced to watch it.

Sarah sat down next to James, clearly sensing his discomfort. She stifled her laughter, choosing to treat her husband like air, allowing him to squirm in his own awkwardness.

Lydia was glued to her phone, anxiously watching the countdown.

There was only one minute left until her friend Chloe’s debut performance was about to begin, and she was determined to support her on time.

As the seconds ticked down from 59 to 00, Lydia quickly clicked into the live stream titled "Star Entertainment."

Upon entering, she was greeted by darkness, which slowly faded away to reveal seven stylishly dressed girls standing still on a dazzling stage.

Suddenly, seven beams of light shot down from above, illuminating the seven girls on stage.

Then, the beautiful sound of a violin began to play. The previously motionless girls seemed to come alive, moving rhythmically to the vibrant beats of jazz drums and electric guitars.

Stepping forward to the center was Chloe, who began to sing:

“Laugh, just sing,
A frown brings heartache.”

Next, Hannah stepped up, moving her body as she harmonized:

“I’ve got no time to lose,
Only feeling your feelings.”

Emily sang:

“Where are you going,
Taking my soul along?”

Sophie followed:

“It’s enchanted by you,
What’s the use of holding onto it?”

As the song reached its climax, the seven girls raised their hands, pointing forward, dancing and singing in unison:

“You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.”

Following the chorus, the girls danced in perfect synchronization, shifting formations.

It was Grace’s turn as she stepped into the center, singing:

“Hands are not just hands,
They are the gentle universe.”

Bella chimed in:

“My little planet,
Spins in your hands.”

Rachel added:

“Please see me,
Let me have dreams to chase.”

The high notes were still sung by Sophie:

“I've lost my mind for you,
You must reward me.”

Again, the synchronized girl group sang together:

“You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.”

With a change in choreography, Rachel stepped to the front and sang:

“You are the meaning,
Heaven and earth, the will of the gods.”

Then quickly shifting, Sophie took center stage, singing:

“Besides loving you,
There is no truth.”

Chloe and Grace sang a duet:

“Fire, you are fire,
The end for my moth.”

Hannah and Bella followed with their duet:

“I never thought to escape,
Why should I escape?”

Emily and Rachel sang together:

“Thank you for giving me
A joyful dream journey.”

Sophie concluded:

“If I forget myself,
Please help me remember.”

They all joined in for the final chorus:

“You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.
You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.”

Sophie finished with a flourish:

“You are my superstar, boy!”

As the song came to an end, the seven girls stood in a row, bowing at a 90-degree angle towards the camera.

Lydia felt goosebumps cover her body.

She had a strong premonition that this girl group, the Big Dipper, was destined for stardom, and her friend Chloe would skyrocket to fame!

Even though the live stream had ended, the comments section remained flooded with messages.

“Oh my god! I’m going crazy! Are these seven girls angels sent to save my eyes and ears?”

“I suddenly feel like I have no regrets in life.”

“This is the best stage performance I’ve seen this year; whether it’s the songs, the dances, or the camera work, everything is just fantastic!”

“Is American entertainment about to rise?”

“Wait, didn’t one of them look like a foreigner?”

“That’s not a foreigner! She’s representing American diversity; she’s one of us! The Instagram ad had her introduction; her name is Bella Khan!”

“Wow! I used to be annoyed with Star Entertainment for their ads everywhere! Now I get it! This company is amazing! Thank goodness they advertised so much; if I had missed tonight’s live stream, I would have regretted it for life!”

“I remember Star Entertainment was recruiting artists a few months ago; it's only been a short time, and those who auditioned are already performing? This company is incredible!”

“I should have auditioned! I also want to stand on that stage!”

“I heard it’s hard to get selected; many who went for interviews complained online that the interviewers were super picky, harder than any talent show!”

“Guess I’ll just enjoy watching these beautiful girls perform!”

“Why is there only one performance? I want to see more!”

“Everyone hurry! Star Entertainment has posted a recording of the live stream on Instagram; go watch it!”

“Ah! I’m going to watch!”

Stella White watched as the comments began to slow down. She let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding.

By now, she hadn’t seen a single negative review.

Could it be that the Big Dipper girl group's debut performance was a success?

She turned her gaze back to the stage, where Emily was crouched down, holding her phone and crying, while the other members comforted her with teary eyes.

“The stage performance was a great success! You’re all the best!”

Stella shouted excitedly towards the stage.

Upon hearing her words, Emily stopped crying, and along with the other members, rushed off the stage to envelop their boss in a joyful embrace, tears mingling with laughter as they shared this moment of elation.

That night was destined to be an insomniac’s night.

The trending topics about Star Entertainment's Big Dipper girl group skyrocketed across major online platforms.

Initially, the entertainment company had planned to buy the top trending spot, spending a hefty sum to try and push Star Entertainment off the number one position, but they failed miserably.

Other entertainment companies could only watch helplessly as Star Entertainment soared to the top of all platforms.

Sophie’s former manager, Mark Weston, glared at the top trending topic on social media, unable to hold back his frustration. “Damn it, they really have money!”

Even with several entertainment companies teaming up to suppress them, Star Entertainment firmly held the number one trending spot. Remembering how that young woman had swiftly paid the termination fee, Mark couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness.

He had truly believed in Sophie’s potential, but a struggling company like Rising Star probably wouldn’t have the funds to produce any quality music for her.

Sigh, perhaps it was for the best.
