**Through the Window**

Stella Parker and Lisa Smith now found themselves working at the same company, officially becoming colleagues. Lisa, with her usual boldness, took the initiative to greet Stella, who could no longer ignore her as she had during their school days.

Having shared a dorm for four years, Lisa had always looked down on Stella for her humble background. Over the years, Stella had silently endured countless jabs and taunts from Lisa, leaving her with a deeply negative impression of her former dorm mate. Their relationship had deteriorated to the point where they felt more like strangers than acquaintances.

The other two roommates, though not as close to Stella, were openly antagonistic towards Lisa. Stella still vividly remembered the first day they moved into the dorm. Lisa's parents came to help her settle in and made an offhand remark to the three roommates.

"Our Lisa has been spoiled by us since she was little. We hope you can take good care of her as roommates. We’re all classmates, after all. Let’s help each other out."

Freshly arrived at university, Stella and her two roommates nodded in agreement, all eager to have a peaceful four years together. Ideally, they hoped to develop friendships along the way. However, things didn’t go as they’d wished. Lisa’s temper was intolerable, and no one could bear it except her doting parents.

Who could have predicted that on the very first day, Lisa would treat her roommates like servants? She constantly demanded favors, from fetching water to bringing her meals, while never lifting a finger to help with their dorm duties. Even when it came to throwing away her own trash, she expected others to do it for her.

Whenever Stella and the others needed Lisa’s assistance, she always found excuses to refuse. This one-sided dynamic of giving and taking was tolerable for a time, but it soon became clear that she viewed her roommates as mere tools to serve her whims.

What made matters worse was Lisa’s blatant regional discrimination, flaunting her status as a local and deriding Stella and her roommates as outsiders. The superiority complex radiated from her, reflected in her every interaction.

Unlike Stella, her other two roommates had parents who were very much alive and had been pampered themselves; they were not willing to endure Lisa’s commands. After discussing it, Stella, along with the dorm leader Jessica and the other roommate Lucy, decided they would no longer indulge Lisa.

Stella was the first to stand her ground against Lisa. After Lisa experienced her first defeat in the dorm, she launched into a tirade of passive-aggressive remarks. Stella felt an urge to retort, but she had always been somewhat tongue-tied and had never been one to use harsh language.

As Lisa pointed fingers and hurled insults, Stella appeared flustered on the outside, while internally she wished someone would step in and stand up for her. Luckily, Jessica and Lucy quickly came to her defense, helping to push back against Lisa’s theatrics.

In the end, the three of them united against Lisa, firmly telling her to stop bothering them and to fend for herself. This confrontation fueled Lisa’s resentment, leading her to spread false claims among classmates that she was being bullied by her roommates. She even escalated the situation to their advisor.

Unlike her treatment of Stella and the others, Lisa was overly friendly with the advisor and her professors, charming them with flattery and maintaining a good relationship. However, the advisor, while on friendly terms with Lisa, was a professional who wouldn’t simply take her word for things.

After investigating the matter, the advisor realized that Lisa was in the wrong, and that the fault did not lie with Stella and her friends. Eventually, they were all called into the advisor's office for a talk, where they were urged to resolve their differences amicably.

The resolution leaned in favor of Lisa, but her reputation among the students had soured. Those who had interacted with her knew she was a melodramatic princess who maliciously slandered her roommates. No one wanted to associate with someone like that.

Shaking off those memories, Stella refocused on the vocabulary notebook in front of her. It was essential to use her time wisely to study and improve herself, and she had no interest in why Lisa had arrived at the office so early that day.

However, while she tried to concentrate, Lisa approached her, blocking the sunlight streaming in from the window.

“Is there something you need?” Stella asked, raising her eyes with an indifferent expression.

“Hey, Stella, it must be really sunny for you sitting here, right?” Lisa forced a smile, her lips painted with bright pink lipstick.

Stella's desk was positioned by the window, and at first, she had felt the harsh rays of the sun during midday, but she had grown accustomed to it over time. Why was Lisa asking about her comfort? Was she looking for a reason to pick a fight?

Stella recalled how during the office layout selection, Lisa had quickly claimed the inner desk, leaving the sunny spot for Stella while smugly warning her, “Be careful, or you’ll end up tanned like a piece of toast!” That moment was still fresh in Stella’s mind.

“What does it matter to you? Just leave me alone,” Stella replied coldly, returning her focus to her studies.

Lisa’s smile faded, and her irritation bubbled up. “Hmph! Who’s bothering you? I just wanted to know if you wanted to switch desks!”

Stella looked at her quizzically. “Switch with whom? With you?”

“Yeah,” Lisa nodded, her eyes sparkling with expectation.

Stella felt confused. Was Lisa really trying to get a tan?

Though she sensed something odd about the desk switch, she couldn’t pinpoint any suspicious motive, so she opted to decline.

“No thanks, I’m fine where I am.”

After being rejected, Lisa didn’t give up; instead, she half-squatted next to Stella, wrapping her arms around Stella’s, whining that if she didn’t agree to switch, she would stay there and prevent Stella from studying.

Stella felt goosebumps rise at Lisa’s overly sweet tone. If Lisa had insisted on switching desks, Stella might have argued back, but with her current approach…

Reluctantly, Stella complied to avoid further annoyance, reasoning that she wouldn’t lose anything in the exchange.

The two of them had minimal belongings, and it didn’t take long to switch their desks.

“I’m only doing this once, no repeats,” Stella declared firmly as she settled into her new spot.

Lisa smirked at her words, replying mockingly, “Of course there won’t be a second time.”

Having achieved her goal, Lisa reverted to her usual condescending demeanor. Stella rolled her eyes internally, reopening her vocabulary book and shutting Lisa out of her thoughts.

Time ticked by, and as the office started to fill with colleagues, the noise level rose. Stella closed her book to find Lisa no longer at her desk but standing by the window, staring intently outside.

It was late May, and the summer sun was already blazing by 9 AM. Why was Lisa, who usually took sun protection seriously, standing there now?

Oh right, she had just insisted on switching desks. Clearly, she didn’t mind the sunlight.

What could Lisa be staring at with such focus?

Curiosity piqued, Stella stood up and followed Lisa’s gaze. With her slight nearsightedness, she didn’t need glasses just yet, but when she peered through the glass, she saw a man across the street in an office building, dressed in a crisp button-down shirt and black trousers.

He was also looking out the window, but not in their direction; instead, he was sipping coffee while observing the street below, appearing casually relaxed. Stella could only make out his general silhouette, but he seemed to have a good figure.

Was Lisa watching him?

From that distance, she couldn’t even see his facial features; surely it couldn’t be that she was interested in him…

Suddenly, the man seemed to notice someone looking at him as he lifted his gaze toward their direction. Then, out of nowhere, he produced an object and brought it to his eyes.

Was that… a pair of binoculars?

Realizing what he was holding, Stella quickly sat back down at her desk.

But Lisa, rather than retreating, leaned against the window, one hand on the glass and the other on her hip, striking a pose.

Was Lisa trying to impress that man with her antics?

Did they know each other?

Lisa continued to change her poses, striking a variety of alluring stances while Stella sat there, utterly speechless.
