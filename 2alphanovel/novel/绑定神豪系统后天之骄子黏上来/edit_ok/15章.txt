**Future Sister-in-Law**

As Leonard Young came rushing over, his plump figure jiggled with each step, and Lucas Martin quickly approached to stop him. "Watch it! Don't spill the food!"

"Got it!" Leonard replied cheerfully, slowing his pace and beaming with a smile as he explained, "Don’t worry, Lucas! These meals are packed securely, so nothing will spill out!"

Lucas took the paper bag and asked, "Which one is for her?"

"The one on top," Leonard answered.

After getting his answer, Lucas grabbed the bag and started walking. It wasn’t until he reached the hospital room that he noticed Leonard was still trailing behind him.

"Why are you following me?" Lucas frowned at the chubby man behind him.

"I’m just worried you might need help later, so I thought I could stick around," Leonard said, scratching his head and smiling, looking quite endearing.

Lucas considered it for a moment before nodding. "Alright, wait outside then. I’m afraid you’ll overwhelm her."

"Overwhelm who?" Leonard asked curiously, feeling a bit hurt. He was just a little overweight; surely, he wasn’t that overwhelming!

"Your future sister-in-law," Lucas said, a smile of happiness spreading across his face.

Seeing the blissful grin on Lucas's face, Leonard was taken aback, even stepping back in shock.

Oh my gosh! 

When had the notorious playboy Lucas ever shown such a sweet smile?

This is terrifying!

In the past, whenever Lucas introduced a new girlfriend to their group, he’d simply say it was his current partner, never even mentioning the word "girlfriend." To him, those women were merely fleeting interests—never equals.

It looked like Lucas had really fallen this time!

He had jumped straight from the title of “girlfriend” to “sister-in-law”!

"What’s with that expression? You don’t believe me?" Lucas asked, slightly annoyed at Leonard’s reaction.

Leonard quickly composed himself and straightened up. "Of course I believe you! But if she’s your future sister-in-law, we’ll need to meet eventually. Lucas, why don’t you take this chance to introduce her to me?"

Hearing “sister-in-law,” Lucas smiled even wider. Then, as if recalling something, he confirmed, "Leo, you didn’t go out with us last night, did you?"

"Nope, I was with my girlfriend," Leonard replied.

"Alright, let me introduce you to your sister-in-law then."

Lucas nodded, thinking that since Leonard wasn’t at the party last night, and since Ivy hadn’t met him, she probably wouldn’t be overwhelmed.

But then he remembered that Ivy was currently unwell and needed rest. He decided it would be better to introduce them later on. So, he told Leonard, "No, you shouldn’t go in; she’s sick and doesn’t have the energy to meet you right now. I’ll introduce you later, just wait outside."

Without giving Leonard a chance to respond, Lucas grabbed the paper bag and entered the hospital room, leaving Leonard outside.

Feeling dejected, Leonard stared at the closed door. 

What kind of illness could it be? As long as it wasn’t serious, meeting someone shouldn't take that much energy, right?

Still, Leonard sensed from Lucas’s reaction that this time, Lucas might truly be in deep!

He had never seen Lucas so anxious about anyone before!

Once inside the room, Lucas personally set up the dining table for Ivy Summers, arranging the dishes meticulously without letting her lift a finger.

Since entering the hospital, Ivy had been cared for entirely by Lucas. At this point, she had lost the energy to question his motives for treating her so well. 

Perhaps he genuinely wanted to apologize.

The delicious aroma of the food wafted through the air, and Ivy’s stomach growled softly in response. 

She looked at the two stews and three porcelain plates laid out on the table and realized that apart from the bowl of plain porridge, she hadn’t tried any of the other dishes before.

Ivy picked up a spoon and scooped some chicken soup from the stew of black-boned chicken. As the warm liquid touched her lips, the rich flavor exploded in her mouth, complemented by a subtle fragrance reminiscent of herbs. It was delicious!

Next, she picked up her fork and took a bite of the black-boned chicken, discovering that it was far tastier than regular chicken. The meat was firmer, the flavor more robust, and it even had a hint of sweetness.

Ivy had seen black-boned chickens before; her grandmother’s neighbor used to raise a few. 

Some of those chickens were all white except for their black faces, while others were completely black, looking like little pieces of coal with bright, shiny eyes. They were much smaller than ordinary chickens, yet she found them uniquely beautiful, elegant, and mysterious.

Today, as she tasted black-boned chicken for the first time, she fell in love with it, thinking it was not only pretty but also far more delicious than fried chicken!

"System, I’ll save half of this chicken soup for you. It's even better than any restaurant!" 

Excited to share her joy, Ivy thought to her closest companion.

[No, no, no!] 
[Ivy, you’re sick right now, and you should eat more good food to recover faster! Once you’re better, we can use the task funds to buy more food!] 

The system struggled against its cravings, trying to suppress the sound of drooling while replying.

"Then I’ll just eat it all myself." 

Ivy felt a bit guilty; she usually shared her food with the system, but today it was all hers, and she felt a little bad about it.

However, the system was right! 

If she wanted to eat something later, she could use her task funds to buy it herself!

With this thought, Ivy happily continued eating.

The black-boned chicken soup, bird’s nest porridge, braised beef brisket with fish maw, and steamed pumpkin with lily bulbs were all delicious. The desserts were a platter of goji berry and gelatin cake and purple sweet potato and yam cake.

Lucas watched the dishes on the table and nodded to himself, recognizing they were all nourishing dishes suitable for women.

Seeing Ivy enjoying her meal, Lucas felt satisfied and decided to dig into his own portion of the cuisine.

However, upon seeing what was in his bowl, his expression immediately darkened.

Lamb tail soup, a nourishing porridge, steamed soft-shelled turtle, and shrimp with chives, with desserts of chestnut cake and crispy cashews.

What the hell! Wasn’t this the kind of meal meant to boost energy?

What was Leonard trying to imply?

When he said to order whatever, it wasn’t supposed to be like this!

Did he really need supplements in that area?!

Lucas felt like he was about to explode, but with Ivy there, he could only simmer down his anger for now.

Noticing his change in demeanor, Ivy looked at him with concern. 

Seeing Lucas glaring at his food with such a grim look, she kindly asked, "Is it not to your taste? I haven’t touched anything other than the chicken soup. We could switch if you want."

"N-no, it’s fine." 

Lucas quickly waved his hand in refusal, trying to cover up his discomfort. "I’m just not hungry yet; I’d like to eat later."

Seeing that he didn’t want to switch, Ivy didn’t press the issue and continued to enjoy her meal.

Lucas sighed in relief but couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about the dishes in front of them.

Could it be that Ivy's dishes were meant to pair with his?
