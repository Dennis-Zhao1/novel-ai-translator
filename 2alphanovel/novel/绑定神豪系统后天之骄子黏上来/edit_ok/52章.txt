**Insightful Gaze 2.0**

Ethan Turner was so furious he was almost speechless. Just because he had money, he felt he was invincible!

Ten minutes later, Ethan reluctantly signed his name on the contract for Megan Song's termination. 

As he noticed the agent from Stellar Entertainment glaring at him with hostility, Ivy Lane realized that her chances of touring the agency any further were slim. Grabbing the contract, she took Megan and left the company.

After reuniting with June Carter, Ivy knew she had to help the two girls pack their belongings from their rented apartments. First, they headed to June’s place. At just 19 years old, June’s room was sparse, with only a single suitcase’s worth of items.

Next, they visited Megan’s apartment. This 20-year-old also had minimal luggage, easily fitting everything into one suitcase. However, as they were about to leave, they encountered a small obstacle.

To be precise, someone was trying to introduce themselves to Ivy.

“Megan, I just heard from the company that you’re terminating your contract. Could you take me with you?” Lily suddenly burst out of her room, dressed in a nightclub ensemble, making her plea to Megan.

Although Lily aimed her words at Megan, her gaze kept darting toward Ivy, her eyes betraying a glimmer of hope.

“I can’t decide that…” Megan felt awkward and turned to Ivy, seeking her opinion.

Receiving the look, Ivy glanced at the attractive Lily, noting the time left on her Insightful Gaze ability—just half a minute. She assessed Lily’s appearance.

A score of 7.5 for looks.

Ivy slowly shook her head; Lily was not the kind of artist that Star Entertainment needed.

Disappointment flooded Lily’s heart immediately. If this woman, who seemed to be Megan’s new manager, had outright rejected her, then no amount of begging Megan would change that.

Lily, not recognizing Ivy as the young woman who had recently bought an emerald jewelry watch at a luxury store, scrutinized her appearance, concluding that Ivy dressed rather plainly, leading her to suspect that Megan’s new company might not be as strong as Stellar.

Even if it wasn't as formidable, it was still someone she, as a trainee, couldn't afford to offend. Despite being turned down, she could only muster a forced smile and offer her blessings. “I guess I’m just not meant to be part of this. Megan, I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.”

“...Thank you.” 

Megan replied softly, her feelings complex. Since she had declined to join Lily at a party last time, Lily had not spoken to her again.

Now, unexpectedly, Lily was starting a conversation just as they were parting ways.

With a heavy heart, Megan followed Ivy and the others as they left the apartment.

Noticing Megan's downcast demeanor, June guessed it might have something to do with Lily and quietly offered her some comfort.

It was difficult for friendships formed during their trainee days to last a lifetime. Moreover, friendships in the entertainment industry were often based on interests; countless examples showed that when interests clashed, friends could quickly become foes.

Therefore, friends who departed due to interests weren't worth dwelling on because no amount of concern could change their nature—only bring oneself pain.

Hearing the comforting words from behind, Ivy nodded in satisfaction. She hoped that June and Megan, as a duo, would get along harmoniously and become friends.

Ivy didn’t want to see the members of the group she planned to debut become strangers to each other, which would lead to endless fan battles once they gained their own followers. She wanted to create an international pop girl group, not a daily rap showdown.

Ivy took the two girls on a flight to the company headquarters located in Portland, Oregon.

Upon arriving in Portland, June and Megan were both shocked at the accommodations provided by Star Entertainment for its artists.

A 400-square-meter elegant and luxurious serviced apartment with four bedrooms, two living rooms, and six bathrooms, exquisitely decorated, furnished with all kinds of appliances, and no need for them to clean as a housekeeping service would come daily.

The apartment had a dedicated living and dining area, a fully-equipped kitchen, an adjustable private study space, and a complete set of luxury bathing products along with top-tier Bluetooth speakers, redefining the concepts of living, working, and entertainment for its residents.

Additionally, the apartment boasted a first-class gym and an indoor temperature-controlled swimming pool.

The gym was equipped with advanced fitness machines suitable for basic training, strength training, circuit training, or stress relief—the options were plentiful.

The apartment manager could arrange for personal trainers, tailoring fitness plans according to individual needs.

In the gender-segregated indoor swimming pool, residents could fully enjoy the pleasures of both exercise and leisure.

There were also exclusive saunas and steaming rooms for relaxation, providing a rare sense of freedom.

Most importantly, the apartment was in the same building as the company. They could simply take the elevator to reach the office.

Ivy had just mentioned planning to sign them to a five-year contract, which meant they could live in this luxurious apartment for five years!

“It’s worth it!” June exclaimed in genuine amazement as she stood in the apartment.

She truly believed now that Ivy intended to create a top-tier pop girl group.

Just the living arrangements alone were this good; it was clear that Star Entertainment had substantial resources to invest in their artists.

“Wow, this apartment is bigger than my previous company’s! Stellar was only 300 square meters,” Megan remarked.

June sighed, recalling that her previous agency, Pinewood, had only 200 square meters.

However, there was a price difference between New York and Portland; the monthly rent for those smaller entertainment companies in New York was likely comparable to this serviced apartment's rent.

After settling in, Ivy began discussing the contract details with June and Megan. 

She pulled out two pre-prepared contracts for them to review, encouraging them to voice any concerns.

In the contract, Ivy was both the owner (Party A) and the manager.

In today's entertainment industry, when an artist isn't yet famous, the company invests a lot in training and packaging them. Initially, these costs are generally borne by the company, but as artists start earning money, a significant portion goes to the company—this is quite standard.

Thus, artist income is typically split into 60% for the company, 20% for the manager, and 20% for the artist.

However, since Ivy is both the president of Star Entertainment and the manager of the girl group, the split between her and the artists would be 80% for the artists and 20% for the company.

If the artists' fame increased and they earned more for the company, Star Entertainment could later adjust the split to 70% or 60% for the artists; they could discuss that later.

Star Entertainment would provide free accommodation and meals for its artists and also cover health insurance and a housing fund.

During the initial period when the company is training and packaging artists, they might not earn any income, so the company would provide a monthly salary of $400 until the artists secured work and began to earn.

Lastly, the artists must strictly adhere to the rules and regulations established by the company.

After reviewing the contract details, June and Megan had no objections.

Although the $30,000 termination fee was somewhat steep, they were quite satisfied with the five-year term.

Five years isn’t too long or too short, especially compared to those companies that sign new artists for eight, ten, or even twenty years.

After pondering for a moment, both June and Megan decided to sign the contract.

“Wait! Don’t you think you should inform your parents?” Ivy suddenly interjected.

Even though June and Megan were both of legal age and could take responsibility for their own decisions, Ivy felt it was still important for them to inform their closest family.

“No need to inform them. My parents have always supported my dream,” Megan replied, signing the contract immediately.

June hesitated after hearing Ivy’s words.

“My parents don’t approve of me becoming an idol; only my sister has supported me,” June explained, noting that her sister had acted as her guardian when she signed the trainee agreement with her previous agency.

“President Lane, I’m already an adult, and I want to make my own decisions for my life!” June declared, signing the contract as well.

After signing, she felt an immense sense of relief wash over her.

Ivy kept her copy of the contract safe, then suggested to the two, “The group isn’t fully formed yet, and the company doesn’t have much to do in the next few days. You guys could take this time to visit home.”

“I’m not going back.”

“Really?” June and Megan replied simultaneously.

June elaborated, “My parents have never liked me working in this field; there would just be arguments if I went home. President Lane, I want to achieve something before going back.”

“That's fair.” Ivy nodded in understanding. Traditional parents often have a strong aversion to their children entering the entertainment industry.

“President Lane, I want to go back and visit; could you come with me? I’d like to introduce you to my parents,” Megan said, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm, although a bit bashful.

“Well… that’s not possible. I have quite a few things to handle right now,” Ivy replied, feeling slightly tempted. She wanted to visit the countryside and experience the charm of the open fields.

However, she indeed had many tasks ahead—she needed to open a corporate bank account tomorrow and handle various company-related matters afterward.

In two days, she had to return to school for her graduation ceremony and collect her diploma.

In short, she had an endless list of things to do.

Upon hearing this, Megan's excitement dimmed as she shook her head. “Then I won’t go back either.”

After saying that, she pulled out her phone to check the calendar and then looked up to ask, “Can I go home for a visit on July 2nd? It’s a family gathering, and I want to see my family, just going there and back the same day.”

“Sure.” Ivy nodded. Today was June 22nd, so they had barely ten days left.

During this time, she might not even manage to gather enough people for the girl group, so letting the artists take a day off to visit home was no issue.

**[I’m going to release a task now!]**  
**[Today’s daily task is to spend $1,000 within 30 minutes!]**  
**[The weekly task is here again! Spend $2 million within 6 hours!]**

Receiving the task, Ivy immediately recharged her Walmart shopping card with $1,000, completing today’s daily task. Now, this shopping card had accumulated a total of $10,000 in funds.

Next, Ivy stated that she had some urgent matters to attend to, advised June and Megan to rest well in the apartment, and ordered dinner for them before leaving.

What to do with $2 million?

Ivy knew that Star Entertainment would need to produce its own music, so she had to invest in a good set of music production equipment.

When it came to music production gear, foreign brands were undoubtedly superior.

With that thought, Ivy logged onto the largest overseas shopping website and spent $1.27 million on a complete set of top-tier music production equipment.

This included a world-class mixing console worth $370,000.

Along with it, she purchased professional computers, sound cards, monitors, condenser microphones, headphone amplifiers, vocal effect processors, professional headphones for sound engineers, and headphones for singers, totaling $900,000 for the equipment, including the YG Acoustics Sonja XV speakers.

Once the equipment arrived, Star Entertainment would possess a top-notch recording studio worth tens of millions.

With $730,000 left, Ivy pondered for two minutes before deciding to allocate it for advertising.

She split this amount into three batches and contacted advertising representatives from TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram to run ads for casting artists for Star Entertainment.

However, the ad content only required suitable candidates to send their resumes to the company’s email.

After filtering the resumes, only those selected would be invited for interviews.

It seemed she would need to hire administrative staff for the company tomorrow, as she couldn't manage to review all those resumes by herself.

The next morning, when Ivy woke up, her recruitment email was flooded with resumes.

Selecting some candidates with high qualifications and ample experience, she prepared to have them come in for interviews, activating her Insightful Gaze 2.0 to get a read on the character of the interviewees, determining who to keep on board.
