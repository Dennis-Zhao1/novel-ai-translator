**Drunken Girl**

As soon as the afternoon shift began, the supervisors from various departments were called out for a meeting.

An hour later, the supervisors returned with exciting news.

Jessica Adams clapped her hands to get everyone's attention. “Everyone, listen up! Our company has reached a cooperation agreement with the Beacon Mall, and our products will officially be featured in their shopping center in two weeks!”

“Oh my gosh! That's amazing!”

“Our company is awesome!”

The staff from the marketing department were stunned by the news, and Rachel Johnson was so excited that she jumped up from her chair.

Amidst the excitement, some people whispered, “I remember that we had talks with Beacon before, but it didn't go through, did it?”

“Who knows? Maybe they thought ‘Snow Lily’ was impressive enough now.”

Six months ago, their company had considered entering Beacon Mall, but the discussions fell through.

This incident had greatly frustrated the general manager, who felt that their cosmetic brand was being underestimated.

But reality was harsh.

The total construction area of the trade center was vast, accommodating nearly 500 tenants, most of which were renowned international luxury brands.

“Snow Lily,” their cosmetic brand, might have a decent reputation in the States, but compared to the globally acclaimed brands already present in the mall, it was relatively small.

Of course, Beacon Mall, being the first in the country to introduce brand-exclusive retail, had support plans for local niche brands, so it wasn't filled exclusively with high-end luxury brands.

However, “Snow Lily” wasn't a local brand, so it couldn't be included in the support plan.

How did this collaboration come about?

Did Beacon establish a support plan for foreign brands as well?

Or had the headquarters made significant moves to enhance “Snow Lily’s” international influence, making Beacon see its potential?

In any case, to celebrate the partnership between “Snow Lily” and Beacon, the company decided to end the workday early and organize a team dinner.

Ivy Williams rubbed her hands together in delight.

Dinner sounded great!

A free meal without spending a dime! Plus, she could eat some good food!

The only downside was the drinking aspect.

Especially since their company, being a local enterprise, placed great importance on drinking culture.

It seemed she had no choice but to drink today.

Around 3 PM, Ivy arrived at the designated dinner location with her colleagues.

This was Ivy's third company dinner.

The first two had been at casual eateries, but this time the company had chosen a local barbecue joint.

Ivy, who always enjoyed a good meal, was excited to try authentic local cuisine for the first time.

Although it was just lettuce leaves wrapped around grilled pork belly, it looked simple yet tasted divine!

After toasting the general manager with her colleagues, Ivy happily wrapped the meat and devoured it, her taste buds dancing with delight.

As she continued eating, she caught a glimpse of Rachel Johnson sitting not far away.

Since the announcement of the good news in the afternoon, Rachel had been in an unusually hyper state, her face a mix of excitement and pride.

While Ivy was also pleased about the company's success, she didn’t share Rachel's level of enthusiasm.

It seemed that while Rachel might not be the best person, she genuinely loved the company and hoped for its success.

After the dinner, the company planned to continue the celebration by going to karaoke.

Upon hearing this news, Ivy felt a wave of dread wash over her.

Her fear stemmed not only from her off-key singing but also from her introverted nature, which made her detest performing in front of others.

Perhaps her unwillingness was too obvious, as Jessica Adams noticed it immediately.

With a wave of compassion, she allowed Ivy to leave early.

Ivy almost burst into tears of joy, silently praising her senior for being so kind!

After leaving the barbecue restaurant, Ivy received a call from her senior while waiting for the subway.

“Ivy, the general manager left her phone at the barbecue place. If you haven’t boarded the subway yet, could you please go back to get it?” Jessica asked.

“Oh, sure! I’ll go right now,” Ivy quickly replied.

“Great! I’ll send you the karaoke address on text. Call me if you can’t find it later.”

“Alright.”

After hanging up, Ivy retraced her steps back to the barbecue restaurant.

The staff there had been waiting with the phone. They discovered the phone under the table while cleaning the booth and called the company to inform them.

After thanking the staff, Ivy used the map Jessica sent her to navigate to the karaoke location.

She walked for about 20 minutes and arrived at a magnificent building.

Looking at the grand exterior of the karaoke bar, Ivy thought to herself that the company had spent quite a bit this time; booking a room here would probably cost more than the dinner.

Ivy called her senior to let her know she was outside.

A few minutes later, she saw Jessica stumbling out of the karaoke bar, clearly a bit tipsy.

Ivy hurried over to help her.

“I’m fine! Ivy, you can go back!” Jessica waved at Ivy with a smile.

“Senior, let me help you inside. I’ll take you to the room before I leave.” Ivy insisted, concerned.

“Alright, thank you, Ivy!”

Jessica hugged Ivy briefly, then added with a grin, “Let’s go! Just drop me off at the door; don’t come in with me, or you’ll definitely end up singing!”

“Okay.” Ivy replied with a smile.

The two entered the karaoke bar named “Scenery.”

As soon as they stepped inside, the booming music hit Ivy’s ears; the place was lively and crowded.

She had heard the music from outside, but inside it was even louder.

Taking a few more steps, she was met with a dense crowd of people.

Under the dim lights, men and women on the dance floor swayed to the beat, moving their waists and hips wildly.

The air was thick with the smell of smoke and alcohol, making Ivy wrinkle her nose in distaste.

Being here for the first time left her with a bad impression; once she ensured her senior was safely in the room, she planned to leave immediately.

Navigating through the throngs of people, they made their way down a dazzlingly lit corridor.

After several turns, they finally reached the reserved karaoke room.

After bidding her senior goodbye, Ivy suddenly felt the urgent need to use the restroom.

Perhaps it was the two beers she had during dinner.

Desperately needing to relieve herself, Ivy didn’t care about her feelings towards the place anymore.

Following the hallway adorned with colorful lights, she finally spotted the restroom.

Standing at the entrance, Ivy paused for a moment.

Once inside, she realized there were separate facilities for men and women, which were located on either side of a shared four-sink area.

Entering the women’s restroom, Ivy found it spacious and clean, with no unpleasant odor, just a hint of floral fragrance.

She even thought the restroom smelled better than the dance floor outside, which was quite amusing.

After taking care of business, Ivy approached the sink to wash her hands.

The sink area was just as lavish as the karaoke bar's exterior.

Since entering, she hadn’t seen anyone, making it a peaceful retreat.

This was a relief; if she had encountered a man while washing her hands, it would have been awkward.

Just as she thought that, a woman stumbled in.

Through the mirror above the sink, Ivy saw a drunken young woman enter.

The newcomer staggered to the sink next to Ivy and immediately leaned over to vomit.

“Ugh! Ugh!”

“Damn! Earning money is really hard!”

Ivy found herself overwhelmed by the sour stench of the woman’s vomit, prompting her to hurry and wash her hands so she could escape. Yet, she also felt a pang of concern for the woman.

After a moment's hesitation, Ivy turned to ask, “Are you okay?”

The woman rinsed her mouth under the faucet and replied, “Um, I’m fine.”

Seeing that the woman was able to wash away the remnants of her vomit from the sink, Ivy felt reassured that she could manage on her own.

Just as she was about to leave, the woman called out to her.

“Hey, wait a second! Can you help me with something?”

Ivy stopped and turned back. “What do you need help with?”

At that moment, she got a clear look at the woman’s face.

To describe her as beautiful would be an understatement.

She looked quite young, perhaps in her early twenties, so it was fitting for her to call Ivy “sister.”

“I’m a bit tipsy; can you help me get to my karaoke room?”

“Sure, do you remember the way?” Ivy asked.

“Yeah, I remember. Thank you,” the girl smiled sweetly.

“No need to thank me.”

Ivy smiled back, leaning in to support one of the girl’s arms, who then leaned slightly against her.

They walked out of the restroom, heading in the direction the girl indicated.

“Are you here to have fun?” the girl asked.

“No, it’s a company event. We’re singing in a room, but I’m not participating since I can’t sing well. I’ll leave once I make sure everyone’s alright,” Ivy replied as she helped the girl along.

“I thought so! You don’t seem like the type to come here for fun,” the girl laughed.

“I can’t sing either, and I don’t want to be here for fun since I need to earn money. My family depends on me,” she said, her voice dropping a bit at the end, hinting at sadness.

Ivy paused, feeling the weight of the girl’s words.

“How old are you? Are you an adult yet?” she asked, concern etched on her face.

“I’m twenty,” the girl replied with a giggle. “Do I look that young? Actually, I’ve been working for four years!”

“First, I worked in a factory and took on various part-time jobs before becoming a trainee and ending up here,” she said, speaking unclear due to her drunken state.

“Does your family need money urgently?”

Ivy felt a pang of sympathy; the girl’s struggles seemed more intense than her own, despite being an orphan.

Ivy was fortunate to have received help, allowing her to attend university.

This girl, though, despite possibly having family, seemed burdened by her circumstances.

“Yeah, it’s urgent! But it won’t be soon!” The girl smiled brightly, her voice filled with hope for the future.

“When I make it big, you have to support me, okay? Vote for me!”

Ivy didn’t quite understand the girl’s words, thinking it a drunken ramble.

She wondered what kind of people would be in the karaoke room they were headed to.

Should she really take her there?

As Ivy hesitated, the girl announced, “I’m here! Thank you!”

“... No need to thank me,” Ivy replied, but she didn’t let go of the girl’s arm.

“Sister, I’m here.”

The girl tugged at her arm, realizing she couldn’t break free, and repeated herself.

Eventually, Ivy released her grip.

She stood there, staring at the girl who was now at the entrance of the room.

The room looked significantly different from the one reserved by the company.

This door was larger and adorned with more elaborate designs.

Yet, Ivy felt the girl wasn’t standing in front of a karaoke room; it felt more like a gateway to a dark pit.

Suddenly, the door swung open, revealing a sharply dressed middle-aged woman about to step out.

Upon seeing the two standing at the entrance, the woman quickly pulled the girl inside and said anxiously, “Why are you so slow? They’ve been waiting!”

She then glanced at Ivy, still standing at the door, and asked the girl, “Who is she?”

“She’s a kind sister,” the girl replied, then turned to the middle-aged woman, pouting, “I drank too much and couldn’t walk, so she helped me over here. Can I drink a little less this time?”

“What do you mean by ‘drink less’? Do you still want resources?”

The woman shot a glare at the girl, warning her in a hushed tone, “You’d better do whatever Mr. Lewis wants tonight! Do you understand?”

“... I understand,” the girl replied reluctantly.

At that moment, Ivy felt as if she had stumbled upon a scene of coercion, unable to hold back her curiosity.

“Wait, did her family agree to let her work here?” she interjected.

“Uh?” The middle-aged woman looked puzzled.

Then, as if she understood, she replied impatiently, “I am her family. Thank you for bringing her here; you can leave now.”

With that, she began to close the door.

Suddenly, a hand jutted out to block the door from shutting.

It wasn’t Ivy, even though she longed to prevent the girl from entering. She didn’t have the courage nor the standing to do so.

“Mr. Lewis? Looks like Fang Fei has arrived; let’s go in,” the woman said with a smile, addressing the man who had just appeared.

Blocking the door was none other than Mr. Lewis, the very person the middle-aged woman wanted the girl to please.

The woman hadn’t anticipated that Mr. Lewis would be so eager, even following them out here.

It seemed he was quite pleased with Meng Fangfei.

What followed was a rebuke from Mr. Lewis, “Can’t you do your job? You have an artist under you, yet you’re only just bringing her here?”
