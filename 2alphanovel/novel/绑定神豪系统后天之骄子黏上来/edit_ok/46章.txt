**Wealth and Ambition**

Under Stella Smith's encouragement, Melanie regained her confidence.

Afterward, Stella shared the current state of the company with Melanie. Upon learning that Starshine Entertainment had established its base in Portland, Oregon, and that the business license was still pending, Melanie quickly replied, “No worries, I can wait. I believe you'll come to get me soon, Stella.”

At this moment, Melanie had already regarded Stella as her mentor, ready to follow her guidance eagerly.

The atmosphere was light and uplifting. Stella looked at Melanie, whose face was beaming with joy, and couldn’t help but express her thoughts.

“Melanie, you should avoid attending those late-night parties. Our company doesn’t engage in such activities.”

Stella felt a bit awkward; she didn’t want her company to be associated with any underhanded dealings. It was crucial to make the rules clear to Melanie so she understood the company’s culture.

Melanie was taken aback but quickly explained, “I didn’t agree to go to the party with Lily. I spent the entire night working at several venues, performing. I didn’t go—I just…”

She hesitated, not wanting to lose her friend Lily too soon.

Melanie remembered the first time she performed a song; the excitement on Lily’s face and her heartfelt praise still lingered. They had been great friends, both working hard for their common dreams.

But slowly, Lily changed.

Melanie noticed Lily's transformation but didn’t know how to stop it. Lily simply wouldn’t listen to her. All she could do was try to maintain their friendship, hoping it would endure.

However, today she had turned Lily down again. She thought their once strong bond might finally be crumbling.

“...I just find it hard to refuse friends, but I definitely didn’t agree to anything!” Melanie promised.

Stella felt a wave of relief wash over her. “That’s great! Melanie, don’t worry. Starshine Entertainment absolutely does not engage in any shady business! If you’re still unsure, I can write a clause in your contract that prohibits such dealings. We’ll support each other and grow together!”

Stella believed that maintaining one’s principles was valuable. It would allow one to walk proudly, earn respect, and gain trust!

“Okay!” Melanie nodded vigorously. Despite her desire to shine on stage, who wouldn’t want to sign with a company that was all about integrity and fairness, allowing them to truly pursue their ambitions?

“By the way, you mentioned you were working at several bars today. Isn’t that hard on your throat? As a singer, you need to take good care of your vocal cords. Don’t take any more bar jobs until your voice is fully healed.”

Stella advised, softening her tone as she asked, “Are you short on cash? I can lend you some, but just to clarify, this would be an advance on your salary, which you’ll need to pay back once you start earning.”

“No, I’m not short on money!” Melanie quickly shook her head. “My current company pays me well enough. I share a rental and am very frugal with my expenses. It’s enough for me. I work at the bars to let more people hear my music, to see if there’s an audience, and to check if my style is as niche as I think.”

“I see,” Stella replied, understanding the reasoning. “Then please don’t work at the bars for now. Take good care of your voice and just wait for me to come get you.”

“Sure!” Melanie replied, her spirits lifted.

After being let go by her current company, Melanie had faced a significant blow. However, she quickly bounced back and began working at various bars to sing. During this time, she discovered that many people enjoyed her performances.

Several talent agents approached her with offers, but when they heard her cancellation fee, they quickly backed off. Perhaps they thought her niche style wasn’t worth investing in.

Melanie suddenly felt a wave of sadness wash over her. She felt incredibly lucky to be noticed by Stella! 

She had originally thought she would be bound to her current company for another nine years, having signed a ten-year contract. That meant her career had barely lasted a year.

Yet Stella believed that Melanie’s talent was more than sufficient; what she needed now was an excellent stage performance that would leave a mark on the audience.

When Melanie returned to her rental, it was already late. Perhaps she had consumed too much coffee, as Stella lay in bed with wide-open eyes, unable to feel any sleepiness.

Recalling Melanie’s performance at Black Whale Bar still filled her with excitement. Tossing and turning in bed, Stella found herself unable to sleep. She sat up, slightly parted her lips, and mimicked Melanie’s vocal techniques, experimenting with the sounds.

“Oh woo woo woo yeah yeah yeah, la la la, cough cough cough cough cough!”

As she exerted too much effort in her pronunciation, Stella began to cough.

Her cat, Lucky, looked at her with a feline disapproval, causing Stella’s face to flush as she collapsed back onto the bed, pulling the blanket over her head, curling up inside it.

Clearly, imitating a talented singer’s vocal technique was not as easy as it seemed.

Three days off passed, and besides June and Melanie, Stella hadn’t managed to recruit any other promising talents from other companies.

It wasn’t that she hadn’t encountered talented individuals. But those individuals were currently valued by their signed companies and looked down on Stella, who had set up her base in Portland.

Why would they want to move to another area when they could thrive in the capital?

Or perhaps they dismissed Stella as a fraud. No matter how much she explained or guaranteed, they were unwilling to believe her claims.

June and Melanie were genuinely lucky finds for Stella.

That morning, on her way to work, Stella received a message from Manager Lewis at the Portland International Financial Building’s property center.

He sent her several photos of workers diligently renovating and one photo of the newly made company rooftop sign.

Stella expressed satisfaction and replied, “Thank you for your hard work.”

Manager Lewis quickly replied, “Not at all! This is what our property center is here for!”

“Miss Smith, if you have any dissatisfaction with the company’s renovation design or the sign design, please let me know. We will definitely modify it until you are satisfied.”

Stella typed back, “No need. The design draft you sent me the day before yesterday looks great. Just proceed with that version.”

Manager Lewis responded promptly, “I’m glad you’re satisfied! I will supervise the work closely to ensure everything is completed as you requested.”

Stella didn’t reply further. Communicating with Manager Lewis was exhausting; if she replied with “Okay” or “Thank you for your trouble,” he would inevitably send another lengthy response.

Let’s just leave it at that.

Stella forwarded the photos Manager Lewis sent to the group chat that included only her, June, and Melanie. 

Before long, the small group chat buzzed with excitement as they engaged in enthusiastic discussions about the photos.

June and Melanie had only met through Stella’s introduction yesterday when they all had dinner together.

Soon, they would be part of the same group, so getting to know each other’s personalities in advance was a good thing. 

It was a necessary process for any newly formed team—a phase of adjustment that couldn’t be skipped.

When Stella arrived at the company, she began her tedious translation work again.

During the lunch break, she was informed by the logistics department to pick up a parcel.

Stella was puzzled; ever since she moved, she hadn’t filled out her delivery address as her school or the company’s address.

So, she told the logistics staff, “This isn’t my parcel.”

“Really? It’s addressed to you.”

The staff handed the parcel to Stella and pointed out the recipient's name on the delivery slip.

She looked closely and confirmed it was indeed her name.

The sender was Sandy Green.

Stella vaguely remembered that Sandy Green was the jewelry consultant who had assisted her at the Gem Cage a few days ago. She was her VIP customer service representative.

Was this a gift from Gem Cage for VIP clients?

Stella felt a strange sense of foreboding and communicated with Lucky in her mind, “Lucky, can you see what’s inside this?”

【Let me take a look, wow!】

“What is it?” Stella asked mentally.

【It’s a cat-head-shaped piece of jewelry, and it looks just like me! It even has emeralds for eyes!】

No way!

After buying the jewelry, Stella hadn’t returned to Gem Cage for more.

A piece that resembled Lucky so closely must have been custom-made!

Sandy Green couldn’t have seen Lucky!

Who could it be? 

Was it John Carter? Lucas Murray? Or that guy with the surname Johnson?

Stella analyzed the possible culprits in her mind. The only individuals who would go to such lengths would be the determined ones pursuing her fate.

It had to be the one with the surname Johnson; he was the only one who had seen Lucky.

The logistics staff noticed Stella staring blankly at the parcel and reminded her, “This should be your package, right?”

Stella quickly shook her head; she didn’t want to accept this parcel. She replied, “Please return it. I didn’t order anything, and I don’t have any friends or family sending me packages.”

“Alright, I’ll return it,” the staff said.

“Thank you for your help,” Stella replied, feeling a bit embarrassed.

Back at her workstation, Stella felt a mix of emotions for a while. 

So, was this an attempt to win her over with gifts? 

What a lunatic! 

Sending such expensive jewelry so casually!

Stella quickly messaged the jewelry consultant Sandy Green, asking if someone had custom-made jewelry at Gem Cage to send to her.

The response came quickly: “Yes, Miss Smith. Have you received the parcel?”

Upon confirming, Stella’s face fell into a frown as she typed back, “I saw it, but I didn’t accept it. The person who customized the jewelry is my stalker. I don’t want to accept his gifts. After the parcel is returned, please forward it back to him.”

“If he causes you any trouble and asks you to forward it to me, just tell him that if he continues to stalk and watch me for no reason and sends me inexplicable gifts, I will call the police to handle this matter!”

After sending that message, about ten minutes passed before she received a reply: “Understood. I’ll make sure to handle it.”

A few moments later, Sandy Green sent a voice message.

Stella converted the audio to text.

“Miss Smith, I’m truly sorry! When that gentleman came to our store to customize the jewelry, he clearly stated he knew you were our VIP customer and mentioned that you were friends. I took him at his word, believing you two were indeed friends. I had no idea he was your stalker! I didn’t mean to disclose your company address!”

Stella sighed, typing back, “I know you didn’t do it on purpose. That person’s identity is complicated. When you reply to him, try to be tactful. Shift any uncomfortable things onto me; he’ll understand it’s my intent.”

The response came back: “Okay, Miss Smith. I’m truly sorry!”

Stella didn’t reply further.

She felt a bit frustrated, but in the face of these determined ones, avoiding them seemed the only viable option for now.

Thinking of the information she had gathered online about John Carter a while back, Stella groaned to the system, “Lucky, John Carter has a fortune of over 60 billion, while his father has over 300 billion. When will my wealth catch up to his father’s level so I don’t have to keep dodging these determined ones?”

【Don’t worry! I’ll work hard to send you tasks! One day, you will become the richest person on this planet!】

Lucky declared earnestly.

“I’m glad I have you bound to me; otherwise, I wouldn’t even have a chance to rise. Just seeing the word ‘billion’ would make me want to back down.”

Stella felt grateful.

Without Lucky, she would be just an ordinary worker in this vast city, busy her entire life, and might not even earn 5 million.

As an unprivileged orphan with no power, what could she use to compete against those privileged ones?

With that thought, Stella genuinely wanted to give Lucky’s belly a comforting rub.

It seemed that Lucky sensed Stella’s unease and stealthily peeked out from her bag, exposing only its two fluffy ears, twitching as if calling her to come and pet it.

Stella looked around to ensure no one was watching her and promptly reached out her finger to poke Lucky’s furry little ear, whispering mischievously, “Lucky, if you could just let me draw the skill to conceal my luck quickly, all my worries would be solved~”

As soon as she said that, Lucky’s fluffy ears immediately retracted back into the bag, and the whole cat vanished, starting to chant in Stella’s mind.

【Very hard to draw! Very hard to draw! This skill can only be drawn under a highly lucky state of a strong luck person. It’s very difficult!】

“Alright, alright! I got it!” Stella hurriedly interrupted, her head buzzing from Lucky’s noise.

Can’t I just take my time with it?
