Stella Johnson couldn't believe her eyes when she noticed the car tailing her. It wasn't just any car—it was a luxury vehicle, sleek and undoubtedly expensive, gliding silently by her side like a predator sizing up its prey. She wasn’t a car enthusiast, but even she could tell this one was in a league of its own, capable of leaving her in the dust without breaking a sweat.
Breathing heavily, Stella came to a halt, pretending to stretch while secretly glancing at the driver. The man behind the wheel was watching her, his gaze steady and penetrating. A wave of unease swept over her, but she pushed it down, squaring her shoulders.
"What do you want?" she asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside.
The car’s engine purred softly as it rolled to a stop. Ethan Carter stepped out, moving with an easy confidence that only made Stella’s nerves worse. He was tall, dressed casually but impeccably, and carried an air of effortless control. His sharp features softened as his eyes swept over her, taking in her disheveled state. Stella’s cheeks burned—she must have looked a mess after her morning jog, her face flushed and hair sticking to her forehead.
“Relax,” Ethan said, holding up a bottle of chilled water as though it were a peace offering. “You look like you need this.”
Stella flinched, her walls immediately shooting up. “What do you want from me?” she demanded, her tone sharper now.
Ethan hesitated. He’d expected her to be wary, but her outright hostility caught him off guard. Yesterday’s events must still be fresh in her mind—the drunken antics, his overprotective reaction when he overheard someone planning to harm her. While his intentions had been good, he realized now that his approach had been all wrong.
“Here,” he said, softening his voice, “use it on your eyes. You’ve just finished running—it’s not good to drink it cold right away. Wait till it warms up a bit.”
Stella shot him a skeptical look, her fingers twitching as if she might accept the bottle. But after a moment’s hesitation, she turned away, resuming her jog without another word.
Ethan exhaled slowly, watching her retreating figure. Her defenses were higher than he anticipated, but he couldn’t blame her. He had come on too strong, and now he needed to rethink his strategy. With a wry chuckle at his own misfortune, he climbed back into his car and followed her at a respectful distance.
As Stella neared a small grocery store, a sudden sharp pain shot through her calf. She yelped as her leg gave out, sending her sprawling onto the sidewalk. The contents of her bag—shampoo, toothpaste, fresh fruit—spilled out in all directions. Wincing, she struggled to sit up, her hand instinctively reaching for her phone. Thank goodness for the sturdy case; it was one of the few things in her life that hadn’t fallen apart recently.
Frustration bubbled inside her as she took stock of the mess. Why did everything feel like a constant uphill battle? It was as if the universe had decided to test her patience at every turn. She was still brooding when a shadow fell over her.
“Did you hurt yourself?” Ethan’s voice broke through her thoughts, low and steady.
Before she could protest, strong arms lifted her off the ground as though she weighed nothing. Her breath hitched, the world tilting momentarily before she found herself cradled against his chest. His scent—clean, with a hint of something woodsy—washed over her, and for a moment, she forgot to resist.
“Put me down!” she hissed, squirming. “I’m fine!”
But Ethan ignored her protests, his concern evident as he carried her toward his car. Around them, curious onlookers began to gather, their murmurs growing louder.
"Is that a Rolls Royce Ghost?" one student exclaimed, awe-struck. "Incredible! I’ve only seen them online."
“Do you think he’s some kind of big shot?” another chimed in.
“Maybe he’s here for a girlfriend,” someone joked, earning a few snickers.
Others, however, were more empathetic. A boy who had been about to help Stella defended her. “She looked like she needed help, not like she’s trying to scam anyone.”
Meanwhile, Ethan reached the car and carefully placed Stella in the passenger seat. She glared at him, but he remained unfazed.
“We’re going to get you checked out, just to be safe,” he said with a reassuring smile.
“I don’t need to be checked out,” Stella retorted, crossing her arms. “It’s just a cramp.”
But Ethan was already fastening her seatbelt, his calm persistence leaving no room for argument. Stella huffed, sinking back into the plush leather seat as the car pulled away. The murmurs of the onlookers faded into the distance, replaced by the quiet hum of the Rolls Royce’s engine.
Inside the car, the tension was palpable. Stella stared out the window, refusing to meet Ethan’s gaze. He, on the other hand, seemed perfectly at ease, his hands resting lightly on the steering wheel.
“Why are you doing this?” she finally asked, breaking the silence.
Ethan glanced at her, his expression unreadable. “Because I can.”
“That’s not an answer,” she shot back, her frustration mounting.
Ethan sighed, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the wheel. “I overheard some things yesterday. Things about you. And I don’t like seeing people in danger.”
Stella’s brow furrowed. “What are you talking about?”
“You were drunk,” he reminded her. “There were people around who didn’t have your best interests at heart. I stepped in. Maybe I overdid it, but I wasn’t about to let anything happen to you.”
His words hung in the air, and for a moment, Stella didn’t know how to respond. She remembered snippets of the previous night—hazy memories of loud music, bright lights, and a creeping sense of unease. Had Ethan really been looking out for her? Or was this just another act from a man who seemed too good to be true?
As if sensing her doubts, Ethan added, “I don’t expect anything in return. You don’t owe me anything. But I’ll keep helping you, whether you like it or not.”
Stella’s lips parted, but no words came out. For the first time in a long while, she felt a flicker of something unfamiliar—something dangerously close to trust.
The car slowed as they neared the campus health center. Ethan turned to her, his eyes softening. “Let’s just make sure you’re okay. After that, I’ll leave you alone. Deal?”
Stella hesitated, then nodded reluctantly. “Deal.”
Ethan’s smile returned, faint but genuine. As the car came to a stop, he reached over to help her out, his touch gentle and unwavering. Stella felt her resolve waver, but she quickly shoved the feeling aside. She didn’t have time for this—not for mysterious men in luxury cars, not for their cryptic kindness, and certainly not for the growing warmth in her chest.
As they stepped inside the clinic, Stella couldn’t shake the nagging thought: her life had taken a turn she never saw coming. And somehow, she knew this was only the beginning.
