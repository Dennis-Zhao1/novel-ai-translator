**Adaptation:**

Stella Roberts breezed through a day's workload in just an hour, leaving her colleagues at the office stunned by the towering stack of completed documents.

"What's up with Stella today? Did something happen?" one coworker asked, eyebrows raised in curiosity.

"Maybe it's got something to do with that day she went to the police station," another speculated.

"I asked her about it this morning, and she said she's doing fine now," someone else chimed in.

"Of course, she'd say that to us. Who knows how she's really feeling? But I'm more concerned about how fast she's translating. She's bound to make a bunch of mistakes when she reviews them later," another voice noted.

"Yeah, even Mr. Johnson, who usually praises her work, might end up critiquing her," came the response.

Meanwhile, Stella, lost in her zone, was oblivious to the chatter around her. Ever since she acquired a knack for the language, the documents seemed to translate themselves, allowing her to type effortlessly. She felt confident and resolved to tackle more challenging translation work next; the routine of typing from documents every day was getting monotonous.

Oops, pride was sneaking in, wasn’t it? It was always better to stay humble.

Stella had already sent a chunk of her translations to her colleague, Emily Smith, for review. However, Emily's expression was anything but pleased when she received the documents.

"She finished these so quickly? I'm going to have a lot of corrections to make!" Emily thought, frowning. Stella had always been diligent and reliable. How had she changed so much in just two days? If there were too many mistakes, Emily knew she'd have to talk to Stella—she couldn’t let her slack off like this!

With a sense of dissatisfaction, Emily opened the file and began her review. She meticulously searched for translation errors, and before she knew it, she had flipped through three pages of dense text without finding a single mistake. Not only that, but some of the translations were even more polished than she had anticipated, prompting her to double-check their accuracy.

The more she reviewed, the more astonished she became. She spent the entire morning examining the translations Stella had completed in just one hour. By the time she was done, she was utterly shocked.

With the stack of translated documents in hand, Emily rushed over to Stella’s desk. Just as their coworkers were gearing up for the drama, they were taken aback when Emily exclaimed, “Stella, you're incredible! Did you go to some elite translation workshop? How did your skills improve so much?”

“No, I was just a bit lazy before and didn’t put in enough effort. Now I want to take my work seriously,” Stella replied, laughing.

Little did Stella know, her modest response came off to Emily as the confident words of a powerhouse, stirring both admiration and envy. Emily’s tone turned slightly teasing as she said, “You called that lazy? What does that make the rest of us—slackers?”

Stella felt a bit awkward. “I didn’t mean it like that…”

Emily wasn’t looking to argue; she quickly waved her hand. “Okay, I know you didn’t mean anything by it! But I probably won’t be able to review all these translations today.”

“I trust your translation skills, but I really can’t just let you pass without a review,” she sighed. However, she understood that was out of the question—reviewing translations was her job. If Stella made a critical error and Emily, trusting her, failed to review, they would both face the consequences.

But the speed at which Stella was translating was clearly beyond Emily's usual workload, so they would need to talk to their manager, Mr. Johnson, about it.

After hearing about the situation, Mr. Johnson felt even more regretful about Stella leaving the company. But it was clear that the company couldn’t offer the advancement opportunities Stella sought. She wanted growth in translation, not a direct move to the marketing department; her skills didn’t fit there.

Thus, Mr. Johnson had no choice but to let Stella go.

“How about this? Since you, Emily, say Stella’s translations are excellent, your review team will handle her translations until the 15th of next month,” Mr. Johnson instructed.

“Sounds good,” Emily nodded. Their review team had three members, which should be sufficient.

By the time lunch break officially rolled around, the marketing department’s translation team learned about Stella’s impending departure. Initially, they had been a bit annoyed with Stella’s sudden display of translation prowess, but once they found out she would be leaving next month, their irritation evaporated, and they began to chat and laugh with her.

Since Stella would no longer be a competitor within the department, there was no need for hostility; after all, having more friends meant more opportunities. Who knew—when they moved on from this job, they might even seek her help when looking for new positions.

Moreover, everyone had witnessed Stella’s true translation abilities today. The job she found after leaving would likely be even better than her current one, so they needed to handle their relationship with this former colleague carefully and maintain a solid connection.

Faced with her suddenly enthusiastic colleagues, Stella felt a bit overwhelmed. After lunch, she noticed five new contacts added to her phone, which made her friend, Lily Thompson, beside her, a bit envious.

It wasn’t that Lily wanted to add those colleagues; she just couldn’t stand seeing someone like Stella, who should have been unnoticed, suddenly gain popularity among her coworkers.

However, she thought that after some time, those colleagues would be even more enthusiastic in their praise of Stella.

With that in mind, Lily turned her face away, gazing dreamily across the street at the office building through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Chris Adams, oh Chris Adams. Since you’ve reached a collaboration with the company for me, why don’t you just come find me directly?

Just as Stella finished translating a document, she noticed Lily was gazing out the window again, lost in thought. She followed her gaze but found no man with binoculars across the way.

It seemed that the guy had only looked once—he didn’t appear to be some sort of peeping Tom.

*Ding! I'm here to release today’s daily task!* 

The system’s youthful voice echoed in her mind.

“But I’m working right now…” Stella replied, feeling a bit helpless.

*But releasing tasks is my job too…* 

*Today’s daily task is to spend $1,500 within 30 minutes!*

The system mimicked Stella's tone of complaint before eagerly announcing the task.

Stella groaned and stood up from her desk, heading towards the restroom. 

Since she couldn't go shopping during work hours, she might as well do some online shopping instead. 

She couldn’t let the system's free money go to waste.

Now, she just had to think about what she still needed to buy.
