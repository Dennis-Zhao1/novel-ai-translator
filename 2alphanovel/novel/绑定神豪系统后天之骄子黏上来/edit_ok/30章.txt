**Stella's Dilemma**

Stella Lawrence wasn't trying to be difficult; she just needed to keep her secret under wraps. No one could know about the quirky system that had taken the form of a small, cheerful cat. 

The tiny feline jumped around her apartment, purring, "I can come out anytime!"

Watching the cat gleefully hop about, Stella considered getting some cat supplies. If anyone visited, the system could easily pass as a real kitten.

Though the apartment was a rental, Stella had no plans to stay overnight. Her essentials were still back at the dorm, and she needed to move them in before she could truly settle.

Her phone buzzed with notifications—deliveries of snacks she and the system had ordered were ready for pickup at the campus. Stella needed to head over to get them.

Locking up the apartment, Stella hailed a ride to the university. As she neared her old dorm, a crowd caught her attention.

Listening closely, it was clear someone was making a bold confession at the dorm's entrance.

Intrigued, Stella edged closer, curious about who was causing the fuss. Before she could get too near, a familiar voice pierced the air.

“Stella Lawrence! From Class of 2018, Language Department!”

It was Luke Mitchell!

Stella's first instinct was to flee, but Luke's voice boomed again, “I like you! I want to be good friends!”

“If you don't show up today, I'll be here every day until you agree!”

Oh no, Stella thought, feeling her cheeks burn with embarrassment. Luke didn't realize she wasn't in the dorm anymore. He hadn't noticed her standing among the onlookers.

Covering her face with her bag, she glanced up at her old window, surprised to see the lights on.

Did her roommate return?

The crowd was thickening around the entrance, eager to witness the drama unfold.

Stealthily, Stella moved closer, trying to catch a glimpse of Luke. There he was, clutching a massive bouquet of pink roses.

The streetlights caught Luke perfectly, making him look almost princely.

Stella could feel herself blushing furiously, her embarrassment rooting her to the spot. She had been amused at the thought of watching others in such situations but now found herself regretting her curiosity.

She finally understood the pressure of public confessions. If mutual feelings existed, it could be sweet, but otherwise, it was pure torment.

“Wow! That guy's really handsome!”

“Too bad, he's about to be someone else's boyfriend.”

“But he said he wants to be friends? Is this really a love confession?”

“Come on, you don't go all out like this just to be friends. It's definitely a confession!”

The chatter around her was relentless, and Stella felt a headache coming on.

What's Luke thinking?

She'd blocked him on social media and his number, making it clear she wanted nothing to do with him. Why was he still so persistent?

Honestly, why would he be interested in someone as average-looking as her?

Stella compared herself to the women she'd seen Luke with before and couldn't figure out the appeal.

“Stella Lawrence, come out here!”

“Stella, your boyfriend is so handsome!”

“Stella, you should go for it!”

Voices began chanting, urging her to accept Luke's advances. The crowd, caught up in the excitement, chanted louder.

“Stella Lawrence, say yes!”

“Stella Lawrence, say yes!”

“Stella Lawrence, say yes!”

The pressure was almost unbearable, and Stella felt like she might buckle under the weight of the crowd's expectations.

She realized they were just caught up in the spectacle, just like she had been earlier. But now, she felt the full force of public pressure, and it was overwhelming.

She couldn't wait for the dorm supervisor to disperse the crowd; she needed to leave, fast.

“Stella's not in the dorm, stop shouting!”

A girl with short hair leaned out of the fifth-floor window and yelled.

Stella looked up, recognizing her dorm leader, Emily Dawson.

So that's why the lights were on; Emily was back.

Stella felt a flicker of hope. Surely, Luke would take the hint and leave now, right?

But her hope was short-lived.

“I don't believe it!” Luke shouted. 

“Stella's just avoiding me!”

“She even blocked my number! You need to tell her to unblock me!”

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

Some bold girls approached, phones in hand, calling out, “Hey, add me on social media! I'd love to be friends!”

“Me too!” another chimed in.

“I don't want anyone else; I only want Stella!”

Luke's refusal was firm, his eyes locked on the window of room 505.

“I just want to be friends with her; tell her not to be scared!” Luke called to Emily.

“Friends? Who believes that?”

“We don't buy it!”

The crowd erupted into jeers, while Emily, at the window, sighed, clearly frustrated.

Stella really wasn’t in the dorm!

Who was she supposed to call?

Emily remembered she had Stella's contact and quickly snapped a picture of the scene, sending it with a message: “Stella, there's a super handsome guy confessing to you downstairs! Do you know him? When are you coming back?”

Stella felt her phone vibrate and saw Emily's message.

She couldn’t let anyone know she was right there; even if she trusted Emily, her straightforward nature would spill the beans. So, she replied, “I'm living off-campus now, not coming back. I don't know the guy in the picture. Emily, can you get the dorm supervisor to help?”

Emily: “…”

Stella called such a handsome guy a lunatic? She really didn't care about looks!

Honestly, if he hadn't been so tall and striking, she might have gone down to confront him herself!

What was he thinking?

Didn't he realize some girls didn't appreciate this kind of attention?

She had just come off a long trip and was napping when his shouting woke her!

Of course, Stella would avoid him!

She thought he was a lunatic; why wouldn't she avoid him?

Emily shut the window, deciding to find the dorm supervisor.

Seeing Emily close the window and no response forthcoming, Luke continued, “Stella…”

“That’s enough!” 

A voice, rich with frustration, cut through the noise.

Luke turned to see a familiar face approaching.

“Ethan Carter?”

Luke was taken aback; wasn't he the golden boy in his sister's dreams and his parent's perfect son-in-law?

The Carter and Mitchell families were well-known in the city, but Luke had never really hung out with Ethan, who was a year older, and they ran in different circles.

His older brothers, however, seemed to get along with Ethan just fine.

Why was he here, interrupting his confession?

A man's intuition can be quite sharp, especially when they share an interest in the same woman.

As Ethan walked closer, Luke felt a wave of irritation.

The crowd sensed the tension rising between them.

“Just leave; Stella wouldn’t appreciate this kind of public display. You're only making things worse,” Ethan advised, his gaze steady on Luke.

“Stella?” 

Luke let out a bitter laugh, understanding why Ethan's presence grated on him.

“You know Stella? What's your relationship with her?”

Luke moved closer, his posture challenging.

“It’s none of your business; this is between me and her,” Ethan replied coolly, his expression firm.

“Between you and her?” 

Luke laughed, his eyes narrowing at Ethan, his voice dripping with sarcasm, “This isn’t just about you two; it involves me because Stella's business is my business!”

Watching the two, Stella felt her mind reel.

Why was Ethan here?

Did he come for her?

But if so, why hadn't he just texted?

And wait, did Ethan and Luke know each other…?

“Oh my gosh! That other guy is also super handsome!”

“Is he confessing to Stella too?”

“Who exactly is Stella Lawrence? The star of the Language Department?”

“No, she’s a senior, pretty average looking, but she keeps to herself and consistently earns scholarships.”

“Average looking? Why do these top-tier guys like her?”

“Both of them are incredibly handsome and seem perfect—it’s like they’re from another world!”

The chatter about "Heaven's Chosen Ones" sparked a realization in Stella, and she glanced at the two surrounded by the crowd.

Now it all made sense why they were acting this way!
