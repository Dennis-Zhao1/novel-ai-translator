**Fox Using Tiger's Might**

Stella Lane felt a soft spot in her heart touched by Emma's worried messages.

She chuckled and typed back, “Don’t worry, I might leave New York after graduation.”

New York City was teeming with talent. Stella could imagine that there were plenty of prodigies around. So, she definitely had to leave this place.

Surprised by Stella's decision, Emma didn’t send another text but instead sent a voice message: “Huh? Why are you leaving? Are you trying to avoid those two guys?”

It wasn’t just to avoid Chris and Mike; Stella wanted to escape from more than just the city's elite. But she couldn’t confess that to her roommate, so she simply denied, “No, the rent in New York is just too high. I want to go back to my hometown to develop my career.”

“Oh, I see! You scared me! Honestly, those two guys look like they come from prestigious backgrounds. One of them even has an assistant and a bodyguard; it’s pretty intimidating. I was afraid you were leaving just to get away from them!”

Emma laughed, continuing, “Haven’t you seen those movies? The rich and charming CEO falls for an ordinary girl, and when she doesn’t comply, he tries to win her over with a whirlwind of drama!”

“Girl, you can’t escape! Wahahaha!” Emma even improvised a line from a CEO character.

What Emma didn’t know was that, on the other end of the phone, Stella was scared out of her wits by her description, nearly dropping her phone.

Stella steadied herself and typed a reply: “Hahaha! You said it was a movie, so how could that happen in real life? Besides, with my looks, who would want to force me?”

“Stella, I won’t let you belittle yourself like that! What does looks matter? With your charm, you can make two handsome guys compete over you! Compared to you, those so-called ‘heartthrobs’ are nothing! We focus on quality over quantity!” Emma replied passionately.

“You should have seen the girls downstairs watching the showdown between those two guys; they were practically dying of envy! Don’t even get me started; I’m jealous too!”

“I’m sure you have a special charm that attracts handsome guys. I bet your future suitors will be of the same caliber as today!”

“After sharing a dorm with you for four years, I never realized you were this awesome!”

Stella was nearly overwhelmed by the compliments and desperately wanted to change the subject. “Emma, didn’t you just get back to campus this afternoon?”

“Yeah, yeah! My train always arrives around this time. I’ve been on the train all day, I’m exhausted!” Emma replied in a voice message.

“Then you should rest up. We can chat later.” Stella quickly typed back.

“Okay, I’m going to sleep now. Talk to you later!” Emma replied at last.

Stella put down her phone and nervously turned to her little cat beside her, asking, “Buddy, those prodigies won’t be like the ones in the movies, right? There won’t be anyone worse than Mike, right?”

The little cat felt a twinge of worry too. “I don’t know. I thought Mike wouldn’t qualify as a prodigy, but…”

The cat's hesitation made Stella’s heart sink. What if she really encountered someone more terrifying than Mike? What would she do?

After a moment of silence, she rallied her spirits and declared, “Forget it! I can’t hide in a mountain cabin just because of some unknown possibilities! I can’t avoid people forever!”

How would she complete the system’s tasks and acquire skills to secure her future?

She refused to believe that in this lawful society, anyone would dare to use force!

Stella huffed as she lay back on the couch.

Darn it! She really never thought she’d be worried about her safety one day!

The side effects of this overwhelming fortune were truly frustrating!

What kind of strong person was she really?!

With her gloomy thoughts, Stella drifted off to sleep.

The next day, Stella was jolted awake by a nightmare.

In her dream, Chris and Mike were pulling her like a tug-of-war rope, straining in opposite directions.

One shouted, “This fortune is mine!”

“No, I’m the chosen one; this fortune should rightfully be mine!”

Then a spray of blood blossomed, and Stella woke up in a fright.

She knew dreams weren’t real, but this nightmare shattered all the courage she had managed to muster the night before.

Stella glanced at her phone, saw it was still early, and decided to wait a while before calling Sarah to ask for a day off.

She definitely didn’t want to go to work this morning.

Now that she thought about it, it was suspicious how their company could partner with Global Trade Corp.

Chris, the seemingly suave and mature man, had turned into a creepy stalker who followed her to the lingerie store… what a strange man.

Stella tugged at her damp short sleeves; she had woken up in a sweat from that nightmare and needed a shower.

Realizing she had no spare clothes, Stella pulled out her phone and ordered disposable underwear and bathing supplies from an online supermarket, along with breakfast for the day.

She had learned about disposable underwear from Jessica.

As for her outer clothes, the rental had a washer-dryer combo; she could just toss her clothes in to be washed and dried before putting them back on.

---

Jessica had cried herself to sleep the night before.

Seeing her red, swollen eyes in the mirror that morning, she had planned to take a sick day from work.

But thinking about Stella stealing her glory made her grit her teeth in anger.

Determined to confront Stella about why she was so shameless and took credit for her work, Jessica still went to the office.

But what Jessica didn’t expect was that she hadn’t taken a day off, yet that shameless Stella had!

Jessica glared at the empty desk beside her for who knows how long, finally spotting Stella in the afternoon.

“Stella Lane!”

The moment she saw Stella, all her pent-up rage exploded, and Jessica leapt to her feet, shouting.

“What now?”

Startled by Jessica’s furious yell, Stella snapped back, clearly annoyed.

“Stella Lane, you have no shame! You stole my credit!”

Jessica marched up to Stella, scolding her angrily.

“Are you out of your mind? What credit do you think I stole from you?”

Stella scoffed, thinking about Jessica’s translation skills. Even if she didn’t have the skill to specialize in languages, she wouldn’t have taken Jessica’s translations as her own.

What could she have stolen from Jessica?

A wrong translation?

“You still refuse to admit it!”

Jessica raised her hand, pointing at Stella, demanding loudly, “You haven’t forgotten about the TikTok video from yesterday, have you?”

“That was me who discovered it first! I recognized the person in the video was Chris!”

“But after you found out, you immediately turned around and sent the video to Chris, stealing my credit so easily!”

“And what about me? What’s my hard work worth?”

Stella smirked, swatting Jessica’s hand away and looking at the trembling woman in front of her. “Do you really think I care about that lousy credit?”

“Jessica, are you really out of your mind? I’m going to tell Chris that you told me to send him that video!”

“Oh, I almost forgot! When I sent it to him yesterday, I mentioned it was discovered by my colleague. So, did he thank you personally last night?”

Stella coldly retorted.

Seeing Jessica’s furious reaction, Stella could guess what had happened at the dinner party last night.

She remembered her senior mentioning that the dinner had something to do with the collaboration with Global Trade Corp.

Since Chris was able to follow her to the lingerie store, he definitely attended the dinner to see her.

He might have publicly praised her for the video too.

Jessica, realizing she knew Chris and was praised for the video, would be extremely jealous.

But Stella didn’t want that credit at all!

Faced with such a carefully planned approach, Stella felt nothing but terror!

“I’ll make you proud!”

Jessica, enraged, lunged at Stella to hit her.

Stella, however, dodged her attack with ease.

Seeing the situation escalate, the onlookers among their coworkers quickly stepped in to mediate.

Two male colleagues restrained Jessica’s arms to prevent her from reaching Stella.

Stella, escaping from the attack range, looked at the raging Jessica with a sneer.

“Pfft! You shameless woman! He shouldn’t even look at that internet celebrity! You’re just bitter!”

Jessica was beside herself with anger while Stella continued to mock her, “Who says he’s interested in me? Can’t we just be friends?”

“Jessica, does your love-struck brain think of anything besides romance?”

“I’m here to tell you today that I’m on the same level as Chris! I’ve been pretending to be poor to experience life! He’s my friend, so of course, he’d say nice things about me at my workplace!”

“Do you really want to offend me that much? Are you looking to be forced out of New York?”

Jessica was stunned into silence by this revelation, and the surrounding colleagues were equally shocked.

Jessica’s eyes widened in disbelief; she had considered why Stella had Chris’s contact.

But since she couldn’t figure it out, she simply assumed Stella had used some trick to get it.

Now, though, she realized this reasoning was rather flimsy.

Thinking back to the influencer who was rejected from adding Chris on social media and was now trending, she realized Stella was just not that kind of person.

What kind of tricks could a reserved and quiet person like Stella pull to add Chris on social media?

The answer was simple: they were genuinely friends.

Not the kind of sordid relationship Jessica had imagined.

After all, Stella’s looks didn’t even meet that standard; how could they have that kind of relationship?

“Are you really friends?” Jessica asked in disbelief.

“Why would I lie to you? Am I that bored?”

Stella looked at Jessica with disdain.

Yes! She was indeed bored!

She just wanted to mess with this crazy woman!

“You’ve spent four years of university eating the cheapest cafeteria food, wearing the cheapest clothes, and receiving student aid for two consecutive years. Was all that just an act?” Jessica pressed on.

Hearing Jessica say that, Stella almost broke character, struggling to maintain her facade of confidence.

Jessica’s sharp tongue was truly relentless!

“Yes, it was all an act!” Stella shot back defiantly.

If Jessica didn’t believe her, she would take out the 5.55-carat sapphire pendant she kept in her bag and throw it at this crazy woman’s face!

Let her see how ridiculous she was!
