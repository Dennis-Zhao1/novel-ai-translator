**Contract Termination**

In less than half an hour, Paul arrived at the private dining restaurant with the contract and payment machine in tow.

Twenty minutes later, Ethan, the head of the renovation company that Mr. White had contacted, also appeared, carrying his own contract and payment machine.

Following a quick introduction from Mr. White, Stella and Ethan shook hands, officially meeting each other.

The three parties—Stella, Paul, and Ethan—got straight to business.

Stella began by signing the land sublease agreement for the premium car dealership in the tech district of River City with Paul. She planned to pay Paul a total of $2,165,000, which included an additional $340,000 for car purchase costs.

Paul hesitated, wanting to refuse the payment since he had willingly offered Stella a discount of $340,000. “Miss Smith, there's really no need to pay me this amount,” he insisted.

“Come on, Paul, just take the money. This $340,000 more than covers a year’s worth of land lease fees. If you keep refusing, I might think twice about shopping at your dealership next time,” Stella replied with a smile, making it clear she wasn’t trying to take advantage of him.

The idea of this middle-aged man possibly going home upset over losing $340,000 made her feel a bit guilty. After all, money doesn’t just fall from the sky; it’s earned through hard work.

“But…” Paul was torn. Deep down, he did want to accept the money. However, Miss Smith was a top-tier connection that Mr. White had specifically introduced to him—someone others would jump at the chance to meet.

The $340,000 was initially a voluntary discount; asking for it back would seem inappropriate and could also put Mr. White’s reputation on the line.

“Paul, just take it. I have no qualms about the $340,000. Instead of giving me a discount, how about you introduce me to some rare high-end custom cars when I visit your dealership? That way, I’ll be happy with my purchases, and you can still make a profit. It’s a win-win situation for both of us—there’s no sense in letting one party take all the losses,” Stella suggested.

This wasn’t the first time Mr. White had heard Stella make such a proposal. If Paul refused again, it would seem a bit pretentious, so Mr. White chimed in, “Paul, just accept it. Miss Smith wants to be your friend.”

With Mr. White’s encouragement, Paul felt embarrassed to continue refusing and finally agreed, “Alright then, I’ll accept the payment.”

“Miss Smith, from now on, you’ll be our top VIP customer at River City Cars. No one else will surpass your status. I promise to inform you first when we get any new high-end custom cars in stock so you can pick them out first.”

“Thank you, Paul,” Stella replied with a smile, satisfied with the arrangement.

“No need to be so polite, Miss Smith. What I’m doing is nothing compared to the help you’ve given me,” Paul waved his hand, downplaying his efforts.

Following this, Stella shifted the conversation to Ethan, discussing the establishment of a luxurious indoor sports facility linked to the dealership.

“Mr. Ethan, while we’re calling it a sports facility, the main purpose is to create a space for our artists to perform,” Stella explained.

“I want this indoor sports facility to be on par with the premier facility in New York.”

“I know that the land I’m offering is smaller, but I hope the aesthetics and various amenities of ours will surpass it!”

“I’m prepared to allocate a budget of $4,665,000. If that’s not enough, I can add more.”

"That's more than enough! Completely sufficient!” Ethan quickly raised his hand to express his gratitude. Knowing that such a budget was generous, he wouldn’t dare claim it wasn’t enough—doing so would imply he was taking advantage of someone inexperienced.

Besides, this was a big client introduced by Mr. White, who had warned Ethan in a message to treat her with utmost respect.

Understanding that Miss Smith had a deep background, Ethan was determined to complete her project with diligence.

“Miss Smith, do you have any requirements regarding the construction timeline?” Ethan asked.

“I hope it can be done as quickly as possible, ideally within six months,” Stella replied.

“Sure, with the funds you’ve provided, if we work overtime, completing it in three months is definitely possible,” Ethan considered, nodding.

“That would be wonderful,” Stella smiled in response.

With everything settled, Stella and Ethan signed the renovation project agreement.

After both contracts were completed, Stella pulled out her American Express Black Card to claim her reward, swiping it on the payment machines brought by Paul and Ethan.

When Paul saw the black card, his eyes widened in astonishment.

It looked just like the American Express Black Card he had seen online—the one that only a select few in the world possess, reserved for heads of state, billionaires, and social elites!

Witnessing Stella use it to make a purchase left him feeling excited.

A week later, Stella finally received her company’s business license.

This meant her company was now able to post job listings online!

However, since the company was still undergoing renovations, there was no point in hiring staff when they wouldn’t have anywhere to work.

Stella decided it was best to head to New York City first to pay the termination fees for Julie and Megan, sign them on as her employees, and maybe even scout some talent from nearby entertainment companies.

With a light heart, Stella boarded her flight to New York City.

The plane landed at 11:20 AM.

As soon as she disembarked, Stella sent a text message to Julie.

At that moment, Julie was sweating it out in the dance studio at Harmony Entertainment with Kate and others, practicing tirelessly.

Their dance teacher, Tara, was supervising from the side.

At 11:30, Tara turned off the music, clapped her hands, and called for the trainees to take a break and have lunch.

Julie, out of breath, grabbed her towel from the stretching bench, wiping the sweat from her face.

Just then, Tara walked over and patted Julie on the shoulder, praising her, “Julie, your dancing has really improved; it’s like you’ve been infused with new life.”

“Have you encountered some good fortune recently? You’re not in love, are you?”

Hearing her teacher's question, Julie smiled subtly, “No, Tara. I spend all day in the dance studio practicing; when would I have time to date?”

Tara was only joking, well aware of the girl’s daily schedule. Other than eating and sleeping, dancing consumed her life—there was simply no time for romance.

Tara gave Julie’s shoulder another encouraging pat, inviting her, “Let’s go eat.”

“Okay,” Julie nodded in agreement.

Afterward, she bent down to grab her phone from the stretching bench.

Even though she was drenched in sweat, it wouldn’t be appropriate to shower right after dancing.

When a person sweats, their pores open up. Sudden exposure to external stimuli can cause the pores to constrict, which might lead to catching a cold.

It’s best to shower about an hour after exercising, allowing the body to recover somewhat, which is beneficial for health.

Even the timing of drinking water is best arranged about ten minutes after exercising.

So, Julie could only put up with her sweaty state, feeling both hungry and thirsty, while following Tara to find food.

Walking behind Tara, Julie slowly strolled along and opened her phone to check her messages.

During this period, Julie had been keeping up with the renovation progress photos of Star Entertainment that Stella had been posting in their group chat.

Only by seeing those photos did she feel a sense of reality, confirming that she had indeed been recruited by the president of an entertainment company.

However, when Julie saw the new messages in the group, she suddenly felt her current life become surreal and somewhat unreal.

She pinched her face hard, and upon feeling the pain, Julie stood there blankly for a long moment.

It wasn’t until Tara, who had walked ahead, turned around and called for her that Julie snapped back to reality.

Hurrying to catch up with Tara, she looked at her dance teacher, who she had interacted with for two years, feeling an unexpected lump in her throat.

“What’s wrong?”

Tara asked with concern, “Did something happen at home?”

“No, everything’s fine at home.”

Julie hesitated for two seconds and then looked up, her gaze steady as she told Tara, “Tara, I might be leaving Harmony.”

“...Why? Don’t you want to continue pursuing your dream?”

Tara asked, puzzled.

She knew the entertainment industry had been tumultuous lately, and it was no longer as easy for trainees to break through.

The company wasn’t placing much emphasis on capable trainees like Julie, instead focusing resources on pretty faces.

But hadn’t Julie always been tenaciously pursuing her dreams?

Her dancing had improved significantly; how could she suddenly want to give up and leave?

“Tara, I’m not giving up on my dreams. I plan to leave Harmony and join another company.”

Julie explained, then shared the story of how she met Stella Smith.

After hearing this, Tara looked skeptical, “You’re not being scammed, are you?”

“No! I trust Stella!”

Julie replied firmly and then looked at Tara, “Tara, I can’t go eat with you; I have to wait here for Stella.”

“Then I’ll wait with you.”

Tara gently patted Julie’s shoulder, indicating her support.

She still had some concerns about Star Entertainment, doubting whether Stella was genuine.

Even if the contract termination fees were covered, what if Star Entertainment turned out to be another Harmony or even worse?

She needed to thoroughly investigate for her student’s sake.

The two of them arrived at the company’s entrance, and after a short wait, they saw a young woman in casual shorts and a t-shirt getting out of a taxi.

The woman raised her arm and waved when she saw Julie.

Tara looked at the girl running toward them with uncertainty, turning to Julie to confirm, “Is she Stella? She looks so young!”

“Yes!”

Julie nodded happily, unable to resist running toward Stella’s cheerful figure.

“Just wait over there; no need to come over here.”

Stella playfully scolded, her excitement evident. “Let’s go inside to terminate the contract. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time!”

As they passed by Tara, Julie grabbed Stella and introduced her, “Stella, this is Tara.”

“Tara, this is Stella.”

Tara looked at Stella with suspicion, “You’re the president of Star Entertainment, Stella?”

“Indeed! And you must be Tara, right? Julie often mentions you, saying you teach her dance very well and take good care of her!”

At this, Stella glanced at Tara with a hint of regret.

She was quite pretty but probably in her thirties already.

The girl group industry thrived on youth; if Tara were a decade younger, Stella might have considered bringing her into her company as a member of the girl group.

Of course, there was one prerequisite: Tara’s potential score would have to be above nine.

Hearing this, Tara pursed her lips, noticing the closeness between the two. Was Julie really going to switch to another company?

Stella didn’t linger on the conversation with Tara; she was eager to terminate Julie’s contract and pulled the future star toward Harmony Entertainment’s office.

Five minutes later, Stella sat face-to-face with Mia, an agent from Harmony Entertainment, both observing each other across the desk.

Dressed in casual floral shorts and a black t-shirt, the girl before her looked like a recent college graduate.

So this was Julie’s sister, coming to terminate her contract?

It appeared that Julie couldn’t handle the pressure and had decided to abandon her dreams.

Given her looks, even if she debuted, she probably wouldn’t find success, so why continue to struggle in this industry?

“You must be Julie’s sister. If you want to terminate her contract, you’ll need to pay the fees first. Our company’s contract termination process requires payment before signing the termination agreement,” Mia said slowly.

Stella nodded in agreement. She reached into her vintage white leather handbag, pulled out her wallet, and took out a platinum card. “Where’s the payment machine?”

“Just a moment.”

Mia opened her desk drawer, retrieved a payment machine, turned it on, and placed it on the desk.

Stella swiped her card, realizing the single transaction limit was only $50,000, so she swiped three more times.

After seeing the money transfer, Mia immediately took out a file from her drawer, extracted Julie’s contract, and handed it to Stella before turning to prepare the termination agreement.

Once the termination agreement was printed, Mia signed it and placed her seal before pushing the pen and inkpad toward Stella.

Stella looked at Julie, urging her, “Julie, hurry up and sign!”

“Oh, right!”

Julie nodded, took the pen, and with a slight tremble, signed her name on the termination agreement, pressing her seal beside it.

Mission accomplished!

Stella cheered internally, but then heard Mia speak up, “Julie, you’re free now. You can go wherever you want, and the company can’t interfere. But as someone who has been in this industry for a long time, I want to give you a piece of advice: with your current conditions, you won’t make it in this industry. Don’t think about signing with another company; it won’t help! Either you’ll be scammed for training fees, or you’ll find yourself stuck until you willingly pay termination fees to leave the company. Why bother?”

Stella didn’t appreciate Mia’s words and stood up abruptly, raising her voice, “My sister’s future is none of your concern! I will take good care of her!”

“Please don’t be upset. I’m just a straightforward person who likes to speak the truth.”

Mia stood up and acknowledged Stella’s protective nature toward her sister, feeling a mix of respect and pity.

Having a sister who didn’t focus on her studies but was always chasing dreams would undoubtedly cause some headaches for the family, especially after spending $200,000.

After taking a glance at Mia, Stella calmed her anger and smiled slightly, “Speaking of which, I’m quite curious—what makes the entertainment industry so alluring that my sister is so dedicated to it? I’d love to take a tour of the place she’s been for the past two years.”

With that, Stella turned to Mia and asked, “Could you show me around your company? I want to see the talented artists you have. I want to understand where my sister might be lacking. While she may have given up hope, I haven’t. I still believe in her and that she can make a name for herself in the entertainment industry!”

“Wow! What you’re saying is love, but it sounds more like harm!”

Mia exclaimed in genuine surprise and waved her hand. “Alright, come with me. I’ll show you our company’s debut artists so you can see for yourself!”

Stella felt a surge of joy upon hearing this.

That was exactly what she wanted!

She was determined to recruit all the talented artists with scores above nine from Mia’s company!
