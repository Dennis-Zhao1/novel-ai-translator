**Out of Control**

In a cozy apartment, Ivy sat on her couch, browsing the internet on her phone. She was on a mission to find “Feather Jewelry,” but the results weren’t promising.

“Not this, not this either,” she muttered, scrolling with a furrowed brow.

Just then, her friend Emma emerged from the bathroom, her hair still damp from the shower, looking refreshed and curious.

“Ivy, are you still searching?” Emma asked, drying her hair with a towel draped around her neck.

“Yeah,” Ivy replied, her eyes glued to her phone screen.

“Didn’t Emily mention that the girl was all decked out in designer stuff? Maybe the jewelry is from a high-end brand too,” Emma suggested.

“Nope, already checked the usual suspects,” Ivy replied.

“What are you looking for again?” Emma asked, puzzled.

“Feather Jewelry. Why?” Ivy responded, slightly confused.

“Try looking up Peacock Feather Jewelry,” Emma advised.

“Alright… got it!” Ivy exclaimed, excitement creeping into her voice as she tapped her screen.

Emma abandoned her hair-drying routine to join Ivy on the couch, eager to see the results.

“Gem Cage! That’s a super famous jewelry brand!” Emma exclaimed. “Those Peacock Feather Diamond Earrings alone are worth a fortune! And the bracelet in that set is the most expensive—add in the ring and necklace, and you’re talking over a million!”

Ivy’s eyes widened as she read, her tone turning envious. “Jessie really hit the jackpot. How does one get noticed by a top exec just like that?”

Emma’s expression turned envious, too, as she urged, “See what you can find out about Starry Entertainment and what they’re all about.”

Ivy quickly searched, but after a moment, she reported disappointedly, “…Nothing.”

“How is that possible? Even a small company like Bright Arts shows up online. With jewelry worth over a million, how could the company she works for be such a mystery?” Emma expressed disbelief.

Bright Arts was the agency Ivy, Emma, and a few others were signed with. They felt lucky to be chosen, even if they weren’t thrilled with their agency.

At least it wasn’t a scam demanding training fees, and they received a modest salary.

But the company was small, offering limited resources for their careers.

When a major talent show was announced, Bright Arts jumped at the chance, encouraging the trainees to prepare. They were hopeful for a breakthrough.

But then, a sudden announcement from the boss crushed their dreams, like bubbles bursting. Their carefully rehearsed dance routines would never see the spotlight.

Their group had maintained a facade of camaraderie, knowing they’d debut together. Any discord could derail their progress.

Now, with their dreams dashed, Emily had dropped the pretenses and was targeting Jessie.

The dance instructor often praised Jessie for her talent and grace. Initially, the others felt they could catch up with hard work.

But no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t match Jessie, who remained the instructor’s favorite.

The instructor even bluntly stated that in terms of dancing talent, there was an insurmountable gap between Jessie and the rest, one they’d never bridge.

While the instructor's words might have been true, who wouldn’t feel resentment toward Jessie after hearing such things?

The least conventionally attractive member of the group had extraordinary dance talent.

They had consoled themselves that the entertainment industry valued looks and personas; without the looks, talent was futile.

But who could have predicted Jessie would catch the eye of a female exec from an entertainment company, who personally invited her?

From that moment on, they could no longer deceive themselves, secretly mocking Jessie for her looks.

Because in the entertainment world, as long as an artist connects with resources, even an unassuming person could be propelled to fame with the right support.

Moreover, Jessie wasn’t even unassuming.

Ivy had thought if Starry Entertainment was a step up from Bright Arts, she could build a rapport with Jessie, hoping for a leg up.

But this company was completely unknown online!

“Could she be a scammer?” Ivy speculated.

“What would she scam Jessie for?” Emma replied, puzzled. “If she were scamming, shouldn’t it be someone more… glamorous?”

If the woman’s intention was to scam for fees, she had also promised to cover Jessie’s termination fee.

Just then, the door rattled as Jessie returned.

Ivy and Emma sprang up from the couch as two more girls stepped out from their rooms.

Everyone except Emily gathered at the door, waiting for Jessie to enter.

Jessie was startled to see the group huddled at the entrance.

Before she could speak, they pulled her onto the sofa, bombarding her with questions about the woman’s identity, her intentions, and whether she needed rescuing from trouble.

Their feigned concern made Jessie feel queasy.

Jessie saw through their guise; they wanted to see if they could leverage her connection with the exec for their own gain, pretending to care out of “concern.”

Normally, this group barely concealed their delight at her setbacks, so why would she believe their sudden interest?

Seeing Jessie silent, the two girls who had joined the group assumed she feared they’d snatch her opportunity. One of them softened her tone, pleading, “Jessie, please don’t be like this. We’ve been through so much together. If you have a good opportunity, please help me out. I really need a chance.”

“Yeah, Jessie, we really need a break! Emily’s been giving you a hard time because the company favors her. We didn’t want to get involved and become targets too. I’ve realized my mistakes now!”

Jessie remained silent, her expression unreadable.

As the two girls prepared to continue their flattery, Ivy interjected with a scoff, “Why are you begging her? Can’t you see? That woman is a scammer! There’s no Starry Entertainment online.”

Ivy had searched every possible spelling and variation of “Starry,” but found nothing related to an entertainment company.

Jessie still said nothing. She stood from the couch, pushed past the girls, and headed straight to her room.

“Bang!” The sound of her door slamming shut made the other two girls rush to Ivy, asking, “Ivy, is what you said true? There really is no company named Starry Entertainment?”

“None! I’m guessing her designer clothes are probably knock-offs, and she’s just putting on a show,” Ivy said with a mocking tone, crossing her arms as she looked at Jessie’s closed door.

“Really? Even worse than our current company? Then I got my hopes up for nothing…”

The other girls deflated, their slippers shuffling as they retreated to their rooms.

Emma approached Ivy, expressing concern, “Ivy, don’t be like that. What if it’s real? If you offend her and she doesn’t help us later, what will we do?”

Ivy waved her hand dismissively. “Come on, look at her! Even if it were true, she wouldn’t let us take advantage of her.”

“Even if she’s lucky enough to debut before us, do you really think her looks will take her far? Honestly, she should just give up on her dream of debuting and become a dance instructor. Didn’t Mr. Taylor always praise her dancing skills?”

After her sarcastic remark, Ivy returned to her room, leaving Emma alone on the sofa, looking troubled.

Yes, Jessie dances beautifully; even if she doesn’t debut, she can make a living teaching others.

But what about them?

Among the five of them, only Emily had decent looks, but even those weren’t outstanding in the entertainment world.

If there were any exceptionally pretty faces among the trainees, they would’ve been snatched up and turned into actors long ago. What would happen to them if they couldn’t even make it as trainees?

Their singing and dancing skills were average; they had no qualifications to teach, and their grades weren’t great. If they couldn’t be trainees anymore, what on earth would they do?

They could work in retail or serve tables, right?

Or, they could become internet personalities.

Becoming an internet celebrity had no entry barriers; it was a decent option.

But being an internet celebrity wasn’t easy either. Those who became famous often had clear communication skills or unique talents.

Moreover, who would want to settle for being an internet celebrity after experiencing the hustle and bustle of the entertainment industry?

Those internet celebrities were waiting for opportunities, just like them, to push their way into the entertainment world.

Why couldn’t Ivy see that they were the ones with no way out? They had no right to mock Jessie.

Jessie lay quietly on her bed.

In her small room, she could hear even the tiniest sounds from her neighbors, making it impossible not to overhear Ivy’s taunts.

Jessie knew those jabs were meant for her to hear.

If Ms. Ling hadn’t mentioned that Starry Entertainment wasn’t operational yet during their meeting, she might have felt doubtful or anxious upon hearing that.

However, she knew better, so she simply brushed off Ivy’s words.

She had already accepted Ms. Ling’s invitation, and she was promised that once the company was established, she’d be assisted out of her contract with Bright Arts.

A C-POP girl group even more powerful than top-tier K-POP idols!

Just the thought of it made Jessie’s heart race with excitement.

If only Starry Entertainment could launch tomorrow…

Ethan stared at the investigation report on Ms. Ling that his assistant had submitted, feeling increasingly uneasy.

Since sending a message the previous day, he hadn’t received a response, leading him to suspect that Ms. Ling might know he had been following her.

The report he had just received revealed that Ms. Ling’s identity was far more complicated than he had imagined.

How could a girl with no connections suddenly become wealthy overnight?

Her wardrobe and spending habits had skyrocketed.

According to the investigation, Ms. Ling had inherited a fortune from a relative living abroad. 

But when had she met that suddenly emerging relative, and when had she handled the inheritance? His people couldn’t find any trace of it.

Did this mean the rumors coming from “Snow White” Company were true? 

A colleague of Ms. Ling had mentioned that her true identity was that of a rich girl, someone from a similar background as him.

The thought that they might be evenly matched made Ethan momentarily pleased.

That way, his family wouldn’t interfere in his romantic affairs.

Yet, why did he feel more and more anxious?

Even if they came from similar backgrounds, shouldn’t he have uncovered any information?

Or perhaps Ms. Ling’s family background was even more remarkable than the Ethan family’s.

There were indeed prominent American families thriving abroad, many of which were based in the United States.

These conditions seemed to match up.

However, it appeared there was no family with the surname Ling among them.

Could it be from Ms. Ling’s mother’s side of the family?

Regardless, Ethan understood that he shouldn’t continue his investigation any further.

Because Ms. Ling might discover his actions, and he didn’t want her to dislike him.

Even though he hated the feeling of losing control, it was far worse to be hated by the person he cared about.

At least, Ms. Ling hadn’t deleted him from her contacts yet, which meant he still had a chance, right?

That Luke, who didn’t even have Ms. Ling’s contact information, had the audacity to pursue her.

He had heard Luke was no longer interested in partying, and there were even rumors that he wanted to turn over a new leaf and strive for success.

Old Mr. Luke had cried tears of joy, hosting several gatherings, proudly telling friends that his son had finally matured.

Though Ethan didn’t like Luke, especially since they were both after the same woman, he despised the two Luke brothers even more for trying to take advantage of the situation.

Recently, they had frequently invited him out, but Ethan had found excuses to decline.

He could guess their intentions; they wanted him to help deal with Luke, who had suddenly turned over a new leaf.

These two were laughable, truly thinking that Old Mr. Luke had become too old to care.

He wouldn’t help them; in fact, he wanted to assist Luke.

Ethan hoped Luke would engage more with the family business, ideally keeping him too busy to interfere when it came to Ms. Ling.

“Xiaoxing, I’ve found out that your bank account is under investigation,” said Lucky, the cat, munching on a crab leg during a break from its feast.

“Who is it?” Ling Xiaoxing’s heart raced with caution.

Could it be the authorities?

Hadn’t Lucky assured her that the funds it transferred would raise no red flags?

“It’s Ethan, and there’s also someone with the last name Jones—the one who pretended to faint that day,” Lucky replied, licking its paw clean and reassuring Xiaoxing while munching on shrimp, “Xiaoxing, don’t worry about any financial matters. No matter who investigates your account, they won’t find anything wrong, I promise!”
