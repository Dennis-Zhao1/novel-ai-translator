**The First Curse Word in Life**

The man who questioned with a stern voice appeared to be in his mid-twenties, exuding a youthful presence. His thick black hair was slicked back, highlighting a striking and charismatic face.

His eyes, though slightly narrowed, were large and expressive. As he gazed at Stella Carter, there was a clear glint of intoxication in his look, suggesting he'd indulged in more than a few drinks.

“Huh?” Ethan Cooper was taken aback.

An artist? Surely, Ethan couldn’t be referring to the passerby who'd hurried Stella in here, right?

Thinking Ethan was joking, Ethan laughed and replied, “Ethan, you're pulling my leg, aren't you? Stella just stepped out for a moment, and you don't recognize her anymore?”

Ignoring Ethan, Ethan reached out and took hold of Stella Carter's wrist, who was standing at the entrance.

“Ah!”

The sudden move startled Stella, and she let out a sharp scream, trying to pull away from the man's grip. But his hold was too strong; she couldn't free herself!

Just like that, Stella was pulled into the private room, dragged all the way to the couch by the man. The moment she hit the couch, she immediately tried to stand up and escape, but Ethan wrapped his arm around her shoulders, forcing her to sit beside him.

“What are you doing? Let go of me!”

Stella struggled, twisting and turning, but she couldn't break free from the hold on her shoulders.

“Ethan, you've got it all wrong! She's not with me; she just happened to pass by!” Ethan rushed over to explain, clearly startled by Ethan's actions.

“Huh? No, that's not it…”

Ethan looked at Stella, who was struggling under his arm, and smiled, thinking to himself that Ethan's skills were lacking.

Such a charming girl—any agent with an eye for talent would have signed her immediately. Since no one had signed her yet, he might as well sign her himself!

With that thought, Ethan leaned in closer and gave Stella a quick peck on the cheek.

Stella was so shocked that her voice broke, and she struggled even harder, raising her hand to scratch at this rogue who was trying to kiss her again!

Caught off guard, Ethan was directly slapped on the face.

However, since Stella had just trimmed her nails yesterday, she didn’t break the skin; it only left a long red mark on his cheek.

The sting of pain made him release his grip, and Stella finally broke free from his hold.

“Ethan! Are you okay?”

“Whoa! Ethan got scratched by this girl!”

“Ethan, what were you thinking? How dare you bring someone like this here!”

“Th-That’s really not one of my people! I don’t know her!”

“Ethan, does it hurt? Let me get some ice for you!”

“I’ll go buy medicine!”

“What the heck are you buying medicine for? Call an ambulance right now!”

At that moment, Stella noticed that the private room was filled with people, both men and women, totaling over twenty, with most being male.

These people rushed over to the rogue, fussing over him as if he were on the verge of death.

Suddenly, a young man with slicked-back hair and a pink shiny shirt spotted Stella, who was inching towards the exit, and immediately exploded in anger.

“Darn it! Still trying to escape!”

“You crazy woman! Don't you have any shame?”

He cursed loudly and grabbed a bottle of liquor from the coffee table, hurling it in Stella's direction.

**[Don't be afraid, Ivy! I'll help you!]**

Just as the bottle was about to smash into Stella’s forehead, it suddenly changed course, skimming her face and crashing against the door to the private room.

“Crash!”

The bottle shattered, glass fragments scattering everywhere, mixed with amber liquor that splashed all over Stella.

Strangely enough, the broken glass didn’t harm her at all; she was just soaked in alcohol.

Terrified, Stella hugged her head and began to cry.

Seeing that he had missed, the man in the pink shirt grabbed another bottle of liquor, intent on trying again.

“Crash!”

“Bang!” The bottle fell from his hands.

This time, before he could throw it, he was hit on the head by a bottle thrown from behind him, knocking him down and causing him to drop the bottle onto the carpeted floor.

Dazed from the impact, the man in the pink shirt initially thought his companion was trying to imitate him but missed and hit their own teammate instead. He clutched his head and yelled, “Darn it! Throw it more accurately!”

“Crash!”

Just as he finished shouting, another bottle struck his head.

This time, he was seriously injured and fell to his knees, covering the back of his head with his hands.

He wanted to know who was so stupid to throw bottles at their own team.

But just as he turned around, he was met with the sole of a custom leather shoe, which knocked him flat.

It didn’t stop there; the man continued to receive relentless kicks.

He couldn’t believe it; the person who had hit him with two bottles and was now kicking him was none other than Ethan Cooper, the very guy he had been trying to please!

“Who the heck told you to touch her!”

“Mind your own darn business! You think you're so impressive?”

Ethan yelled as he kicked the man in the pink shirt savagely.

Someone tried to intervene, but they suffered the same fate as the man in the pink shirt, knocked down by a well-placed kick.

The people who knew Ethan were too scared to step in, fearing they would be next.

As a result, everyone stood there, dumbfounded, watching Ethan unleash his fury, the atmosphere turning both bizarre and comical.

It was comical because the underlings who wanted to support their boss were now being beaten down by him.

It was bizarre because Ethan was attacking his own people all because of a woman he had just met, who had also been hit by him!

What kind of stunning beauty could have driven Ethan to act this way?

With that thought, some people turned to look at Stella.

Wow! They thought she must be incredibly beautiful!

But it turned out she was just an average-looking passerby!

Now she was squatting at the entrance, crying as she watched the chaos unfold.

She didn’t look particularly pretty to begin with, and now that she was crying, she looked even worse!

“Looks like Ethan has had quite a bit to drink. Once he sobers up, he should return to normal.”

Someone whispered to another person nearby, then asked, “Did we call the ambulance?”

“Called it a while ago,” came the reply.

“Good, we can send Brother Mike and Ethan to the hospital together.”

Brother Mike was the man in the pink shirt who was currently being ruthlessly kicked by Ethan, lying on the ground motionless, unsure of his fate.

But today, even if Ethan had truly hurt someone, with his powerful background, he could easily find a scapegoat to smooth things over.

So even if someone had a decent relationship with Brother Mike and was worried about his safety, they didn’t dare to step forward.

They were afraid that if they intervened, they might end up in the same boat.

Stella, in tears, was in complete shock at the scene unfolding before her.

Oh my god!

This man seemed utterly unafraid of having blood on his hands!

The people around her merely watched coldly, with no one daring to step in and stop him!

She could almost foresee her own tragic fate.

Thinking that she might die soon, a surge of courage welled up within Stella amidst her despair.

Taking advantage of the distraction, she quietly sent a text message to the police for help.

After alerting the authorities, she planned to escape.

She tried to muster the strength to get up, but her legs felt weak, and she couldn’t stand.

The exit was right beside her, yet she felt utterly helpless.

Determined, she pinched her thigh hard, but it didn’t help; instead, she reached down and grabbed a shard of glass from the broken bottle on the floor.

If the police were late, she would rather take down one of the attackers with her!

It seemed that Ethan had tired himself out; he paused his kicks, tugging at the buttons of his shirt as he caught his breath.

Even though he was furious, he knew to be careful.

On the surface, he kicked hard, but he made sure not to knock anyone out completely.

He figured that Brother Mike would lie in the hospital for about half a year, and then he would be fine.

He had done this to many people before and had experience.

He knew how to hurt without killing.

Ethan brushed his hair back and walked over to Stella, crouching down beside her.

He reached out to touch her face, wanting to check if she had been hurt anywhere.

He remembered that although she hadn’t been hit by the bottle, he couldn’t be sure if she had been affected by the shattered glass.

Even if she had been hurt, he could find someone to fix her face; he wasn’t worried about her cute face being scarred.

Just after he had finished beating someone, Ethan was slightly sweating, exuding a sexy and alluring charm.

As he carefully examined the woman’s face, everyone present felt the weight Stella held in his heart.

However, Stella herself felt differently.

Seeing the bruise he had received from her scratching him and recalling how he had just beaten someone, Stella realized that the man before her was simply a beautifully dressed beast!

Thinking she was about to be hit, she swung her hand down to bat away Ethan’s reaching hand, and she shouted her first curse word in life:

“You piece of trash!”

Ethan was taken aback.

Why was she cursing at him?

“I’ve already called the police! Just wait to go to jail!”

Stella instinctively understood she shouldn’t provoke a criminal, but the man’s approach filled her with anger and fear, making her words spill out uncontrollably.

What began as a romantic drama suddenly shifted to a legal segment.

As if on cue, a knock came at the door of the private room—the police had arrived.

……

After finishing her statement at the police station, Stella returned to her dormitory, tear-streaked and shaken.

The first thing she did upon entering her room was to reassure her roommate.

The arrival of the police had caused a stir throughout the KTV, and as Stella and Ethan’s group were escorted out of the room, they were seen by company colleagues who had come to watch the commotion.

Thus, while in the police car, Stella received a call from her roommate.

Listening to her roommate's concerned voice on the line, the tension that had been holding Stella together snapped, and she broke down in tears, recounting her harrowing experience.

Given the background of the police car, anyone who didn’t know would think Stella had committed some grave mistake and was confessing her sins to a family member.

Upon hearing about Stella’s ordeal and the mention of a possible death, Rachel was extremely worried, regretting her decision to have Stella come over to fetch her phone.

This girl must be terrified!

Initially, Rachel had wanted to follow Stella to the police station, but Stella insisted she not come, so she reluctantly stayed behind.

When she received another call and heard Stella say everything was fine, Rachel finally felt relieved.

Stella truly needed a familiar voice of comfort, but when she saw the police entering the room and calling out “Ethan” as if they were old friends and even chatting with him, her heart sank.

This piece of trash seemed to have a significant background; why would she drag her roommate into this?

Fortunately, things didn’t turn out as badly as she had imagined; nobody was dead, and the man in the pink shirt was still alive.

As she left the police station and headed back to campus, Stella didn’t face any immediate retribution.

What puzzled her the most was that in the station, Ethan was able to contact the family of the man in the pink shirt, easily obtaining their forgiveness.

The parents of the man in the pink shirt even rushed to the police station, wanting to bail him out.

Their son was currently lying in the hospital!

Stella, who had nearly been killed by the man in the pink shirt, couldn’t decide whether to feel satisfaction or pity for him.

In any case, she developed a deep-seated fear of the power behind that piece of trash.

Even though she had returned to campus safely today, Stella was still anxious.

Who knew if that piece of trash would seek revenge on her in the future!

With his capabilities, it should be easy for him to find out her address…

Lying on her dormitory bed, Stella felt like crying again, desperate enough for the system to appear and use its little paws to dry her tears.

After crying for a while, Stella resolved to resign as soon as possible and leave the city right after graduation.

She hoped that the bastard Ethan wouldn’t cause her any trouble before she graduated; she still wanted to earn her diploma!

“Ivy, don’t worry! I’ll help you!”

The system continued to assure her, “From now on, I will give you more money. Anyone who dares to bully you, just throw money at them!”

“Thank you,” Stella murmured, her eyes still filled with tears.

Given what she had witnessed tonight, Stella could guess that the piece of trash came from a wealthy family.

The tasks’ funds released by the Celestial Fortune System were likely insignificant to that scoundrel.

Throwing money at someone? Would she have to throw a bag full of coins at him?

But Stella understood that the system was just trying to comfort her. Even today, the bottle that almost hit her had been moved aside by the system, and she was grateful for that.

Rather than throwing money at someone, she preferred that the system could help her like it had today, lending a hand in times of crisis.

In this way, if retribution came her way, she would have the confidence to face it.

With her worries about the future weighing heavily on her mind, Stella furrowed her brows and fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, she woke up around noon.

It was the weekend, so she didn’t have to work.

Stella planned to wait until Monday to bring up her resignation.

This was the first time Stella was awakened by the system.

“You can’t sleep any longer! Get up and accept today’s daily task!”

“Spend $10 within 10 minutes!”

Stella was taken aback; today’s task money was ten times more than yesterday’s. Would it be $100 tomorrow?

“Ding! Random task triggered, spend $1,000 within 30 minutes!”

Stella was shocked—how did two tasks appear all of a sudden?

What was even more surprising was that this time, the random task's funds had also increased tenfold compared to the last time!
