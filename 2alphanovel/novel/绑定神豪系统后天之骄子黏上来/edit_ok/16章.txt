**Title: Charmed by the Ordinary?**

Ethan glanced at the dishes in front of Ivy Smith. After confirming they were just hearty meals meant to restore energy, he let out a sigh and began to eat.

The food was surprisingly tasty, but as Ethan thought about its supposed benefits, he found his appetite waning.

By the time Ivy had cleaned her plate, Ethan was still toying with his half-eaten stew, lazily stirring the remnants before setting his fork down with a shrug.

*“He's so wasteful! If it were me, I’d clean the plate!”* the Celestial Fortune System grumbled to Ivy.

Ivy silently agreed, but she figured it wasn’t her business if he didn’t finish his meal.

Later, Ethan gathered the utensils and placed them neatly in a paper bag before stepping out of the hospital room, handing the bag to Liam Brown, who was waiting outside.

Liam noticed Ethan seemed a bit off, but he had more pressing questions.

“Ethan, is that really your sister-in-law in there?” he asked, still in disbelief.

He had been lurking outside the door, hoping to catch snippets of their conversation, but the room was soundproof. All he caught was a brief glimpse of the woman inside—nothing like he expected.

“Yeah, that’s right,” Ethan replied, a hint of warmth in his voice as he spoke of Ivy.

Liam’s eyes widened. “Is she someone famous?”

“Not at all,” Ethan replied with a chuckle, dismissing the idea. “She’s a top student at Georgetown University.”

That was about all Ethan knew about Ivy for now. He figured he’d learn more in due time, once things became official between them.

Liam was baffled. This wasn’t the glamorous actress he’d imagined. But when did Ethan meet her? He hadn’t seen any signs!

“Your sister-in-law is quite accomplished,” Liam said with genuine admiration. “How did you two meet?”

“Why all the questions? Writing a biography?” Ethan teased, then softened, “We met yesterday. It was kind of... love at first sight.”

Liam was taken aback by Ethan’s lovestruck tone. “Do you need anything else from me?”

“Just take out the trash for me, will you?” Ethan said with a small smile.

“Sure thing. Anything else?”

“Nope, that’s all for now.” Ethan pondered briefly before deciding.

Ethan initially thought about asking Liam to get some fresh fruit for Ivy, as her medical report recommended more vitamins. But then he realized he could just order some online.

As Liam left the hospital, slightly dazed, he decided to call his buddy Jake, who was with him at the club last night.

“Jake, what happened last night at the club? Did you know Ethan’s got a thing for someone now?”

He fired off questions as soon as Jake picked up.

“Didn’t I tell you everything last night?” Jake replied groggily. “I thought he liked that actress, Megan Foster!”

Jake had been trying to catch some sleep when the call woke him.

“No way! Ethan’s into a college student, and she’s not even someone you’d notice in a crowd!” Liam shot back.

“She’s really just... ordinary. Now he’s calling her my future sister-in-law!”

Jake was floored.

“Wait, is this college student about five-foot-three, plain, with her hair in a simple ponytail?” Jake asked as if something clicked.

“Not sure about her height, but she had her hair down when I saw her. She’s definitely plain-looking,” Liam replied.

“What the heck! Ethan took her to bed?” Jake exclaimed.

“Bed! It was a hospital bed!” Liam clarified, shouting over the phone to clear up Jake’s misunderstanding.

“Hospital play?” Jake was even more stunned. “Did Ethan get into a fight?”

“No way!” Liam quickly dismissed. “Ethan’s the type to treat women with care!”

Jake was left reeling. So Ethan hadn’t accidentally mistaken someone for Megan last night in a drunken haze. He genuinely liked this ordinary girl!

A whole day had passed, and Ethan was still clear-headed and sure of his feelings?

Jake struggled to comprehend Ethan’s attraction to someone so unassuming.

Liam, sensing Jake's confusion, asked, “Don’t you find this all a bit strange? Do you think Ethan’s been... enchanted or something?”

“Come on, enchanted people don’t have bad taste! Maybe he’s been cursed!” Jake suggested sarcastically.

The conversation continued, with Jake recounting the previous night’s events, but they couldn’t make sense of it.

When Liam returned home, his dazed expression was noticed by his girlfriend, Zoe.

She approached, feigning concern, “What’s wrong? Did Ethan chew you out for something?”

“Not at all! I’ve never messed up at work! He just introduced me to a ‘sister-in-law,’” Liam said, still bewildered.

“Really?” Zoe’s voice rose in surprise, a flicker of jealousy in her eyes.

Liam didn’t have an older brother, so this could only mean Ethan had a new love interest!

Zoe, feeling a mix of envy and curiosity, asked, “Who is she? Is it Megan Foster?”

Liam hesitated, and Zoe, growing impatient, coaxed the story out of him, eager to understand this new development.

After hearing Liam’s account, Zoe realized that Megan wasn’t Ethan’s new flame. No wonder her friend had reacted that way to her message!

But this new woman, who seemed so ordinary, had managed to win Ethan’s heart.

Liam mentioned how plain she looked, which didn’t match Ethan’s usual taste.

Not only Liam and Jake, but even Zoe felt there was something strange about all this.

After pondering, Zoe leaned closer to Liam and suggested, “You know how some people in our circles use strange methods to get ahead?”

“I’ve heard rumors,” Liam admitted, wrapping an arm around Zoe.

“Do you think she’s got some connections?” Zoe pressed.

“I thought about it, but it doesn’t quite fit,” Liam replied. He recalled how Jake mentioned Ethan had been scratched by this woman.

Ethan had a bruise, but Liam hadn’t brought it up out of respect.

If she were using tricks to get close to Ethan, why would she cause such a scene? Wouldn’t it be easier to just get along?

“But I heard that to influence someone, some people claim to use mystical charms. Maybe that scratch was part of it?” Zoe suggested.

“But Ethan kissed her first,” Liam said cautiously, considering the implications.

“That charm might have already worked, and she’s just pretending to be innocent!” Zoe argued persuasively.

“That’s possible, I guess,” Liam replied uncertainly, meeting Zoe’s gaze.

“Listen, you should warn Ethan just in case. If she’s up to something, he needs to be aware. I can ask around to see if anyone knows more about this woman,” Zoe proposed.

Liam thought it over and nodded in agreement. “You’re right; it’s better to be safe.”

Meanwhile, Ivy was blissfully unaware that some thought she was using supernatural means to get close to Ethan.

She was munching on an apple, chatting casually with Ethan, who had just learned her name. Ethan was scrolling through her social media, playfully accusing her of blocking him from seeing her posts.

With a bite of banana, Ivy explained, “Nope, I just don’t post much.”

Ethan recalled he had added her on social media using her phone earlier and noticed she hadn’t restricted his view.

“Why not?” Ethan asked curiously, wondering if she had another account.

“There’s nothing worth posting,” Ivy replied honestly.

Her life was pretty routine—studies and work. Not many exciting things happened, and she didn’t want to burden her only friend with negativity.

Although she never posted, she enjoyed browsing her friends’ updates, finding comfort in their happiness.

Ethan was momentarily speechless.

Through their brief interaction, he realized they had completely different lifestyles.

He, for instance, posted multiple times a day—not because he loved it, but because his life was filled with interesting moments.

Thinking about these, Ethan suddenly panicked and opened his profile to delete old posts.

All those photos and videos of him with celebrities and wild nights out with friends—they had to go!

Those fun stories had become embarrassing tales of his past!

As he deleted, a sense of urgency washed over him, hoping to erase everything before Ivy could see them!

After the purge, his profile was nearly empty.

Ethan took a deep breath, feeling as though he’d just dodged a bullet.

From now on, he vowed to be a new man—someone Ivy could respect.

Seeing Ethan engrossed in his phone, Ivy assumed he was busy and said, “If you’ve got things to do, feel free. I’ll be just fine.”

“No, I’m not busy! I’d like to stay,” Ethan said earnestly.

Ivy felt a mix of relief and awkwardness; she didn’t actually need his company.

Ethan should check on the friend he brought to the hospital last night—he was the one who needed support!

The situation was becoming increasingly uncomfortable for her.

*“Hey Ivy, I have an idea to make him leave!”* the system chimed in.

“What’s your idea?” Ivy asked, curious.

*“Just fall asleep!”*

Before she knew it, Ivy felt her eyelids grow heavy, and she drifted off to sleep.

Having tidied up his online presence, Ethan initially wanted to keep chatting to learn more about Ivy. But then he noticed she had fallen asleep.

Ethan quietly approached her bedside, feeling her forehead gently and checking her breathing.

Satisfied she was just resting, he pulled his chair closer and sat down, watching her sleep, unaware of the little system observing him.

*“Why isn’t he leaving? Ivy’s asleep!”* the system grumbled, only to see Ethan lean down and plant a gentle kiss on Ivy’s forehead.

*“You sly dog!”* the system fumed, but Ivy slept on, and Ethan blushed, oblivious to its protests.

The system thought Ethan would just steal a kiss and leave.

But, to its shock, Ethan pulled out his phone and started taking pictures of Ivy’s peaceful face!

*“How dare you! Just wait until Ivy wakes up!”* the system fumed.

It was kicking itself for suggesting such a foolish idea that let Ethan get away with his cheeky antics!

It simply couldn’t understand how Ethan fit the mold of the so-called “Heaven’s Chosen Ones.”
