**Insightful Eyes**

"Thanks for stopping by! See you next time!" 

The fashion consultant, Emily Smith, waved as Ivy Sterling exited the store with a smile.

Ivy stepped out of the LV boutique, balancing several large bags. Though she enjoyed her shopping spree, she had smartly combined her purchases into a few manageable bags. As she slid into a cab, she noticed Emily giving a friendly wave from inside the store. Ivy grinned and waved back, appreciating Emily's exceptional service. Perhaps when her finances allowed for another indulgence, she'd return here before anywhere else.

Once home, Ivy opened her laptop to check her fortune app, an unusual system that rewarded her with gifts and cash. The wheel spun wildly before landing on a cash prize—one million dollars. Ivy stared at the screen, wide-eyed. That was ten times more than her first reward from the system.

Earlier, Ivy had wondered if she'd ever have enough to start her own entertainment company. And now, the universe had seemingly nodded in agreement.

She glanced at the ruby ring on her pinky finger, a previous reward from the system. It wasn't immortality she sought—though the thought amused her—but rather the means to keep her luck under wraps. She chuckled at the idea.

The next day, Ivy donned the fourth LV outfit recommended by Emily for her commute to work. Her vibrant ensemble drew whispers from colleagues, some of whom now seemed eager to befriend her. Yet, it was Natalie Parker, a colleague she'd known for less than a week, with whom she felt the strongest connection. Natalie often regaled Ivy with tales from the entertainment world—a realm Ivy was only beginning to explore.

"What exactly is a 'fan club'?" Ivy asked during one of their conversations, unfamiliar with the concept.

Natalie explained, "It's a group where fans unite to support their favorite celebrities, often capturing their moments with high-tech cameras and organizing events."

Natalie then shared her own story: "I first got into it with a girl group called Radiance. I was a fan of the leader until a new member, Sophie Yuan, joined. I even traveled to see her perform live."

"I taught myself photography and video editing just to promote Sophie online. As she gained fame, more fans wanted her back home, but as her popularity soared, my admiration waned."

Natalie paused, visibly upset. Ivy had heard the story before and understood the emotional investment Natalie had made.

"I watched her latest show last week," Natalie continued, "and it was dreadful. Her acting was off, her makeup was terrible. It felt like she was a different person."

Ivy nodded, comprehending the effort Natalie had poured into supporting Sophie. If she ever started her own company, she'd ensure her artists stayed true to their fans.

Two days passed, and Ivy still hadn't solved her staffing dilemma for the potential entertainment company she dreamed of. Today was June 8th, marking two weeks with the fortune app, and it was time for new tasks.

[Ding! Ding! Here are your tasks!]

[Spend $10,000 in 30 minutes!]

[Spend $500,000 in 2 hours!]

"$500,000?" Ivy exclaimed, nearly dropping her phone. What could she possibly buy to spend that much so quickly?

Jewelry seemed the obvious choice. Ivy headed to the Jewel Cage, a store she often admired for its stunning displays.

"Welcome to Jewel Cage!" said Sarah, a consultant who quickly approached Ivy, noting her elegant attire.

Ivy's eyes fell on a central display featuring a diamond and pearl necklace that took her breath away. However, its $9.5 million tag was far beyond her means.

"Do you have anything under $500,000?" Ivy asked, turning to Sarah.

Sarah beamed, sensing Ivy's potential as a customer. "Absolutely! Would you prefer a single piece or a set?"

Ivy thought for a moment. A set sounded more practical if she wanted to wear it without worry. "A set, please. Let's keep it under $500,000."

Sarah soon presented a jewelry set themed around peacock feathers. "This includes a necklace, ring, earrings, and bracelet, totaling $107,650."

Impressed by the craftsmanship, Ivy decided to buy it. After making the purchase, Sarah showed her a second set featuring water droplet designs, priced at $84,500. Ivy loved the teardrop-shaped earrings.

The third set was an owl-themed collection, priced at $90,850. Ivy was particularly drawn to the whimsical owl designs, reminiscent of her own fortune cat charm. She decided to purchase this set as well, bringing her total to just over $500,000.

Feeling satisfied, Ivy left the store as a new VIP customer, with a collection of complimentary gifts in tow.

"Fortune, how do you think these look on me?" Ivy asked the system, admiring her reflection in a nearby boutique window.

[The necklace is exquisite, but the ring could be more unique!] the system replied with a playful tone.

As Ivy continued her walk home, her phone buzzed with a message. It was from Ethan Carter, a man she had met through a chance encounter. "Ivy, are you free tonight?"

Ivy hesitated. Now that she knew Ethan was drawn to her by her extraordinary luck, she wanted to keep her distance. She had no desire to entertain such connections, especially after her recent experiences.

She decided to ignore the message, hoping time and distance would naturally ease the pull of her luck on others. Once she left the city, she planned to delete Ethan's contact info entirely.

Back in her cozy apartment, Ivy changed into her pajamas and relaxed. She opened the fortune app to claim her weekly reward. The wheel spun slowly, building anticipation, and finally landed on a skill reward.

"Congratulations, Ivy! You've unlocked the 'Insightful Eyes' skill!" the system announced.

Ivy's heart lifted with joy. This skill would allow her to discern someone's potential in the entertainment industry—a perfect tool for her aspirations. Though limited to one hour per day, it was exactly what she needed to identify future stars.

With renewed excitement, Ivy looked forward to the possibilities this new skill could bring.
