Title: Self-Funded

"To drive a vehicle longer than 20 feet, you'll need a commercial driver's license," Jane Smith concluded her explanation.

Earlier, Stella had mentioned that the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter was intended for the company’s artists, implying she didn’t plan to drive it herself. Considering her background, she likely couldn't afford to hire a driver with a commercial license.

"Got it," Stella Ling nodded, realizing she'd need to hire a driver qualified to handle a bus.

"Alright, I understand. Can you show me another vehicle priced around $100,000, something with a great driving experience and easy to handle?" Stella suggested.

"Sure thing, Stella," Jane nodded. "Any particular brands you’re interested in?"

"No specific preferences, as long as it’s easy to drive and doesn't come with any controversy," Stella replied.

Jane hesitated for a moment. The brand of the vehicle Stella had just purchased was notorious for controversial marketing missteps. It seemed they hadn’t learned their lesson.

"Is something wrong?" Stella asked, noticing Jane's troubled expression.

"Well, it's just that the brand you just bought has had some issues with its public image," Jane began, but she was interrupted by her supervisor, Sales Director Mark Johnson, signaling her to stop.

Was he indicating not to mention it? Unexpectedly, the general manager, Paul Reed, stepped forward, gently nudging Mark aside, and explained to Stella, "I sincerely apologize, Stella. The brand of the business vehicle you just purchased has had some controversial marketing campaigns."

"However, the three business vehicles you bought have been customized, and their logos have been replaced with the KLASSEN logo. You can consider them as KLASSEN vehicles."

"If you’re not satisfied, we can arrange a return and let you choose again," Paul expressed sincerely.

Mark, who had been nudged, was left in shock. The general manager was willing to take a loss rather than risk offending this young woman. Who exactly was Stella Ling?

Stella never imagined that what caused this group to feel awkward was this specific issue. She glanced at Paul, sensing that he wasn’t being intentionally rude.

If there wasn’t a market for these cars here, the dealership wouldn’t have stocked them in the first place. She realized it was her own oversight for not researching past controversies beforehand. Stella understood, "It's fine; no need to return it. I'll regard it as a KLASSEN vehicle."

"Thank you for your understanding. We assure you this mistake won’t happen again," Paul slightly bowed in apology and signaled Jane to continue with the introduction.

Afterward, Jane led Stella away from the area with controversial car brands.

From this encounter, Paul and the others noted that Stella was particular about brands, and they shouldn’t recommend any with questionable reputations in the future.

Next, Jane brought Stella to a sleek, powerful-looking black sedan.

"This is a customized Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge, transformed from the Cullinan released in 2018," Jane explained as she opened the car door.

"What sets it apart from other luxury SUVs is its exclusive umbrella on the door. Press the button, and the umbrella pops out automatically."

Jane pressed the button on the side of the door, and an umbrella sprang out. She pulled it out and opened it, demonstrating it to Stella.

"This car targets younger drivers, with a black and white umbrella design for a more vibrant look. The handle is engraved with the iconic Rolls-Royce logo."

Jane retracted the umbrella, holding it above her head as Stella noticed the double "R" logo engraved on the handle.

Then, Jane placed the umbrella back and gently stroked the car door while explaining, "It features a unique exterior color called 'King of the Night,' a special hue for the Cullinan Black Badge. The paint requires over ten rounds of hand polishing."

Moving to the back of the car, she continued, "The rear design retains classic Rolls-Royce features while incorporating minimalist, avant-garde, and fashionable elements."

Jane picked up the car key and pressed the unlock button: "Press it, and the door opens automatically, showcasing its technological appeal."

Stella watched as the door opened, a wave of luxury washing over her, making her feel like she was experiencing the essence of wealth.

Following Jane's instructions, she sat in the driver's seat. 

Gripping the steering wheel, she was pleased with the feel; the entire interior looked luxurious. 

The black floor mats were made of wool. 

The dashboard featured carbon fiber accents, and the entire cockpit was wrapped in luxurious leather, topped with the iconic starlit ceiling of Rolls-Royce. 

Chromed seat adjustment buttons were located on the side of the seat, and the door bore the emblem of the Flying Lady.

Stella recalled that the car Ethan drove into school also had this emblem.

So, she and he would be driving the same brand of car?

At least the exterior was different; otherwise, she wouldn't even consider purchasing it.

At this moment, Jane leaned in closer to explain, "The speaker covers on the doors and all the buttons are chrome-plated."

Stella noticed a cover beneath the windshield that automatically opened to reveal the car's display screen.

"This is the infotainment system, and beside it is a Phantom clock. The hollow panel is made of carbon fiber, and both the air conditioning and volume controls are adjusted using knobs. Below, there are two cup holders for heating or cooling beverages."

"There are also several storage compartments on the central console for small items like phones."

"The central knob also bears the emblem of the Flying Lady, allowing you to control the entire infotainment system display."

Jane opened the rear door and continued, "Although it’s an SUV, the Cullinan also maintains the signature Rolls-Royce coach doors. Plus, with a length of 17 feet, it makes entering and exiting the vehicle much easier."

"Since the doors are coach-style, closing them from inside can be inconvenient. Therefore, there’s a button on the pillar; press it, and the door closes automatically."

Jane pressed the button, demonstrating as the rear door slowly closed on its own.

"The rear air conditioning control panel also features a cigarette lighter."

"The central armrest in the back needs to be opened manually, and it also has two cup holders for heating or cooling drinks, along with storage space for important documents."

"The seats are plush, designed in a black and white color scheme, making them look youthful."

"Up front, there’s a small shelf-like design that adds a bit more storage space."

Jane began operating the windows, saying, "The windows of this Cullinan are thicker than standard car glass, but they don't have bulletproof capabilities."

Stella stepped out of the driver's seat, glancing at the hood where the Flying Lady was painted black. She watched as Jane struggled to open the engine hood and continued her introduction.

"All Rolls-Royce models use a V12 engine. This Cullinan is equipped with a V12 twin-turbocharged engine that provides a maximum power of 600 horsepower and a peak torque of 900 Nm."

After finishing, Jane closed the hood, sat in the driver's seat, and started the car, saying, "You can listen to the exhaust note of this Cullinan V12."

Stella, not understanding much, directly asked, "So, this car is $100,000, right?"

Upon hearing this, Jane glanced at Paul, who nodded slowly, biting his lip, and smiled, "Yes, the final price for this car is $100,000."

After the payment, Stella turned to Jane, her curiosity piqued, "Is your store selling modified cars? Why have all four cars I purchased been modified inside and out?"

Jane: "..."

Jane was unsure how to respond, as these custom vehicles were specifically tailored for high-end clients.

Usually, Sales Director Mark Johnson was responsible for scouting such high-end customers, while she handled the sales pitches.

Before Stella arrived, Paul had specifically instructed her to recommend high-end customized vehicles, saying that affluent clients preferred unique cars.

Paul suddenly stepped forward, explaining for Jane, "I took the liberty of assuming that only high-end custom cars would be worthy of someone of your stature, Stella, and specifically instructed Jane to introduce those to you."

"Ah, thank you, I really like it," Stella replied with a forced smile.

Suddenly, she realized that both Manager Mark and Paul had been overly courteous towards her.

Was she really living in the 21st century? 

Why were these middle-aged men, who were quite a bit older than her, acting like they were beneath her?

Good service is one thing, but this seemed excessive...

Feeling like she still had some funds left to spend, Stella opened her phone and directly recharged her shopping card with the remaining amount.

A few days ago, she had also used her daily funds to recharge the shopping card.

This card could be used both online and offline, and whenever she wasn't sure where to spend her daily funds, she found it most convenient to recharge shopping cards or membership cards, or shop online to complete her tasks quickly.

Just as Stella and Manager Mark stepped out of the dealership, Mark rushed over to Paul, asking, "Paul, the final price of that car was $135,000, and you sold it to Stella for $35,000 less. How will you cover that gap?"

"… Sigh, I'll just transfer the funds to you later," Paul sighed in response.

Mark was left dumbfounded. He hadn’t expected the typically frugal Paul to cover a $35,000 loss out of his own pocket!

Despite owning several dealerships, half of them were operating at a loss due to poor management.

Moreover, since car prices were now openly transparent, it was difficult for dealerships to earn money just from selling cars.

The primary profits for dealerships came from factory rebates based on sales volume, insurance commissions, profits from car accessories, various fees, and the most significant income source came from subsequent car repairs and maintenance, which accounted for 60% to 70% of their revenue.

Typically, relying solely on car sales, rebates, and accessories, a car priced at $100,000 might yield a profit of just over $10,000. But with after-sales service and maintenance, the long-term profit could exceed $20,000 to $30,000.

Paul ran a boutique dealership specializing in high-end automotive brands, with significant investments, particularly in land usage fees.

If profits were normal, a single store could yield around $2 million a year.

However, with half of the dealerships operating at a loss and others not meeting profitability standards, the overall profit might only reach around $3 million a year.

Paul had even considered shutting down the poorly performing stores, fearing that continuing operations would drag down the profitable ones and ultimately cut into his savings.

While he had several million in assets, those who had interacted with him understood how frugal he was. He would haggle over clothing prices and even sent a $0.08 red envelope to Mark to help negotiate a deal on an online shopping platform!

At that moment, Mark finally grasped the truth: wealthy individuals didn't throw money around; they were truly frugal, whereas he was merely the kind who was "poor but generous."

Sometimes, Mark struggled to understand why those worth millions were so frugal in their daily expenses. What was the point of earning money if they were so tight-fisted?

Over time, he began to realize that wealthy individuals were shrewd rather than stingy. They assessed the value of products, sought out quality items, and still negotiated for the best price. 

But now, this astute Paul was prepared to lose $35,000 just to please Stella!

He hoped Paul's judgment would prove correct and that he wouldn’t regret this decision after the $35,000 loss.

In fact, at this moment, Paul's heart was bleeding.

His dealership actually had high-end customized vehicles priced around $100,000, but all those brands were controversial.

With Stella being particular about brands, he couldn’t risk having his subordinates recommend that brand to her.

He had to find another high-end custom vehicle from a different brand that was close in price and met Stella's requirements.

And it turned out they were $35,000 apart!

Hopefully, Stella was as impressive as Mark described her.

Otherwise...

Otherwise, he wouldn’t know what to do. 

On the way, Stella suddenly heard an inner voice in her mind.

"Stella, I just heard that the price of that Cullinan was $135,000, and Paul sold it to you for $35,000 less, planning to cover the loss out of his own pocket!"

Stella: "…"

Why would he do that?

Stella was confused.

"I feel like he wants to cry."
