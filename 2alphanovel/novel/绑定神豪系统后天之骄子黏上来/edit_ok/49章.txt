**Building with Money**

Stella Smith felt a wave of confusion wash over her. Mr. Thompson's generosity seemed out of character, especially since they weren't particularly close. Could it be that her connection with Ethan Lewis, the property manager, had something to do with this unexpected act?

With these thoughts swirling in her mind, Stella turned to Ethan with a grateful smile. "Thanks for your help, Ethan. I wouldn't have found such a perfect custom car without you. Let's grab lunch sometime."

"You're too kind, Stella. As someone managing this property, helping you is part of my job," Ethan replied, his smile warm and genuine.

"Oh, come on, let's not be so formal," Stella said, urging him with a light-hearted laugh. "I actually have a few things I'd love to chat about."

"Of course, it's my pleasure," Ethan agreed, curious about what Stella wanted to discuss.

After their brief exchange, Stella headed toward the street, intending to hail a cab. But Ethan stopped her, offering, "Why not take my car? It's parked just around the corner at the Financial District."

"That sounds great," Stella nodded.

A short drive later, they arrived at a cozy little restaurant Stella had stumbled upon online. Its rustic, homey feel was just what she was looking for, and luckily, a private booth was available for their conversation.

Scanning the menu, Stella decided to try a bit of everything from the house specials, then passed the menu to Ethan to make his picks.

"Whoa, that's quite a spread," Ethan chuckled, trying to decline some of the dishes.

The selection included everything from mouth-watering steaks and fresh Maine lobster to a hearty chicken pot pie and a classic apple pie for dessert. It was more than enough for just the two of them.

"Sounds good," Stella said, then added to the waiter, "And could you pack the same for takeout? I'll take it when we leave."

"Certainly," the waiter responded promptly.

Ethan was a bit taken aback. He recalled Stella mentioning she was new in town and wondered if the extra portion was for a late-night snack. She sure seemed to have an appetite for life.

As Stella sipped her iced tea, she reflected on the complexities of dealing with business folksâ€”they often danced around their intentions, and she preferred getting straight to the point.

"Listen, Ethan, I'm more of a straightforward person," Stella began, deciding to address the issue head-on. "Is Mr. Thompson expecting something in return for that generous discount?"

She absentmindedly toyed with her ring, her gaze fixed on Ethan as she awaited his response.

"Honestly, I'm not sure," Ethan replied, genuinely puzzled. "I was with you the whole time at the showroom and didn't catch any hint of ulterior motives."

Seeing Ethan's sincerity, Stella felt compelled to elaborate. "I bought a Rolls-Royce for $7 million, but the listed price was $9.5 million. Mr. Thompson knocked off a whopping $2.5 million. If he needs something from me, I'd rather know up front. I like to keep things transparent."

Ethan fell silent, contemplating the situation. Mr. Thompson was known for being frugal. In all their years, Ethan couldn't recall him ever treating anyone to a meal that wasn't fast food. Stella's gesture of treating him to a lavish meal was a stark contrast.

"Stella, I honestly don't know what Mr. Thompson's angle is, but let me reach out to him and find out," Ethan offered, pulling out his phone.

"Sure," Stella agreed, nodding.

As Ethan typed out a message to Mr. Thompson, Stella reflected on her own principles. If he needed her help, she'd consider it, but otherwise, she'd prefer to settle the $2.5 million difference. She valued her independence and had learned that fortune often favors those who maintain their own paths.

Ethan's phone buzzed with a reply from Mr. Thompson, who seemed equally puzzled by Stella's awareness of the car discount. Ethan couldn't help but roll his eyes at the reply.

"Seems Mr. Thompson was a bit overwhelmed. He didn't think through the implications of his gesture," Ethan explained after a pause. "He was just trying to impress."

As the food arrived, Ethan's expression remained thoughtful. Stella picked up on his concern and asked, "Everything okay?"

"It's all good. Mr. Thompson just got his wires crossed," Ethan assured her, then encouraged, "Let's enjoy the meal."

"Alright, but if he doesn't need my help, I'll insist on paying him back," Stella reiterated. She didn't want any lingering debts clouding her vision of the future.

Stella understood that in business, relationships were built on mutual benefit. Mr. Thompson's actions seemed to be an attempt to establish a connection, which could be useful for her new venture, Star Entertainment. Networking was key, and she didn't mind forming alliances, especially if it could help her navigate future challenges.

"Stella, I'll level with you," Ethan began, breaking the silence. "Mr. Thompson owns a car dealership on the outskirts that's been struggling for years. He's hoping you might have some interest in the property or know someone who does."

Stella considered the prospect. Turning to Ethan, she asked, "Can you tell me more about the location? What's around it?"

"It's in the tech district, close to the airport, surrounded by other car dealerships and has good infrastructure," Ethan explained, showing her the location on his phone map. "It's not the location that's the issue; the market's just flooded."

Stella pondered the information. She had noticed the fierce competition in the automotive market during her visits. After a moment, she asked, "Any idea on the lease costs?"

"Around $2.43 million annually," Ethan replied after a quick calculation.

Stella did some quick math. With five and a half years left on the lease, it would amount to a significant investment.

"Do you think converting it into a sports complex would be feasible? What would renovation costs look like?" Stella asked, her mind already spinning with possibilities.

Ethan's eyes widened with surprise. "Are you thinking of taking it over?"

"I'm considering it. I need to know the potential costs before I make any commitments," Stella replied thoughtfully.

"Demolishing and rebuilding could start at $5 million, but if you're going for luxury, it might be upwards of $10 million," Ethan estimated.

Stella nodded, her mind racing with ideas. "Sounds manageable."

Ethan was taken aback by her casual acceptance of such a hefty sum, but then again, he was starting to understand this was the world Stella operated in.

Inside, Stella was already communicating with her divine luck: "Alright, Fortune Genie, time for another spin of the wheel!"

**[You got it!]**

With her recent successes, Stella was feeling optimistic. She needed a lucky break, as her company funds were dwindling, and this venture could potentially cost her remaining $30 million.

Here goes nothing!

The wheel of fortune spun wildly, landing on the skills section.

**[Congratulations! You've acquired expert driving skills!]**

Well, that was convenient. No need for driving lessons now that she had a new car.

But she wanted more than that!

One more spin!

The wheel spun again, this time stopping on the physical rewards section.

**[5 minutes with an unlimited Black Card!]**

Stella's heart raced with excitement. This was the break she needed. She turned to Ethan with enthusiasm. "Ethan, let's make this happen. I want to sign the contract for that land and start the renovation process. I need your contacts for a top-notch contractor ready to handle a $30 million project today."

Ethan was momentarily stunned by the whirlwind of decisions but quickly got to work, contacting Mr. Thompson and a reputable construction firm capable of executing Stella's vision.

Stella was satisfied with Ethan's efficiency. She needed to finalize these deals today, ensuring that her Black Card opportunity wouldn't slip away with the next day's tasks.

Her plan wasn't just to create an indoor sports complex but to build a state-of-the-art performance venue for her artists. It was time to lay the foundation for a stage that would shine just as brightly as her rising stars.
