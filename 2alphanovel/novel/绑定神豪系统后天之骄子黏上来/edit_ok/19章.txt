**Resignation**

The group in the private room quickly realized something was amiss and hurried over to diffuse the tension, exchanging puzzled looks.

What on earth is going on with Luke? It's only been a day, and he's already starting trouble with his friends again?

Luckily, Luke didn't lose his temper like the previous night. After some coaxing from those around him, he finally calmed down, sparing the hospital another patient.

"Jason, what's up with you?" Eric asked, looking down at Jason, laid out on the floor. This guy's usually so timid. What made him provoke Luke today?

Before Eric could get an answer, Luke pointed angrily at him. "I should be asking you that! What's this nonsense about worshiping some fox spirit? Was that your idea?"

Hearing this, Eric shot a glare at his usually close buddy on the floor, but Jason covered his face, avoiding eye contact.

Now that's a real friend! Throwing me under the bus over his girlfriend!

"It wasn't me! I mean, uh, Luke..." Eric stammered, his eyes darting around, not daring to meet Luke's intense gaze as he moved closer.

"What do you want to say?" Luke's stare made everyone around him shiver. Not just Eric, but everyone else averted their eyes, bracing for a one-sided showdown.

Eric felt a rush of anxiety, worried he might end up like Phil, the last guy who crossed Luke. So, he confessed, "Luke, the thing about the fox spirit wasn’t my idea! I just mentioned you might have been cursed!"

Luke: "..."

What’s the difference?

He wanted to retort but then saw Eric spilling the beans like a kid in the principal's office.

"Luke, we’re really concerned about you! Ever since you met that woman at 'The View', you've changed completely!"

"The thing is, she's so ordinary! You could find a hundred like her on the street. She’s not at all like the type you used to go for!"

"But you're acting like she's got a spell on you, sticking to her like glue, and you even hit Phil for her!"

"Phil's been the most loyal to you! He was just trying to help, and you punched him!"

"This makes us wonder if she's done something to you!"

"Otherwise, how could you change so suddenly?"

As Eric spoke, the people around couldn't help but chime in.

"Yeah, Luke, it's like you've become a different person!"

"We were all shocked that day!"

"That woman does seem a bit off."

"Luke, maybe you should see someone about this?"

Most of them had seen Luke's transformation first-hand that day.

And Jason, the chatterbox, had already told everyone about what he saw at the hospital yesterday, warning them to be prepared.

Even now, they could hardly believe it.

Luke actually fell for an average-looking woman!

Seeing that everyone seemed to agree with Eric’s claims—nodding along or casting worried glances at him—Luke took a deep breath and slowly exhaled his frustration. "I have changed."

Just when everyone thought Luke was finally acknowledging his issues, he continued, "Because I plan to change for the better!"

"Who I like is none of your business!"

"Acting like you all know me so well. What's wrong with me pursuing the person I like?"

"Worshiping fox spirits? Cursed? Seeing a master?"

"I think it's you guys who should go get your heads checked!"

As he vented, Luke shot an angry glare at Jason, still sitting on the ground, and sneered, "Instead of gossiping about who I should like, use that brain of yours to figure out why your girlfriend likes you!"

The crowd felt that comment was harsh, making Jason's recent behavior seem clownish.

Many had been subtly charmed by Zoe's allure, either openly or discreetly.

If not for Luke's good relationship with Jason, they might have already taken advantage of the situation and spent some intimate moments with that flirtatious woman.

After venting his frustrations on Jason, Luke strode out of the private room.

Once outside the bar, he felt the air was much fresher.

He took out his phone, scrolling through apps as he walked down the bustling street, reflecting on everything that had happened since he met Stella.

He recalled her simple attire and how, when she returned the money today, she tried to remain calm, hiding the pain of parting with it.

He could tell that Stella's background was different from his own.

Yet she bravely returned the money, not owing him a cent, and left the Grand Hotel without hesitation.

At that moment, it dawned on Luke that perhaps any normal girl wouldn’t be interested in someone like him, a second-generation rich kid always hanging out in bars and nightclubs.

No matter how wealthy he was or how good his family background was, once they realized what kind of person he truly was, they would keep their distance.

Luke could use his family’s status to pressure others into submission for his own desires, but when it came to the person he liked, he didn’t want to do that.

Though it might seem like self-deprecation, seeing Jason sitting on the ground in such a sorry state made him feel as if he were looking at his own reflection.

They were both lost in love.

What happened tonight made Luke realize that no matter what others said, he still wanted to be with Stella.

So he couldn’t keep living like this.

He decided he would no longer linger in bars, nor would he hang around the crowd that frequented those places. He would go home and find something meaningful to do.

If Stella saw that he was making positive changes, she might reconsider her view of him and be more open to his advances.

Holding onto this hopeful expectation, Luke took out his phone.

Regardless of whether Stella was willing or not, he wanted her to know about his determination to change.

Luke typed out a heartfelt message, expressing his desire to improve himself and his hope to become friends with Stella.

After spending these past two days together, Luke understood that trying to win over Stella in one go would be difficult.

She wasn’t like the girls he had previously met, who would rush to him simply because he was from the Lu family.

To win her over, he had to take a slow and steady approach. Therefore, Luke reluctantly stated that he would start as a friend and gradually work his way up to becoming her boyfriend.

After reviewing his message several times and finding no issues, he hit send.

Luke: "..."

The message went through, but a glaring red exclamation mark appeared next to the chat window, along with a note saying,

"You are not friends with this person, and cannot send this message."

……

Mrs. Smith glanced at her computer screen, staring incredulously at the person before her. "Ivy, you want to resign?"

When she saw the resignation letter in her inbox, she was initially curious about who would choose to quit at such a promising time for the company.

But she never expected it would be Stella Ling!

"Is this related to what happened last Friday?" Mrs. Smith asked, concerned.

"No," Ivy shook her head. "I want to resign because I want to challenge myself with more professional difficulties and work for a professional translation company."

The reason for her resignation written in the email wasn’t as straightforward, but after hearing Ivy’s explanation, Mrs. Smith thought for a couple of minutes before nodding her agreement.

In fact, Mrs. Smith had sensed that Ivy was perhaps better suited for professional translation work.

Even though this junior had yet to graduate, her translation skills were exceptionally impressive.

The atmosphere in publishing houses or translation agencies might make her feel much more comfortable.

Mrs. Smith sighed and nodded, "Alright, I agree."

Ivy was an intern and could leave in three days, but she proactively requested to extend her departure, wanting to stay until her internship ended on the 15th of next month.

Since the company had a collaboration with International Trade coming up, Ivy sensed it would be a busy time and wanted to help out a bit before leaving.

Ivy even specifically requested that Mrs. Smith assign her more translation work in the meantime. With her specialized skills, she was ready to tackle any challenge.

Mrs. Smith gladly agreed but felt a twinge of regret in her heart.

Such a talented junior, and she’d soon be another company’s valuable employee.
