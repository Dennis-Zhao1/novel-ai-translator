**The Hundred-Meter Champion**

Stella Johnson shot out of bed faster than she ever had in her life, rushing to get dressed without even splashing water on her face. Her thoughts were laser-focused on her task as she dashed out of her dorm room.

Her destination was the small convenience store right across from her dormitory. It was the only place nearby where she could buy what she needed, and with time ticking away, it was her only option.

It was the weekend, so the store was bustling with students grabbing snacks and essentials. Feeling the pressure, Stella quickly grabbed shampoo, toothpaste, and a toothbrush. Holding $20 in her hand, she hurried to the checkout.

There were three students ahead of her, but their purchases were minimal, and she soon found herself at the register. After completing her transaction, she glanced at the clock and realized she had just two minutes left to finish her daily task.

**[Congratulations, Stella! You've completed today's daily task!]**

**[Next up: a random task! Keep up the great work, and the system will be cheering you on!]**

As the system's voice echoed in her mind, Stella sprinted towards the university gates. Today’s random task was set to commence simultaneously with her daily task, and she had 22 minutes left before the deadline.

Near the campus entrance, there was a mobile phone store. With an unexpected windfall of $1,500 in her bank account, she had to spend it, and her mind immediately jumped to electronic gadgets. A new phone or laptop would do just fine.

Since the phone store was the closest option, she decided on a new smartphone. Her old second-hand device, which she had bought for $70 four years ago, had definitely seen better days.

With just 10 minutes left, Stella burst into the phone store, her hair sticking to her forehead from sweat. She glanced at the phones on display and approached a sales associate. “I’d like to buy a phone around $1,500, preferably not over that.”

The sales associate smiled and recommended, “How about the Apple 13? It’s priced right around $1,500.”

Stella’s eyes widened in excitement. “Sure! I’ll take it!”

She could hardly believe it—she was actually able to afford an Apple phone! It was a dream she never thought would come true.

After some deliberation, the associate selected a stunning Midnight Green Pro Max version of the Apple 13 with 256GB of storage for $1,450. Stella also bought a protective case for $30, swiping her card to pay a total of $1,480. With the remaining $20, she topped up her phone plan, successfully spending the entire $1,500 before the deadline.

**[Task completed! Stella wins a system lottery draw!]**

Holding the sleek Apple 13 in her hands, Stella felt a rush of excitement. The joy of shopping made her forget the unpleasant experience of the previous night.

The lottery was set up just like the first time, divided into eight sections. Four random cash prizes, three physical goods, and one random skill reward awaited her.

With a click, Stella activated the draw, and the pointer spun wildly before finally settling on the random skill reward.

Another skill reward! Was this some kind of consolation prize? Her system was surprisingly generous!

When she received her skill, Stella was left speechless. She had unlocked the **Hundred-Meter Champion** skill! With this power, no one could outrun her within a hundred meters—not even the Olympic champion! However, once the distance exceeded a hundred meters, the enchantment would vanish, returning her speed to its normal level.

Moreover, she could only use this skill once a day.

Honestly, after gaining this skill, Stella felt a surge of ambition to represent her country at the Olympics. But as soon as she considered the limitations, that dream faded. National team athletes undergo rigorous training every day; they could hardly afford to only run a hundred meters once daily. With her unique, glitchy Hundred-Meter Champion skill, she would surely get exposed. It was better to stay safe for now.

**[Stella, this skill is still very useful!]**

**[If you encounter any troublemakers again, you won’t end up trapped like yesterday; you'll be able to run away in a flash!]**

“You make a valid point!” Stella nodded, her face lighting up with a smile. “Thanks! I’ll make sure to use this skill wisely!”

She was convinced that this time, the lottery was a special treat from the little kitty. Hopefully, next time she could draw the **Nine Yin Manual** skill. If she ever faced trouble again, she could deliver a swift **Nine Yin White Bone Claw** and see who would dare bully her!

Stella quickly entered the contacts from her old phone into her new device, which didn’t take long since she had only a few numbers saved. After restoring her old phone to factory settings, she headed to a nearby shop that bought used electronics, selling her old phone for a mere $2.

As she fiddled with her new phone, downloading all her favorite apps, she walked towards the university.

“Stella Johnson!”

Hearing someone call her name, she looked up and froze. Standing at the school gate was none other than the man from her nightmare last night.

Oh no! That jerk, Mike Lawson, had come looking for her!

In a panic, Stella turned on her heel and ran. But then she remembered that outside might not be as safe as inside the campus. At least the school had authorities and a dorm where she could hide. Surely he wouldn’t dare chase her into the girl’s dormitory, right?

With a gulp, she steeled herself and changed direction, hurrying back toward the school gates.

Mike felt a pang of hurt when he saw Stella attempt to flee from him. But then he noticed she seemed to change her mind and was coming towards him. His heart leapt with joy as he stepped forward.

“Stella, I—”

Before Mike could finish his sentence, Stella zipped past him and took off running!

He attempted to follow, but to his shock, he couldn’t catch up!

Stella’s speed was unlike anything Mike had ever witnessed. Having trained consistently in sports, he quickly realized that he wouldn’t be able to match her pace. He turned back toward the school entrance and jumped into his car to pursue her.

Meanwhile, Stella was too caught up in the thrill of her new Hundred-Meter Champion skill to notice the car tailing her.

Having already run past the hundred-meter mark, she was relying on her normal speed. Though she had left him behind with her skill, she knew that as long as he was still chasing her, she had to keep running. If she could just make it back to the dorm, she would be safe.

Panting heavily, she focused on her goal. As she caught sight of the dormitory building in the distance, a smile broke across her face.

Just when she thought victory was hers, a whispering voice seemed to curl around her, chilling her to the bone.

“Stella, you must be tired. Want some water?”

Stella turned, her heart dropping as she realized it wasn’t her imagination. The man she was trying to avoid was right there, driving alongside her!

Seeing Mike in the driver's seat, casually offering her a bottle of water through the open window, Stella felt her world crumble.

What was the point of winning the Hundred-Meter Champion skill today?
