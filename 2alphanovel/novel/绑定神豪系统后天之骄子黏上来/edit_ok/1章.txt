**Chapter 1: Something New in the Night**

The silver moon hung high in the night sky, a gentle breeze rustling through the air.

On her way home from work, Stella Parker absentmindedly kicked small pebbles as she strolled toward her college dormitory. Graduation was just a month away.

That meant she couldn't stay in the dorms much longer. She needed to find a place to rent soon.

Housing prices in the city were steep, and with more people moving in, demand was high. Rent was through the roof as a result.

As an orphan with no family to fall back on, Stella considered renting apartments on the outskirts, where prices were somewhat lower—even if it meant a longer commute.

Right now, she had nearly $1,500 in savings, scraped together during her three-month internship at a local company.

Stella had been looking at numerous rental listings in the suburbs. Considering the commute time and expenses, she had already narrowed it down to three one-bedroom apartments that required a deposit of one month’s rent plus three months upfront, with a monthly rent not exceeding $300.

These were direct rentals from landlords, and all that remained was to contact them for viewings.

As graduation approached, Stella knew she needed to move out of the dorm soon to resolve her housing situation and avoid a last-minute scramble when the time came.

But renting early meant spending money sooner, and she really liked living alone in the four-person dorm, so she wanted to delay her move.

It all boiled down to one thing: she was broke.

If only she were wealthy!

Stella sighed deeply, kicking a small stone into a nearby flower bed. She collected her thoughts and picked up her pace toward the dormitory.

Suddenly, a playful ding echoed in her mind: 【Ding! Target detected with a strong desire for wealth. Compatibility with the Celestial Fortune System is 99.9%!】 【System binding in progress... Binding successful!】

Stella stopped in her tracks, bewildered by the voice she was sure she alone could hear. Could it be that the stress of life had driven her to the brink of a mental breakdown?

【Hello, Lucky Star! I am the Celestial Fortune System from the divine 888 Nebula. I sensed your strong desire for wealth and humbly chose to bind with you. Please treat me well from now on!】

Stella raised a hand to her head, wondering why this strange voice was still ringing in her ears!

She couldn’t afford to lose her sanity now! Once she graduated, she could become a full-time employee at the company, and her salary would double.

With a brighter future just around the corner, how could she possibly be going crazy?

【Lucky Star, why are you patting your head? Hurry up and accept the first daily task released by this system: spend 10 cents within 10 minutes.】

【If you succeed, the reward will be the item you purchased with the task funds. If you fail, there will be no punishment, but the funds will be reclaimed by this system.】

Free money to buy stuff? Stella didn't believe it for a second.

She wanted to ignore the childish voice and just get back to her dorm to wash up and sleep. Maybe she was just too exhausted from work lately; after a good night’s sleep, the strange voice might just disappear.

Yes, that had to be it!

Stella resumed her journey back to the dorm, breaking into a light jog.

【Very good, you’ve sensed the urgency of the task!】

【The task funds are in your pocket, Lucky Star! Hurry and spend them!】

It seemed the voice had a childlike enthusiasm, stumbling over its words. Had she inadvertently created a childlike alternate personality due to her mental stress?

And how was she supposed to spend 10 cents?

In today's world, 10 cents wasn't much at all. Maybe the voice thought it was a fortune because she was so careful with her money.

With that thought, Stella found herself at the entrance of her dorm building, instinctively reaching into her jeans pocket. To her surprise, she actually pulled out a 10-cent coin.

A chill ran down her spine.

After losing her family, Stella understood the importance of money all too well. After losing her meal money once in high school, she had vowed never to keep cash in her pockets again.

She stared blankly at the coin glinting silver under the moonlight, lost in thought.

Returning the coin to her hand, Stella climbed the stairs to her room.

No wonder her right thigh had felt uncomfortable while running—it had been that coin!

But when had she even put this coin in her pocket?

Did stress come with intermittent memory loss?

As Stella entered her dorm room, she flipped the light switch, and the room was illuminated.

Opening her palm, she found the 10-cent coin was now damp with sweat from her grip.

She simply couldn’t remember when she had put that coin in her pocket.

Could it be that she was truly losing her mind?

Just as Stella was doubting her sanity, a fluffy, round ball appeared out of nowhere, floating in mid-air, and shouted at her, “Lucky Star, what are you dawdling for? You can’t buy anything here, and there are only four minutes left on your task!”

“Hmph! If you don’t like today’s task, this system will reclaim your task funds!”

Saying that, it reached out its furry little paw towards her palm, which held the coin.

Stella, quick as lightning, clenched her fist, trapping the fluffy ball along with the coin, and exclaimed, “That’s my money!”

“Then hurry up and spend it! If you don’t, this system will have to take it back!” The little ball tugged at its paw while warning her in a playful tone.

Feeling the soft, fluffy, and bouncy texture in her hand, Stella finally confirmed that everything in front of her wasn’t a hallucination—she hadn’t lost her mind.

A stroke of luck had truly fallen upon her, even if it was only 10 cents.

But 10 cents was still money!

For someone like Stella, who had to pinch every penny, this was free money she couldn’t pass up!

Without hesitation, she opened the dormitory door and rushed downstairs.

Four minutes left.

There was a small convenience store in front of the dormitory; she should still have time!

Stella sprinted down five flights of stairs at her fastest speed, narrowly avoiding a twisted ankle along the way.

When she reached the convenience store, the playful voice in her head chimed in again, reminding her that there were only 20 seconds left, and began the countdown.

Fortunately, spending 10 cents wouldn’t take long. On a shelf near the cash register, she saw what she needed.

A milk-flavored lollipop, just 10 cents each.

With swift hands, Stella snatched a lollipop from the shelf and slapped the 10-cent coin on the counter.

Seeing a student dash into the store just to buy a lollipop for 10 cents, the cashier couldn’t help but twitch her lips and explained, “Sorry, this lollipop has gone up in price. It’s now 15 cents each or 30 cents for two.”

What!

Stella maintained a calm expression, but internally, she was shocked!

She had never seen the price go up in four years of college, yet here she was, facing a price hike today!

【13, 12, 11…】

The countdown voice in her mind continued relentlessly, and Stella couldn’t worry about that anymore. She quickly grabbed another lollipop from the shelf and rummaged through her bag for 20 more cents.

This cloth wallet, made by her grandmother while she was still alive, was a zippered wallet with intricate embroidery, beautifully crafted, and she had used it ever since.

However, after years of use, the zipper had become a bit worn, and every time she needed to use it, she had to spend extra time to open it.

In the past, Stella had joked that this was her wallet’s unique feature, forcing her to take a moment to think about her spending. Now, it was just getting in the way of her free spending!

【…3, 2, 1! Time’s up!】

“Huh!”

Stella let out a long breath, relieved that she had made it just in time.

In the last three seconds, she managed to open her wallet and pull out two 10-cent coins to complete her payment.

Holding the two lollipops, Stella walked out of the convenience store under the cashier’s incredulous stare.

As the cool night breeze hit her, Stella's overheated brain finally began to cool down.

Well, in order to spend that free 10 cents, she ended up spending an additional 20 cents.
