Chapter 1: The Insightful Gaze

Stella Lewis, a 24-year-old woman with a drive to succeed, sat in her cozy office at Star Path Entertainment, a talent agency she had bravely established herself. Posters of popular artists adorned the walls, yet the room still carried a sense of anticipation—much like Stella's own aspirations. Today, she was poring over a stack of resumes, eager to discover fresh talent that could help put her agency on the map.

One resume caught her attention: Fiona Blake. At just 22, Fiona seemed to have a remarkable background. Standing at 5'5", she was a graduate of the National Sports Academy. What really intrigued Stella was Fiona's title of "National Champion" and her victory at the national martial arts championship in 2019. Starting her martial arts journey at the tender age of five, Fiona was skilled in several styles and proficient with weapons like the sword and spear.

Stella's smile broadened as she absorbed the impressive achievements listed before her. A national champion? Stella quickly grabbed her phone to research the significance of these titles. Reading through the information, she felt an overwhelming urge to exclaim, "Wow!”

“A 9.7 for martial arts performance? Fiona Blake must be a real powerhouse!” Stella thought, realizing that this resume was a goldmine she couldn't afford to overlook. Had she seen these credentials earlier, she would have immediately reached out to Fiona, even offering to cover her travel expenses for an interview.

Although Stella wasn't deeply immersed in the entertainment industry, she was aware of the film "Dragon Rising, Tiger Roaring," directed by the acclaimed Ethan Grant. While she hadn't seen it, she remembered its acclaim at international film festivals. To think Fiona had been the stunt double for the lead actress, Amy Sinclair, filled Stella with both admiration and a hint of insecurity.

Star Path Entertainment was still finding its footing, lacking a standout project to showcase its potential. How could she secure such a talented individual? Fiona's previous statement about stepping out of the shadows and into the limelight made perfect sense now.

Stella scrutinized Fiona's photo, noticing her striking yet approachable features. While she might not fit the traditional mold of a stunning actress, she possessed a certain allure. But looks alone wouldn't suffice; Fiona needed to captivate the audience as well. It was clear she aspired to shine on the big screen.

"Maybe some image tweaks could help?" Stella mused, though with a hint of concern. Would a martial arts champion even consider such changes? Would it affect her performance?

Caught up in her thoughts, Stella found herself staring at Fiona, who began to feel increasingly uneasy under the scrutiny. "Is she judging my looks?" Fiona wondered, feeling a wave of self-doubt.

Breaking the silence, Stella spoke up warmly, "Fiona, if you’re interested in joining Star Path Entertainment, I can outline a couple of exciting career paths for you."

"First, we could aim straight for the big screen. I’d cast you as the lead in a film, selecting the best scripts and hiring a top-notch production team to launch you as a female action star."

"Second, you could join our agency’s girl group, performing alongside other talented members. Once you’ve built a solid fanbase both domestically and internationally, you could transition to the big screen as an action star."

"Please, just call me Fiona!" Fiona interjected with a smile, her brow furrowing slightly as she pointed at her face. "But... am I really suited for a girl group?"

"Absolutely! It's completely doable!" Stella replied with enthusiasm, although she couldn't shake the feeling that having Fiona in a girl group might underutilize her talents. After all, she was a national-level athlete!

Feeling a surge of certainty, Fiona declared, "Then I choose option two!" Stella, surprised by her decisiveness, quickly led her to the office to sign the contract.

Later that evening, Stella treated the dedicated artists and staff to dinner, formally introducing Fiona to everyone. The atmosphere buzzed with excitement as Emma Johnson and Hannah Park learned about Fiona's credentials as a national-level athlete.

"Wow, our girl group is going to be incredible! We even have a martial arts expert!" they exclaimed, clearly impressed.

Sitting beside Fiona, Lily Anderson’s eyes lit up with enthusiasm. She loved anything cool and was instantly drawn to the new arrival. However, unbeknownst to her, while Fiona appeared fierce during training, she was just like any other girl, with a soft spot for cute and pretty things.

Fiona adored the color pink and admired Lily's half-dyed pink hair. But she knew such a sweet color didn’t fit her martial arts persona. It suited someone like Lily much better.

That night, as Fiona lay in bed, she reflected on her journey into the entertainment industry. With exceptional talent in martial arts, she had won the national championship at 19 and earned the title of National Champion. It was a year of glory for her, as she was invited by director Ethan Grant to join the crew of "Dragon Rising, Tiger Roaring" as a stunt double.

The film was a massive success, leading to another offer for a role in "The Stormy Road." Though she once again played a stunt double for the lead actress, the film's reception was lukewarm due to a weak script. Even with an award-winning actor like Thomas Quinn in the lead, the film flopped, impacting his career as well.

Fiona brushed off the failure of the second film, confident that her stunts had been executed flawlessly. But the subsequent offers that flooded in began to grate on her. All of them were for stunt roles, with not a single opportunity to appear on-screen herself, not even as a supporting character.

She felt a sense of pride typical of martial artists and couldn't help but think, "Why can't I get a role? I can fight well and I don't look that bad!" Frustrated, she turned down those offers and auditioned for roles with fight scenes, only to be met with the same outcome: "We want you as a stunt double."

It felt as though being a stunt double had become an inescapable curse for her. As resentment built up inside her, she channeled those feelings into her training. Her martial arts instructor noticed her distress, prompting him to ask what was troubling her. After she shared her experiences, he offered a sobering perspective.

"These days, it's not about being an action star anymore; the industry has changed," he explained. "With advancements in technology, special effects can handle what used to require physical stunts. The need for action stars has diminished, and opportunities are limited."

As she looked around the industry, Fiona saw how the star-making machine had evolved, with various types of celebrities competing fiercely for attention. The action star niche was being squeezed tighter, and it became clear to her that unless she built a fanbase, she would remain a stunt double as long as she stayed in this role.

Her looks didn't help either. Even for minor roles, production teams preferred hiring experienced actors with better looks, relegating her to the background yet again. Over time, Fiona's self-esteem took a hit, and she often felt inadequate.

But today, everything changed. She had successfully signed with Star Path Entertainment, where the benefits were enticing. Most importantly, Stella had complimented her looks! The thought brought a smile to her face.

"Joining a girl group..." Fiona's heart fluttered with excitement as she wondered what her instructor would think when he saw her performing on stage. Would he scold her for not pursuing a serious path? A hint of worry crept in, but the assurance that Stella had given her—building her fanbase first and then transitioning to a female action star—put her mind at ease.

On July 6th, the auditions saw 77 hopefuls, yet none met the standard. Stella's spirits dipped. The girl group had four members, but it still felt incomplete. Despite having dancers, vocalists, and even a martial arts performer, something was missing.

Stella's mind drifted to traditional arts—she envisioned integrating elements of opera and folk dance into their performances. The night before, she had stayed up late, researching various traditional performances that combined these genres, which inspired her to recruit members skilled in these arts.

With only two days left to find the right talent, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She planned to visit schools that specialized in opera and folk dance to scout potential members.

First on her list was the renowned New York Dance Academy. Known for its exceptional programs, it was a prestigious institution with a rich history of training talented performers.

However, since Stella was an outsider, she couldn't just walk in and start recruiting. Instead, she waited outside the school gate, biding her time until the students' lunch break. As she sat in the car, she glanced at her wristwatch—a classic timepiece. In just ten minutes, her Insightful Gaze ability would expire, and it was still only 10:30 AM; the lunch break was not yet upon her.

“Insightful Gaze has such a short activation time,” Stella mused to herself.

“Let me guess, you're frustrated?” her assistant, Zack, chimed in with a hint of exasperation.

Stella chuckled softly, “I can’t help it! I’m just trying to make this work!”

With a quick decision, she transferred the funds from her daily task into a company account. “Let’s head back to the office and regroup.”

As she settled into her office, Stella took a moment to reflect on her next steps, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of her journey into the vibrant, competitive world of entertainment, where dreams and challenges intertwined in ways she’d never anticipated.
