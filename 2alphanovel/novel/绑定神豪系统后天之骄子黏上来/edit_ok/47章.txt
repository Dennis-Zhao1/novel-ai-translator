**Triple Task Activation**

Before she knew it, June 15th had arrived—the day Stella Bennett officially left her job. With a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her colleagues, including Amanda, Jack, and others, before turning away from the company for the last time. As she stepped out of the office building, she glanced back one final time at the place where she had interned for three months.

During her time there, Stella had consistently exceeded her translation quotas, which led her supervisor to notify her during lunch that she could pack up early and head home. Raising her wrist, she checked the elegant emerald green watch adorning her arm, the dial showing it was now 12:05 PM. With no more work obligations, she decided to fly straight to River City to check on the company’s renovations. After all, she could stay in the luxurious presidential suite she had previously rented.

Around 4 PM, Stella arrived at the top floor of the International Financial Building in River City. She watched the renovation workers for about ten minutes when suddenly, a flurry of notifications pinged on her phone from the Celestial Fortune System.

**[Today's daily task is issued: Spend $1,500 within 30 minutes!]**  
**[It’s time for the weekly task: Spend $1.5 million within 4 hours!]**  
**[Random task triggered: Spend $1.1 million within 3 hours!]**  
**[Hehe, it’s a triple activation today!]**

Stella was stunned. Reacting as if she were escaping a fire, she sprinted to the elevator doors, pressing the button to summon the lift. When the doors slid open, she was shocked to find Mr. Johnson inside.

Upon seeing Stella, Mr. Johnson’s face broke into a broad smile. “Miss Bennett! Why didn’t you let me know you were coming to River City? Are you here to check on the renovations? How do you like it? Is there anything that needs improvement?”

Stella stepped into the elevator, feeling a bit embarrassed. “It looks great! No need for further changes, Mr. Johnson. I have something urgent to take care of now; let’s chat later.”

Unexpectedly, Mr. Johnson didn’t exit the elevator. Instead, he pressed the button to close the doors and proceeded to ask, “What’s the urgent matter? Perhaps I can assist you.”

“I need to spend money!” Stella blurted out, her frustration spilling over.

Mr. Johnson was momentarily taken aback. “…”

Realizing her bluntness, Stella felt a bit sheepish. “I’m sorry, Mr. Johnson. I have a tendency to shop impulsively; I just love to buy things.”

Hearing this explanation, Mr. Johnson felt even more uneasy, lamenting that such a luxury was a disease only the wealthy could afford. Nonetheless, he smiled and suggested, “Well, you can shop here. Our International Financial Building is a comprehensive commercial complex with many international brands and boutiques.”

“Is there a place to buy cars? I want to purchase a few good business vehicles for our team,” Stella inquired, her mind racing with ideas about how to utilize the funds from the tasks. 

“Actually, there isn’t a car dealership here, just a car wash,” Mr. Johnson replied thoughtfully. “But there’s a dealership nearby. I’m friends with the owner. If you need, I can contact him right away to arrange for the best cars.”

“That would be great!” Stella responded with a smile. “I don’t need anything too extravagant. I plan to spend $2.6 million on three business vehicles—one for regular use, so please prepare accordingly. However, I need the business vehicles to be top-of-the-line.”

Although Stella wasn’t well-versed in cars, she knew some could be outrageously priced, so she wanted to set her budget upfront. Mr. Johnson’s smile faltered for a moment. “…Okay, I understand. I’ll notify my friend right now. Let’s head over.”

Two point six million dollars! 

In his entire life, he had never driven a car that cost over $300,000. Watching Stella spend such vast sums without batting an eye, he couldn’t help but marvel at the power of someone wielding a black American Express card. But no matter how extravagant Stella seemed, she was still running a business, which meant she was likely in it for profit. 

Is the entertainment industry truly this lucrative? Spending so much just on initial investments!

Then, Stella and Mr. Johnson took the elevator down and exited the International Financial Building. 

At the Pinnacle Dealership, the salespeople were taken aback when the usually elusive General Manager, Mr. Blake, hurried into the store. He called out to the nearest salesperson, “Quick! Get your sales manager over here! We have a VIP guest arriving soon!”

After delivering this command, Mr. Blake straightened his clothes and sternly instructed the sales team, “Make sure your appearances are neat! No joking around—show me the best spirit of an automotive salesperson! Understood?”

“Understood!” The sales team responded loudly, quickly tidying themselves up.

Who could this VIP be? They had never seen Mr. Blake act this way!

Sales Manager Sarah rushed in, followed closely by Sales Director Tom. Upon her arrival, Mr. Blake gave her a thorough briefing, emphasizing the importance of serving the VIP well. He turned to Tom and said, “You don’t need to tag along. You’ve been a director for years; you probably forgot all the sales scripts. Just let Sarah handle the introductions.”

“Mr. Blake, what if this esteemed guest wants to build a long-term relationship with our dealership? Establishing good rapport, analyzing customer needs—this is part of my job,” Tom quickly countered.

Mr. Blake paused, considering the point, then relented. “Alright, you can come along too.”

With that, Mr. Blake positioned himself at the entrance, with Tom and Sarah following closely behind. Tom leaned in, curiosity piqued. “Mr. Blake, who exactly are we expecting? What do they do?”

Knowing more about the client’s background would help him tailor the sales approach effectively.

“It’s the president of a yet-to-open entertainment company. She’s a woman, and I’ve heard her background is quite impressive,” Mr. Blake recalled from a message sent by a friend.

Tom mulled it over. An entertainment company, female—this last bit of information seemed vague. If her background weren’t substantial, Mr. Blake wouldn’t be this anxious, nor would he rush to the dealership personally.

After a few minutes of anticipation, a young woman in her thirties entered the dealership. The moment she stepped inside and saw the lineup of staff awaiting her, she looked taken aback. 

“Wow, is this the kind of service you get at a dealership now?” she thought, marveling at the reception she had never experienced before.

Mr. Blake had just mentioned the VIP was a woman, and Tom quickly realized the bewildered young man who had just walked in was not their intended client. He swiftly signaled a nearby female salesperson to attend to him instead.

Seeing this, Mr. Blake let out a sigh of relief. Despite running over a dozen dealerships and facing many challenges, he had never encountered a client of this caliber before—especially someone with a black American Express card.

Previously unaware of such a credit card’s existence, he learned that only 100 of these exclusive cards had been issued worldwide, reserved for the elite, symbolizing wealth and status. Only by invitation from American Express could one obtain this card, making it all the more exclusive.

Imagining what kind of person could possess such a card, Mr. Blake felt his nerves heighten, swallowing hard as he stood by the entrance.

Tom and Sarah noticed Mr. Blake’s unusual demeanor, their own anxiety spiking. The atmosphere in the dealership grew tense and silent, as if they were under a spell.

After what felt like an eternity, Mr. Blake finally spotted his friend John entering, accompanied by a woman with fair skin and an ordinary appearance. 

Once inside, Mr. Blake immediately plastered on a welcoming smile, leading his capable assistants toward them. After a round of polite handshakes and small talk, Stella quickly expressed her urgency in buying cars, prompting them to move swiftly to the vehicle introductions.

With a warm smile, Sarah inquired, “Miss Bennett, what are your requirements for the cars?”

“I’d like to start with three business vehicles, preferably high-end models,” Stella replied, then asked, “How much do your best-configured business vehicles cost?”

“Our top-tier business vehicle is the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, this year’s latest MVP model, which has undergone luxury upgrades by KLASSEN. The total price is $540,000,” Sarah explained.

KLASSEN is a well-known brand in the luxury vehicle industry, famous for its perfectionist approach to interiors.

While Sarah spoke, she led Stella toward the car. However, Stella cut in before she could finish. “Let’s take three, all paid in full. I haven’t secured my temporary residence permit in River City yet, so don’t worry about the plates for now.”

“…Understood,” Sarah responded, a bit taken aback before quickly regaining composure. “Would you like to see the vehicle first? I can provide a detailed introduction.”

“Let’s just purchase it. You mentioned it’s the latest and the best; I can learn about it later,” Stella replied.

With only seven minutes remaining until her daily task deadline, any further delays would force her to use her task funds for online shopping instead. Noticing Mr. Blake signaling behind her to keep it short, Sarah promptly said, “Alright, please follow me.”

Five minutes later, Stella swiped her card, completing a purchase of $1.62 million, fulfilling both her daily and random tasks. 

Now with $1.05 million left and over three and a half hours to complete her weekly task, she turned to Sarah and said, “Let’s move on to the Mercedes Sprinter I just bought.”

“Of course,” Sarah agreed with a smile, internally questioning the service process being entirely out of order. 

They arrived at a stunning black, extended luxury business vehicle that exuded power and elegance. 

“Miss Bennett, this is the Mercedes Sprinter you just purchased. It’s the latest MVP model by Mercedes and a favorite among stars, wealthy individuals, and business tycoons,” Sarah elaborated.

“This Sprinter has been luxuriously upgraded inside and out by KLASSEN, making it more comfortable and adding many new features, including a PlayStation 5 gaming console,” she continued, opening the door and retrieving a controller to hand to Stella, while pointing at the oversized onboard television.

Stella didn’t know much about gaming consoles but thought that since her team might get bored in the car, they would enjoy playing games to pass the time. 

“Because this is the extended version, it’s significantly longer than standard Sprinters, measuring over 21 feet. Thus, reflective warning lights typically found on trucks have been added to the sides,” Sarah explained.

“The exterior has been completely upgraded, with the front grille replaced by the AMG black chrome grille, giving it a youthful and sporty appearance, rather than resembling a truck. The signature three-pointed star has been replaced with the KLASSEN emblem, and the entire bumper has undergone a blacked-out treatment. The front diffuser was designed and installed by KLASSEN, and the exhaust outlets have been swapped for AMG’s signature angular tips, with the taillights redesigned by KLASSEN as well.”

Sarah opened the trunk, continuing her detailed presentation. “The trunk is spacious and roomy. Underneath the mats, there’s a board that can be combined with the small table inside to create a larger working surface.”

“There’s an additional horizontal bar on the ceiling for hanging clothes,” she added.

“From the trunk, you can visually appreciate just how spacious the interior is.”

Sarah invited Stella to sit inside the vehicle. 

“All the seats can recline, and there’s a button on the side to extend the leg rests, which will automatically rise, but you can adjust the angle yourself.”

As she pressed the button, the seats began to recline as described.

“There are also two buttons for seat ventilation and heating, and in front, there’s a digital touchscreen where you can change the ambient light and adjust the air conditioning temperature. The ceiling lights’ colors can also be modified here, as can the ambient lights above the side windows.”

Sarah pressed buttons, demonstrating how the vehicle’s lights changed colors in response.

“This control system resembles a bar counter, complete with extra lighting below and several glasses stored inside,” she continued.

“The vehicle is equipped with a state-of-the-art air conditioning system, different from regular cars. It can cool or heat the interior independently, allowing it to drop the temperature by several degrees within seconds, perfect for the hot summers in River City.”

“Here’s a metal remote for the onboard TV. You can use it to turn on the television and pair it with the PS controller for gaming entertainment during long drives.”

“There’s also a hidden center console between the two seats that can be pulled out with a button press. On the center console, there are two foldable tabletops, which I mentioned earlier. The additional board in the trunk can be placed on top of these tabletops, creating a complete surface for work or dining, with curtains on all the windows that can be manually drawn.”

“The car can seat up to seven, with the last row accommodating three people. Each seat has its own armrest, ensuring no one feels cramped. There’s also a Berlin Sound surround system around the seats, along with storage drawers that pop out at the press of a button.”

“Additionally, there are USB charging ports and extra cup holders along the sides.”

Overall, it felt like a luxurious mobile office. Aside from the absence of a bathroom, this lavishly modified Mercedes Sprinter was practically perfect!
