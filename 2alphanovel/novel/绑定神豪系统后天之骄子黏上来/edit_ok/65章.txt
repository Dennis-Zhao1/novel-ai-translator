**33 Billion**

After resolving the rental issues for the Hometown Sports Gym, Stella Ling took her friend, Jess Carter, and others on a shopping spree through various high-end cosmetics stores. They shopped until noon, and it was only when the one-day usage of her American Express Black Card expired that Stella finally decided to call it a day.

Feeling a bit drowsy, she led her bodyguards and Jess to Dr. Smith's cosmetic surgery center. Once there, she found an empty hospital bed and lay down to catch up on some much-needed sleep.

Stella woke up feeling hungry and checked her phone, realizing only three hours had passed.

In the adjacent bed, Jess was recovering from eyelid surgery and a nose augmentation. She was scrolling through her phone with headphones on, bandages covering her eyelids, and her nose noticeably swollen.

"Does it hurt? Need some painkillers?" Stella asked with concern as she sat up.

"I took some already, so it's bearable," Jess replied with a smile. However, speaking made her feel a tightness around her eyes and nose, and she instinctively raised her hand to touch her nose.

"Don't mess with it! Just relax and rest," Stella chided gently. "I've got to check on the others."

With that, Stella left the shared hospital room.

Outside, a bodyguard from American Express, who had been standing vigilantly at the door, resumed his post beside her to ensure her safety.

She checked three more rooms to confirm all the girl group members were in good condition before heading out of the cosmetic hospital with her bodyguard.

As Stella was about to leave, she noticed her Celestial Fortune System had released her daily tasks. She planned to buy some tasty treats for her little kitty and grab a bite for herself after going over a day without food. She also intended to pick up fresh fruits and nuts for Jess and the others, as they were reputed to help recovery after surgery.

For their dinner, the hospital would provide suitable meals for their condition.

A quick grocery run at a nearby supermarket yielded an assortment of fruits, nuts, snacks, and energy drinks. Stella also stopped by a fried chicken joint to grab a bunch of fried chicken and snacks, ensuring there was enough for her bodyguards as well. Just before the task deadline, she allocated the remaining $50,000 of her task funds into the company’s basic account.

As she chewed on spicy fish cakes, she mentally conversed with the Celestial Fortune System, "I got you some snacks, and as for the fried foods, I'll order takeout once we're back at the hotel."

【Okay, but I want a ton of fried chicken!】

"Deal!" Stella promised with a smile.

Jess and the others had undergone minor surgeries, and after a restful afternoon at the hospital followed by dinner, they were given effective scar repair products before heading back to the Signiel Seoul Hotel around 9 PM.

Once back at the hotel, Stella ordered a heap of fried chicken and snacks for her little kitty. After all the takeout arrived, she shared some with Celestial Fortune before collapsing onto her bed, ready to rest again.

Unbeknownst to Stella, her shopping extravaganza quietly made headlines online in both the U.S. and Korea.

"Mysterious U.S. Tycoon Goes on Shopping Spree in Korea, Spending $33 Billion Korean Won in Two Days!"

This sparked a frenzy of discussion among netizens from both countries.

In the U.S. online community:

"How much is 33 billion Korean Won in USD? With Korea's economy, their currency denominations are pretty large."

"That's about $3.3 million."

"How many zeros is that? Let me count... one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, uncle, grandpa, ancestor..."

"Whoa, you just stopped at grandpa's generation, it's a total of $3.3 million."

"My goodness, by the time I get to my brother's generation, I feel like kneeling down!"

"That tycoon must be crazy! What could possibly be worth that much in Korea? Spending all that money!"

"Could it be that they acquired an entertainment company in Korea?"

"Didn't you read the article? That tycoon bought luxury goods!"

"Wow, buying luxury goods abroad for that much money, the rich kids from old money just got overshadowed!"

"Looking at the brands listed in the article, most are jewelry, clothing, bags, and cosmetics. This U.S. tycoon can't be female, right?"

"Why not? There are plenty of wealthy women. She might be shopping for herself."

"How could it possibly be for the wife? I’ve seen those tycoons, when they marry, they all sign prenuptial agreements to protect their assets. Men only spend this kind of money on their daughters!"

"Stop talking nonsense! My dad wouldn't even buy me a one-dollar ice cream, but he splurges on cosmetics and mink fur for my mom!"

"Have you considered that you might be adopted?"

"Whether this person is a tycoon or not, I just want to say, they're spending money like there's no tomorrow! So tacky! They could have saved that money for investments!"

"I also want to be that tacky..."

"A big shot who spends $3.3 million on luxury goods must have countless investment projects already. They're just spending a little to indulge themselves."

"Little money..."

"Spending over a million isn't tacky, it's grand!"

"After my assessment, this is fake news released by Korea. Everyone knows the U.S. has many wealthy people, and Korea spending money on such hot searches is just to stimulate us to travel and spend in their country."

"Damn! Now that you mention it, I also feel something's off! If you're going to buy, you should do it in Western countries, buying luxury goods in Korea seems strange!"

Meanwhile, back at her office, Stella's business associate, Alex Johnson, chuckled as he read the trending news on his phone.

Of course, it was a bit exaggerated.

These Korean people really know how to spin a tale.

Just then, Alex's phone rang.

It was his old friend, Mike Peterson.

Alex answered with a smile, "Hey, Mike, what's going on?"

"Alex, Miss Ling bought over $3 million worth of cars in Korea, and they're all being sent to our shop for maintenance! I wanted to ask what kind of license plate number Miss Ling might be interested in so I can get it ready for her."

"What? $3 million!"

Alex jumped up from his chair, astonished.

Then, as if remembering something, he asked, "Is Miss Ling in Korea right now?"

"Yeah, didn’t you know?"

Mike sounded surprised.

How could Alex have known? Miss Ling hadn’t mentioned it at all.

For some reason, Alex suddenly remembered the trending news he had just seen.

Holding his phone, he said, "I have to go handle something right now; we can talk about the license plate later!"

"Hey, hey, hey! Don’t hang up! What's the matter? Is it related to Miss Ling?" Mike asked curiously.

"I'll tell you when I get back!"

With that, Alex hung up the phone, took the elevator downstairs, and headed toward the International Financial Building.

When he arrived at the apartment where Stella worked, he found the door slightly ajar, and all the employees of Star Entertainment were busy unboxing deliveries.

"This set is for Jess; it will be sent to her room later."

"This one is for Hannah, and this set is also for her."

As Mark directed the employees in unboxing, he spoke.

"How much has Miss Ling bought? They’ve been unpacking all morning..."

Tina, who had just joined Star Entertainment as a dance instructor earlier that month, sighed while sorting through countless clothes.

"Miss Ling said these are all outfits for the company’s artists. There’s still more. Tina, please bear with it for the next couple of days; Miss Ling will pay you overtime," Mark said apologetically.

If it weren’t for Miss Ling’s requirement that anyone applying to the company must pass her interview, Mark would have posted job listings online long ago, and they wouldn’t be short-staffed now.

With the current shortage of staff, they could only ask Tina and two drivers to help out.

"Uh, do you need my help?" Alex suddenly interjected, startling the employees who were busy unpacking.

"Mr. Johnson, what brings you here?" Emily asked, putting down the scissors she was using to unbox.

"I need to speak with Miss Ling about something," Alex replied.

"Miss Ling is on a business trip in Korea and won’t be back for a few days. If it’s urgent, you can call her directly, Mr. Johnson," Mark stood up and answered.

"It’s not urgent; we can discuss it when Miss Ling returns."

Alex smiled and rubbed his hands, glancing at the pile of luxury goods scattered around. He became more convinced that the tycoon who spent $3.3 million in Korea was indeed Miss Ling.

However, he thought the amount in the news was a bit exaggerated.

Miss Ling probably spent around $400,000, especially since the cars being sent to Mike’s shop were worth $300,000. The clothing, shoes, and bags piled on the floor, even considering the brands, shouldn’t exceed $100,000.

Originally, Alex wanted to ask if they needed assistance again but noticed Mark had a rather apologetic expression and said, "Mr. Johnson, we have a ton of packages here, so it’s not convenient to entertain you."

"Oh, alright then, you all carry on. I’ll come back when Miss Ling is back in the country."

Alex sensed Mark’s intentions to politely send him off and gave a dry laugh in response.

Afterward, Alex turned and left the apartment.

With luxury brands all over the place, he wasn’t an employee of Star Entertainment, so Director Mark naturally wouldn’t ask him to help.

In fact, they were also wary of him.

Alex wasn’t annoyed at all; if Mark had readily agreed to let him help and called in other employees to assist, he might have second thoughts and later report Miss Ling for not managing her administrative director properly.

That said, if Miss Ling really spent $3.3 million in Korea, Alex seriously considered resigning from Longview Property Center to join Star Entertainment.

However, that was obviously impossible.

Besides the $300,000 luxury cars, what else could possibly account for the remaining $3 million?

Alex suddenly remembered that the trending news article mentioned the tycoon had visited several jewelry brand stores.

Impossible!

Absolutely impossible!

No matter how wealthy someone is, they shouldn’t go about buying jewelry like that!

They could host a jewelry exhibition!

After spending a week in Korea, finishing all her cosmetic procedures, Stella Ling finally returned to the U.S., bringing Jess and the others back to Chicago.

By this time, Stella had a slight redness on her face from the skincare treatment.

If you were to ask her how she felt after the treatment in Korea, her answer would be regret!

Had she known it would hurt this much, she would never have gone through with it!

Indeed, becoming beautiful comes at a price!

After the treatment, Stella had another thought.

That was her growing irritation towards the islanders who were living well!

She had to endure heavy anesthesia just to get a skincare treatment, yet the experience felt like torture, leaving her trembling and drenched in cold sweat, struggling to speak clearly!

Her ancestors from the mainland must have suffered even worse at the hands of those islanders!

In that moment, Stella felt an intense dislike towards them!

On July 13th, the renovations of Star Entertainment on the top floor of the International Financial Building were finally completed.

Because they used only the best materials, the wallpaper in the company was even edible once peeled off. Therefore, a week after the renovation, on July 19th, Stella and all of her employees moved into their new office.

Even though they used the finest materials, to ensure the absolute safety of herself and her employees, Stella implemented a series of protective measures to make sure they wouldn’t be affected by any harmful gases.

Sitting in her spacious office, Stella popped a slice of orange into her mouth while Celestial Fortune squatted on the desk, munching on an orange slice too.

To allow her little kitty to breathe freely in the fresh air, Stella had already announced its new identity to the company’s artists and employees.

Now, everyone at Star Entertainment, along with Mr. Johnson, knew that this plump calico cat was Miss Ling’s pet and could roam freely in the office.

Stroking Celestial Fortune's round little head, Stella instructed, "Celestial Fortune, some people will be coming in for interviews shortly, so you need to act like a normal cat later."

【Don’t worry, I won’t mess up!】

Celestial Fortune had now mastered the softer tones of speech, though it still dragged out the endings a bit.

Today, Stella was interviewing employees from various departments and assistants for the artists.

...

Rachel sat in the interview waiting area, observing the environment of the company before her.

It was big, but there weren’t many employees.

Moreover, she hadn’t heard of this company before, leading her to believe it was a new entertainment company.

Initially, Rachel didn’t think much of this interview as a remarkable opportunity, but after witnessing the administrative assistant’s courteous treatment of the interviewees, she felt the competitive atmosphere in the waiting area thickening, and she began to feel a bit nervous.

They offered free snacks, fruits, coffee, juice, and tea, and the administrative assistants were quick to serve everything to the interviewees.

This was the first time Rachel had encountered such a generous company for interviewees.

She wasn’t sure whether to mock the company for being foolish with their money or to admire the employees working there.

It inevitably reminded her of her own experiences as an artist's assistant.
