**Weekly Task**

After returning to her dorm room, Stella Smith tossed the shopping bag filled with sports gear aside and eagerly placed the rotisserie chicken meal she had picked up from her favorite local deli on her desk.

Since starting college, the most extravagant thing Stella had done was splurge a bit more on her housing to have a quieter, four-person dorm for better studying conditions. She certainly hadn't spent nearly a hundred dollars on a famous meal before. But after four years, she finally decided to treat herself to something special!

To commemorate this first taste of a renowned meal, Stella meticulously arranged the dishes on her desk. She even turned on her desk lamp for better lighting before snapping a picture to post her very first social media moment.

She captioned it: "First time trying the famous rotisserie chicken!"

"It smells so good! Can we eat now?" her little virtual assistant, a cat-like app on her phone, chimed in, its digital eyes wide with excitement.

"Sure, but remember to leave me half of that chicken!" Stella chuckled, recalling the app's insatiable appetite from the last time they "shared" a meal.

"Okay, okay!" The virtual cat nodded vigorously and immediately went for the mashed potatoes and gravy.

Watching the app enjoy the food so much, Stella put on a pair of disposable gloves and also reached for a piece of the chicken.

Although it was labeled as a meal for five, there was only one chicken, while the sides were plentiful.

The cold sides included mustard potato salad, a classic coleslaw, a savory beef salad, and a fresh garden salad.

The hot sides boasted black truffle mac and cheese, roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon, a hearty vegetable soup, pepper-crusted beef cubes, and garlic butter green beans.

The meal came with two servings of cornbread and a large bottle of sparkling apple cider.

Aside from the chicken, Stella's favorite dish was the mustard potato salad—it was creamy and tangy.

As for the virtual assistant, it loved every single side, even finishing off the leftover chives from the toppings.

Once they finished eating, Stella leaned back in her chair, sipping the sweet and fizzy apple cider, letting out a satisfied sigh.

The chicken was indeed delicious!

"Maybe I'll order another one tomorrow!" she thought, opening Instagram and noticing that her very first post already had likes and comments.

There were two comments, one from Ethan Carter and the other from her best friend, Anna Lewis.

Anna: "Looks so good! I absolutely have to try that when I visit you!"

Stella smiled and replied to her friend, "Hurry up and visit already! My treat!"

Ethan: "That chicken is pretty good, but you should try the one from The Roost sometime."

Stella quickly thanked Ethan for the recommendation: "Thanks for the tip!"

His response was prompt: "No problem!" followed by a smiling emoji.

The deli was the most famous spot in town, and Stella had never heard of The Roost before.

But that was alright; she had already decided that when her friends visited, she'd take Anna to both places to see which was the best!

After closing Instagram, Stella noticed another friend request on her phone. She didn't need to click on it to know who it was.

For the past two days, Mike Reynolds had been sending her friend requests, which Stella had ignored. Whenever he called, she would hang up and block him without hesitation.

Stella really didn’t want any more entanglements with Mike. After contemplating for a few seconds, she decided to block him on the app as well, ensuring she wouldn’t see his friend requests again.

Perhaps because she was happy from the meal, the little virtual assistant surprisingly began to tidy up the now-empty takeout containers on the desk.

As it cleaned, it hummed, "I'm just a little cat~ but I clean up just fine~"

Although the scene seemed a bit surreal, Stella genuinely felt surprised and warmed by the app’s helpfulness.

It made her feel like she wasn’t alone anymore and that she had a family member to look out for each other.

The next day was Halloween, but unfortunately, as a busy college student, Stella couldn't celebrate the holiday like she used to. Instead, she sat at her workstation, immersed in her translation project.

Until the afternoon, the app hadn’t issued the daily task.

Just when Stella thought the app might be slow today, she heard its familiar voice as she stepped out of the library.

“Ding! Were you waiting anxiously? Come and claim today’s daily task!”

“Spend $1,000 in 30 minutes!”

“I’ve been waiting for this!” Stella happily pulled out her phone and opened the food delivery app, ordering the same feast for her study group that she had enjoyed the day before.

“Ding! Ding! Ding!”

The notification rang three times, and Stella thought it was the app reacting to her order, but then it continued, “Congratulations, Stella! You've been with us for a week; now the weekly task begins—spend $50,000 in one hour!”

Fifty thousand dollars!

Stella was utterly shocked, her expression failing to keep calm as her mouth hung open.

So she had been with the app for a week already!

She needed to think about what to buy with $50,000!

A car!

But she didn’t have a driver's license and couldn’t drive at all; buying it would be pointless.

She could buy a small apartment in a nice area of a small town!

But she wasn’t planning to move to a small town, so she wouldn’t even be able to live in it.

The weekly task came so suddenly that Stella found herself at a loss for what to buy.

She needed to calm down. Instead of standing there in distress over how to spend the money, it would be better to head to the nearby high-end department store to search for her targets.

The best store nearby was, of course, Bloomingdale's!

Stella stepped out, her feet in her comfortable red sneakers, and hurried across to the building opposite her office.

Once inside Bloomingdale's, Stella opened a review app and quickly searched for the exact location of the “Chic & Classic” clothing brand section in the store.

In Stella’s mind, this brand’s clothing was the epitome of expensive!

She was pinning her hopes on spending the $50,000 here!

As soon as she entered the section, a stylish sales associate approached her with a polite inquiry about what she needed.

“I want to buy professional attire for work—something high-end!” Stella said, explaining that she was about to look for a new job and needed something impressive for her interviews.

The sales associate paused momentarily; did “Chic & Classic” have any inexpensive clothing?

However, she quickly realized that she had a big client in front of her.

Even though this customer’s outfit looked casual, the sales associates in Bloomingdale's knew better than to judge by appearances. The elegant associate smiled and said, “Ma’am, please follow me. We just released our Spring/Summer high-end ready-to-wear collection, which includes many professional styles that should meet your needs.”

The associate's gentle voice and warm tone calmed Stella's anxious heart a bit.

The first professional outfit the associate introduced was a yellow double-breasted herringbone soft wool blazer paired with a matching pencil skirt.

Stella glanced at the price tag and nearly gasped: $10,000!

So expensive!

But it was exactly what she needed!

“This one is great! I’ll take it! Do you have any other recommendations?” Stella said eagerly.

“Um… ma'am, wouldn’t you like to try it on first?” the associate asked with a smile.

“No need, I can try it on after I buy it. Let’s move on to the next one,” Stella replied.

“Oh, alright.” The associate nodded, slightly taken aback.

The second outfit was a purple plaid cotton coat paired with a matching pencil skirt, priced at $9,500.

“Great! I’ll take this one too! What’s next?”

“Okay,” the associate nodded.

The third outfit was a peacock blue and pink mixed coat made of soft wool, falling just below the thigh, priced at $15,000.

“Wow, that’s pricey! I’ll take it! Next!”

Stella was calculating on her phone; she was now approaching $34,500 but still needed about $15,500.

The fourth outfit was a black short-sleeve top with colorful prints paired with an open-back tie dress, priced at $6,000.

Wait, why did the price drop so much all of a sudden?

“I’ll take this one too. Can you introduce me to something a bit pricier?” Stella suggested.

“Uh, sure,” the associate replied, slightly confused about why the customer wanted even more expensive items.

“Maybe you could show me some bags?” the associate proposed.

Stella’s eyes lit up. Of course! The bags at “Chic & Classic” are super expensive!

“Alright, show me,” Stella nodded.

The associate then presented four bags that matched the four outfits she had selected.

The first was a light yellow lambskin handbag priced at $6,500.

The second was a purple grain-embossed shiny Maxi classic handbag priced at $11,000.

The third was a small black sequined metallic bag priced at $5,500.

The fourth was a large white retro cowhide handbag priced at $10,000.

“I still need $1,500…” Stella muttered.

“What? I’m sorry, could you please repeat that?” the associate asked, having missed what the customer had said.

She had to treat this big client with utmost seriousness!

“Can you show me some shoes? Ideally, I want to make sure I hit that $50,000," Stella said.

So, the associate brought out four pairs of shoes for her.

The first pair was a pair of goat leather sandals priced at $1,300.

The second was a pair of black leather flats priced at $1,200.

The third was a pair of black rhinestone high-heeled sandals priced at $1,600.

The fourth was a pair of black-and-white pointed sandals priced at $1,300.

After these, she still had $600 left in her task funds. The associate then recommended a pair of butterfly-shaped 18k gold earrings, adorned with pink pearls and red rhinestones, priced at $800.

Because Stella had earlier asked to make sure she hit $50,000, the associate offered her a discount of $200, making it an even better deal.

Stella was grateful to the associate for not making her spend an extra penny, just enough to total $50,000, completing her task half an hour ahead of schedule.

But the associate was the one who should be thankful to Stella!

Despite the many customers at the “Chic & Classic” section in Bloomingdale's, including those who spent even more, she had never encountered someone as easy-going and straightforward as Stella.
