**Random Task: Adaptation for American Audience**

---

It wasn't until the department supervisor arrived that Stella reluctantly returned to her workstation. From that moment on, her focus was clearly elsewhere, and the documents she worked on contained several glaring errors. The supervisor, Mrs. Smith, was infuriated and called Stella into her office, giving her a stern talking-to that left Stella teary-eyed.

During the lunch break, Mrs. Smith asked Stella to bring her lunch to the office. Upon entering, Stella noticed that Mrs. Smith gestured for her to pull up a chair and sit across from her desk. Stella felt a bit uneasy, knowing that this senior colleague had something she wanted to discuss, which was why she had invited Stella to share lunch.

Mrs. Smith noticed that Stella's meal was a basic brown bag lunch consisting of a peanut butter sandwich and carrot sticks. Without hesitation, she picked up a chicken leg from her fried chicken combo and handed it over to Stella.

Stella wanted to refuse the offer, but Mrs. Smith's insistence was firm, and she had no choice but to accept the chicken leg. Satisfied, Mrs. Smith began to eat while casually asking, “Stella, why did you switch workstations with Linda?”

“It was her sudden decision,” Stella replied after swallowing a bite of her sandwich.

“Why? Was there a reason?” Mrs. Smith pressed further.

“I don't know,” Stella shook her head.

Stella speculated that Linda's reason for wanting to change desks was due to the guy in the shirt across the office building. But that was purely a guess; what if it wasn't true? Remembering Linda's bizarre behavior earlier by the large window, Stella felt a lingering shock. She never liked gossiping behind people's backs, so she decided not to share her thoughts with her supervisor.

Fortunately, Mrs. Smith only asked a couple of questions and then dropped the topic about Linda, which relieved Stella as she focused back on her meal.

As she picked up the chicken leg that her supervisor had given her, just as it was about to reach her mouth, she heard the sound of the greedy Cat System salivating in her mind.

"Is it tasty?"

Stella couldn't help but roll her eyes in her thoughts: “I haven't even eaten it yet!”

“I can't give you the chicken leg. If I leave it in the lunch box, the supervisor will think I have issues with her.”

"Alright… then I’ll just watch you eat."

Suddenly, the chicken leg in front of Stella seemed less appetizing. In reality, it was just her imagination. The moment she took a bite of the fried chicken leg, a burst of salty, juicy flavor filled her mouth.

It was far from hard to swallow; in fact, she wanted to have another one after finishing the first. Outside of company gatherings, Stella rarely got to enjoy meat. It wasn’t that she couldn’t afford it, but rather she was trying to cut down on food expenses to save more money. Usually, she’d bring a simple sandwich for lunch. Occasionally, she would splurge on a meat combo to satisfy her craving for meat. Today was one of those days.

Unfortunately, luck wasn’t on her side, as the meat in her brown bag turned out to be just peanut butter. Although she found the sandwich filling, real meat was still more appealing. Fried chicken legs were unbeatable!

After the lunch break ended, Stella returned to her work. Perhaps it was because her supervisor had scolded her so harshly, but in the afternoon, Linda shifted her focus away from the large window and concentrated on her tasks. While there were still errors in her work, they weren’t as outrageous as in the morning.

Finally, it was time to clock out. Stella quickly tidied her desk and grabbed her bag. She wanted to rush back to her apartment, take off her uncomfortable shoes, and relax.

Suddenly, a message from the system echoed in her mind: "Random task triggered, spend 150 dollars within 20 minutes!"

"The task funds have been deposited into the host's bank account by the lovely system. Hurry and complete the task!"

The system prompt rang in her head like a clap of thunder, causing Stella to stop in her tracks.

“Ding!”

At the same time, her phone buzzed with a notification. Pulling out her phone, she saw that 150 dollars had just been transferred into her bank account.

“Bank of America notification: Your account ending in 3939 received 150 dollars on May 26 at 5:01 PM, balance 10,578.00 dollars.”

Stella's heart raced as she walked out of the office, internally asking the system, “Is the money that just hit my account the funds for this task?”

"That’s right."

“Is the amount for random tasks always this much?”

"Is that a lot? The minimum amount for a random task is always 150 dollars, with no upper limit!"

Stella’s fingers tightened around her bag strap as she felt a slight tremor in her hand. She kept moving, joining the crowd of people heading to the elevator.

Inside the elevator, it was packed, with people crammed together like sardines in a can. The excitement of the random task made Stella's heart race. Her breathing quickened, and combined with the cramped space of the elevator, she felt her shoes pinching her feet even more.

Trying to ignore the discomfort, Stella continued to ask the system in her mind, “Is there any problem with the account that deposited the money? Am I going to get investigated?”

"Of course not!" 

"All task funds issued by this system are safe and legal in the host's world."

"Plus, I am a system from the gods, from the 888 Nebula. With the current technological level on Earth, it’s impossible for anyone to trace it back!"

Stella felt her worries dissipate. Finally, the elevator reached the ground floor, and she flowed with the crowd out of the office building, heading straight for the nearest shopping center across the street.

That shopping center was located right next to the building where the shirt guy was. Stella quickly crossed the road and entered the largest shopping center in the city—The Grand Mall.

Pulling out her phone, Stella checked the reviews to find an underwear store on the third floor of the mall. With only 10 minutes left before the task deadline, she headed directly to the nearest store named “Luxe Lingerie.”

As soon as she stepped inside, a young and cheerful sales assistant approached her.

“Hello, ma’am! How can I assist you today?”

“I’d like to get this one and this one in a B cup, please.” Stella raised her phone to show the assistant the items.

The two items were priced at 75 dollars each, totaling exactly 150 dollars.

“Sure, ma’am! Please have a seat over here while I get those items for you.” The assistant led Stella to the designated waiting area for customers.

After about two minutes, the assistant returned with the two items Stella requested.

“Ma’am, I have the items you wanted. The fitting rooms are over there; please follow me.”

“Can I pay first and then try them on?” Stella was eager to spend the task funds.

The assistant paused for a moment, then smiled and replied, “Of course.”

She added that if the bras didn’t fit, Stella could exchange them as long as the tags weren’t cut.

With just 5 minutes left on the clock, Stella paid with her card, completing the random task.

"Congratulations, host! You have completed the random task and earned a system lottery draw!"

"Would you like to draw now?"

After finishing her payment, Stella was overjoyed but decided to hold off on the lottery draw for now. The assistant led her to the fitting room.

The two bras Stella bought were one in a deep blue with a flowing pattern and another in a lavender lace design. Both were quite comfortable and fit perfectly, making Stella reluctant to take them off.

However, she had a bit of a cleanliness obsession; even though she tried them on, she insisted on washing new bras before wearing them.

After putting on the tight-fitting bra again, Stella didn’t rush back to her apartment. She told the assistant she felt a bit tired and wanted to sit for a while in the rest area.

The assistant gladly obliged and even brought Stella a cup of complimentary coffee to enjoy.

Sipping the coffee contentedly, Stella looked around at the dreamy, fairy-tale-themed decor of the lingerie store.

The Grand Mall truly lived up to its reputation as a high-end commercial hub; even the lingerie stores were so upscale.

The staff were also incredibly friendly. Regardless of the fact that Stella was purchasing from the store's lower price range, the assistant didn’t show her any disdain.

Nothing like the condescending behavior she had seen in those melodramatic dramas she watched while studying languages.

Looking out through the large windows of the rest area, the sunset cast a golden glow over the bustling streets, creating a breathtaking view that put her at ease.

After finishing her coffee, Stella notified the system that she was ready to draw her lottery.

The next moment, a spinning golden wheel appeared before her eyes.
