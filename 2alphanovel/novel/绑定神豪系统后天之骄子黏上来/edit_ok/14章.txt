**Medicinal Cuisine**

After receiving the call, Liam Anderson abruptly rolled out of bed with a loud thud, startling the woman lying beside him. She shivered all over, clutching the sheets closer.

"Ethan, why are you at the hospital? Are you alright?" Liam asked anxiously, his voice still groggy from sleep.

"No, I'm fine. Just bring me what I asked for. Make sure to order that dish that's good for boosting blood and calcium levels, you know, something healthy for someone with a weak constitution. The other dish can be anything, just pick something," Ethan replied before abruptly hanging up.

As Liam remembered Ivy's medical report, he couldn't help but frown deeply. Not only was she anemic and calcium-deficient, but her overall health was precarious.

How had she been living? Was she not eating properly?

Despite her burst of energy when she ran off, her physical condition was so poor!

If her body was in better shape, she wouldn't have experienced such severe cramps in her legs.

It seems that moving forward, he needed to make sure Ivy had proper meals, aiming to help her become healthy and strong.

Right now, she was a bit too thin; when he held her, she felt almost as light as those actresses. But those actresses had to stay slim for the camera, which made sense.

Ivy didn’t have to worry about that. Her priority should be to be healthy.

If possible, he also wanted to take Ivy to exercise together.

The energy she had shown while escaping made Ethan see her potential in running.

It would be a real shame to waste such talent.

Moreover, exercising together would not only improve her physical fitness but also increase their time spent together.

Standing alone in the hospital corridor, Ethan was lost in his pleasant thoughts, not even considering whether Ivy would agree to work out with him.

In the bedroom, a striking woman with alluring looks noticed her benefactor hastily getting out of bed and dressing up. She tilted her head, curious, and asked, "Why the rush? Is Ethan sick?"

"No, it's probably his new interest who's unwell." Liam replied while adjusting his shirt.

"New interest? Has Ethan changed partners again?" The woman's eyes flashed with curiosity as she casually asked.

"Seems so. Apparently, it's a newcomer introduced by Henry. I heard she not only had a run-in with Seth but also caused quite a scene at 'Vista,' even getting herself arrested," Liam replied.

He hadn't gone to the club with Ethan and Seth the previous night, but he'd heard about the incident where Seth got a severe beating from Ethan, which even attracted police attention.

The trouble seemed to have started because of a woman named Megan, who was brought in by Henry.

Liam was puzzled; wasn’t Seth known as Ethan’s most loyal follower? How could he argue with Ethan over a woman?

She must be incredibly captivating to sway someone so devoted to Ethan!

A classic case of a captivating woman stirring up trouble!

"The newcomer brought in by Henry? Is her name really Megan?" The alluring woman pressed on.

"Yeah, that sounds right!" Liam nodded, turning to look at her. "Do you know her? What's she like? Is she pretty?"

"Why are you so curious about her?"

The woman pouted, pretending to be jealous, turning her head away from Liam.

Seeing this, Liam quickly moved closer, wrapping his arms around her in a comforting manner. "Come on, why are you getting jealous~"

"You know I have different tastes than Ethan. He likes the pure and cute type, but I prefer your kind of voluptuous, sexy beauty."

As he spoke, Liam playfully pinched the woman’s cheek and planted a kiss on her slightly smudged lips.

"You’re so annoying~"

The woman playfully protested, shyly pushing against his chest.

Then, her delicate hand, with nails painted a soft rose, slid down Liam’s chest. When it reached just above his navel, it was caught by his larger hand.

"Hey, stop it!"

Liam held her hand in surrender, "I still need to take care of things for Ethan! Once I’m done, I’ll come back and keep you company."

With that, he let go of her hand and continued getting dressed.

Before leaving, he leaned in close again and planted a kiss on her forehead. "Be good; I’ll be back as soon as I finish my errands."

Watching Liam’s figure disappear through the door, the woman spat in the direction of the exit.

"Pfft! You pig, who wants you to keep me company!"

Not only that, but she also raised her hand to harshly wipe her lips and forehead, even rubbing her entire body, as if to erase his touch.

After self-abusing to the point of reddening her skin, she finally stopped, turned around, and grabbed her phone from the bedside table. She sent a message to Henry via text.

"Henry, I recently got a spot on a variety show where I can be a special guest. I heard you have a newcomer named Megan who looks pretty good. Can you send me her photo? If she's suitable, I can bring her onto this variety show as a regular guest, just to warm her up before her debut."

Henry replied quickly, sending her a picture right away.

"Thanks, Sarah. This is the newcomer I just brought in."

Sarah scrutinized the woman in the photo; she indeed fit Ethan’s aesthetic.

With a heart-shaped face and delicate features, she looked pure and beautiful, like the recognized campus beauty.

She was only slightly prettier than those influencers online.

A wave of jealousy washed over Sarah as she threw her phone onto the bed.

What’s wrong with people nowadays? Why do they all like that kind of immature, skinny girl?

Wasn’t her own fair skin and voluptuous figure still appealing?

Didn’t they say that men love flashy and cheap women?

Thinking back to when she first got involved with Ethan’s crew, only Liam had shown any interest in her, which made Sarah feel like she could spit blood in frustration.

She wanted a handsome, wealthy benefactor too! Not a pig of a nouveau riche!

Just as Sarah lamented her worthlessness, Henry sent another message.

Sarah reached for her phone from the bed, puzzled as she stared at the screen.

Henry asked her if she was satisfied with Megan and whether she could appear on the variety show.

Being a regular guest wouldn’t give her much screen time; why was Henry so eager for this minor opportunity?

Having already connected with Ethan, wouldn’t the resources come pouring in later?

Women’s intuition is sharp; she quickly sensed something was off.

Could it be that Ethan beating Seth was not about this newcomer at all?

Once the seed of doubt is planted, it takes root and is hard to uproot.

Most suspiciously, just seconds later, Henry sent another message, asking her again if Megan could appear on the show.

Sarah thought for a moment and replied that the director had not yet given a response and that she would inform Henry once there was news.

Feeling disappointed by this response, Henry fell silent, since such a reply often means rejection in the entertainment industry.

Meanwhile, Liam had obtained the healthy cuisine and was speeding toward the hospital.

Upon arriving, Liam sent a message to Ethan.

He hadn't walked long within the hospital when he spotted a familiar figure.

"Ethan, why did you come in person? I could have delivered it to you!" Liam called out as he jogged toward him, holding the healthy cuisine.
