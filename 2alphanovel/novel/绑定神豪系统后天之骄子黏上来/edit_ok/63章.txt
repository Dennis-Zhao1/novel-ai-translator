**Chapter 1: Journey to South Korea**

On a warm July afternoon, Stella Lang signed an artist contract with Claire Lewis, who had brought her family along to visit the company. Claire's parents were initially wary of their daughter entering the entertainment industry, but after reviewing the contract's terms, they saw the potential for her to thrive. Starry Entertainment had a reputation for treating its artists well, which eased their concerns.

Claire's friend, Mia Anderson, couldn't help but feel a pang of envy. She, too, dreamed of a career in the entertainment industry, but she knew that General Lang of Starry Entertainment wasn't interested in her portfolio. Even asking Claire for help might come off as desperate and could harm Claire's standing with General Lang.

Mia sighed deeply. It seemed her dreams were just not meant to be.

Sensing her friend's disappointment, Claire squeezed Mia's hand reassuringly. She valued their friendship too much to let career aspirations come between them.

Stella noticed the subtle tension between the friends but remained focused. Claire's potential in the industry was undeniable, and Stella had her standards to uphold.

Claire had her passport ready, while the other members of their budding girl group—June Parker, Megan Song, Felicity Hart, and Yvonne Young—had scrambled the day before to expedite theirs. That morning, their passports arrived, and they quickly applied for visas to South Korea.

Once Claire's visa was sorted, they were all set for their journey to this new frontier of beauty and opportunity.

Stella had already invested in a professional team in South Korea to learn about the top cosmetic surgery institutions, hoping it would be worth every penny.

The next morning, with visas in hand, Stella booked eight flights to South Korea, and they set off together with the girl group.

At 5 AM on July 11th, they landed at Incheon International Airport. Upon arrival, Stella was greeted by the team from HanMei, whom she had engaged to assist them.

HanMei acted as a bridge for international clients seeking cosmetic procedures in South Korea, renowned for its expertise. As Stella and her group were from the United States, HanMei had arranged for English-speaking staff to welcome them.

"No need for a translator; I speak Korean," Stella announced confidently.

The HanMei staff and the translator were surprised by her fluency, devoid of any foreign accent.

Her group members were equally impressed by General Lang's linguistic skills. 

"Wow, Miss Lang, your Korean is impeccable!" the staff praised. "Are you of Korean descent?"

"No, I'm not," Stella replied in Korean, smiling.

Impressed by her language skills, the staff's respect for Stella grew. In many cultures, speaking the local language is seen as a sign of respect and connection.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at HanMei's headquarters in the bustling business district of Seoul.

In the high-end client reception area, Stella wasted no time. "I'd like to gather information about the surgeons who have worked with these celebrities. Can you set that up for me?" she asked, showing her phone to the staff member.

The staff member scrolled through photos of celebrities once hailed as natural beauties. However, the truth about their surgeries had been exposed, stunning audiences worldwide.

During that time, people were eager to discover which hospitals had performed the miraculous transformations, leading to a flurry of speculation and false claims by certain clinics.

"Miss Lang, most of the doctors who performed those surgeries are retired now," the staff explained.

Stella nodded, having anticipated this. "Are there any with similar skills and aesthetics?"

The staff introduced several surgeons, but Stella's discerning eye was skeptical.

"Can you arrange meetings with these surgeons, preferably all together?" Stella inquired.

The staff hesitated, knowing the logistical challenge. "If that's not possible, I can meet them individually," Stella offered.

"Alright, we'll arrange that," the staff member agreed after a pause.

Jin, the staff member, found Stella to be an intriguing client. Most would have accepted recommendations without question, but Stella's insistence on meetings showed her dedication.

After settling Xu and the others at a nearby hotel, Stella headed to a duty-free shop, planning to buy gifts for the surgeons.

A little gift can go a long way in business, after all.

At the duty-free store, Stella heard a familiar voice echo in her mind.

"Today's task: Spend $15,000 within 30 minutes. Random task: Spend $3.5 million within 8 hours," the voice prompted.

"Alright," Stella replied with a grin.

She went straight to the liquor section, selecting five bottles of premium whiskey and five bottles of fine brandy, knowing their popularity in South Korea.

With the remaining funds, Stella bought snacks and summer outfits.

In the afternoon, Stella met with five surgeons, presenting gifts to two. Only two met her standards: one specialized in double eyelid procedures, and the other in nose surgeries. Her insight classified them as top-tier, while the others were mid-level.

Stella informed HanMei that she needed an expert in wrinkle procedures and made it clear that invasive bone surgeries were off the table for her group.

Initially, Jin thought Stella was too particular, but after receiving a gift, he was more than happy to assist further.

By day's end, Stella had spent $3.49 million, with three hours left for the task.

She planned to buy more gifts to ensure the surgeons' best work, knowing post-operative care was crucial.

The next day, Stella found a top-level expert in wrinkle procedures.

In the afternoon, she arranged a meeting with the three favored surgeons at a high-end restaurant. Initially hesitant about meeting together, the surgeons soon appreciated Stella's generosity and promised to prioritize her clients.

That evening, Dr. Lee returned home, gifts in hand.

"Why the gifts?" his wife asked, delighted.

"These are from a client," Dr. Lee replied proudly.

"A client? Did you perform surgery on a celebrity?" she teased.

"No, from a major client from the U.S. who values my skills," he explained.

"Wow, such generosity!" she marveled, urging him to treat the new clients well.

"Of course," Dr. Lee agreed, though he recalled the stress of operating on his wife.

On their third day in South Korea, Stella brought Xu and the others to a cosmetic surgery hospital, heading straight to the director's office.

Inside, alongside the hospital director, were surgeons from other hospitals—a rare collaboration that piqued the curiosity of the staff, signaling the importance of Stella's visit.
