### Side Effects of the System

After returning to her dorm, Stella Smith unwrapped a lollipop and popped it into her mouth, settling into her chair as she pulled out her phone. She was determined to find any information about the **Celestial Fortune System**, the mysterious gadget that seemed light-years ahead of Blue Star’s current technology. 

The results were unsurprising. Her search was flooded with fantastical tales of male protagonists wielding similar systems to amass fortunes, dominate social hierarchies, and live lives of unparalleled luxury. Lavish parties, envious rivals, and adoring admirers—it was a recurring theme in every result. But unlike those heroes, Stella’s experience was... less glamorous. Her starter fund? A measly dime. It was hardly enough to get a single snack, let alone kickstart an empire.

Her gaze drifted to the small, fluffy creature perched on her desk. Unlike the abstract systems described in novels, hers had a physical form—a kitten no larger than her hand. Its fur was a whimsical mix of black, white, and orange, and its sharp green eyes were currently fixated on her lollipop.

“Want one?” Stella rummaged through her backpack and pulled out a spare candy. “Can you even eat this?”

“Absolutely!” the kitten declared, nodding eagerly. Its tiny head bobbed like a nodding figurine.

Stella blinked. The kitten’s reply was one thing, but its movements were almost too precise. She watched in awe as it unwrapped the candy with its paws, its dexterity rivaling that of a human. Within moments, the lollipop was in its mouth, and it was sucking on it like it had been born for this exact purpose.

“You’re... something else,” Stella muttered, unable to suppress her amazement. No real kitten could pull that off.

“It’s no big deal,” the system replied nonchalantly. “I don’t need to eat, but if you’ve got leftovers, I’m happy to help! Think of me as your personal trash can.”

Stella chuckled, shaking her head. “Thanks, but I think I’m good.”

The kitten polished off the candy, discarding the stick with the precision of a professional marksman. “Don’t worry! Tomorrow, I’ll grant you more task funds so we can get more lollipops!” It winked at her, clearly scheming for future treats.

Stella reached out to scratch its chin, smiling at its antics. The system might have been unconventional, but it had its charms. Feeling more relaxed, she decided to probe deeper into its capabilities.

“So, what exactly can you do?” she asked, leaning back in her chair.

The kitten puffed out its chest, its tail swishing with pride. “I’m glad you asked! Here’s how it works: I provide you with daily task funds. You complete a task, and you get to keep whatever you buy with those funds. If you fail, there’s no punishment—just no reward.”

Stella raised an eyebrow. “No punishment? That sounds... too easy.”

“Of course, there’s more!” the kitten added. “Weekly, monthly, and annual tasks will appear as you progress. Plus, there are random tasks that offer special rewards. Sometimes, you can even enter the system lottery and win cash, rare items, or new skills.”

“Skills?” Stella perked up. “Like what?”

“Well...” The kitten hesitated, pawing at its whiskers. “The prize pool changes, so I can’t reveal it yet. But trust me, it’s worth it.”

“Convenient,” Stella muttered. “What else?”

“Privacy!” the kitten continued proudly. “Unlike some systems, I don’t read your thoughts unless you communicate directly with me. No creepy monitoring, no invasive data collection. I respect boundaries.”

“Surprisingly considerate,” Stella admitted, though her skepticism lingered. It felt too good to be true. A system that handed out money with no strings attached? There had to be a catch.

“See? I’m the best system ever!” the kitten declared smugly, swiping at an invisible fly. “Anyway, that’s all for now.”

Stella frowned. “That’s it? No hidden costs? No fine print?”

The kitten hesitated, its tail flicking nervously. “Well... there might be a slight side effect.”

“There it is,” Stella sighed. “What kind of side effect?”

The kitten shuffled its paws, avoiding her gaze. “You might... attract Heaven’s Chosen Ones.”

Stella blinked. “Wait, you mean... romantically?”

“Yes,” the kitten confirmed, nodding. “Not chased or attacked—pursued.”

Stella couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s the side effect? Please. Who’d even bother with someone like me?”

The kitten tilted its head, genuinely confused by her skepticism. “You’re not without charm. Your fair skin masks a few flaws.”

“Gee, thanks,” Stella said dryly, glancing at her arms. Her reflection in the mirror showed the same face she saw every day: average, unremarkable. She wasn’t someone who’d stand out in a crowd, let alone attract some mythical “Heaven’s Chosen Ones.”

“Don’t underestimate yourself,” the kitten urged. “You’d be surprised how much fate can change with just a little push.”

“Sure, whatever,” Stella muttered, stifling a yawn. She waved the kitten off and stood up, stretching. “We’ll see if this side effect even matters. For now, I’ve got work in the morning.”

The next morning, Stella woke to the blaring sound of her alarm. Groaning, she dragged herself out of bed and shuffled to her desk, still half-asleep. Her phone buzzed with a new notification, and she reluctantly opened it to check the system’s daily task.

**Task: Deliver a coffee to Room 305. Funds: $10.**

“Coffee delivery?” she muttered. “This is what my life has come to?”

But as mundane as it sounded, something about the task felt... off. Stella couldn’t shake the feeling that even this seemingly simple errand might lead to complications. After all, with a system like hers, nothing was ever as straightforward as it seemed.

She grabbed her jacket and headed out, determined to get it over with. Little did she know, Room 305—and the person waiting inside—would be the beginning of her next unexpected adventure.
