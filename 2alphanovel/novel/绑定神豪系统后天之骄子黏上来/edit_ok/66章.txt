**Artist Assistant**

The salary of an artist assistant isn’t as glamorous as some might think. Most earn between $400 and $800 a month, far from the inflated numbers often discussed online. Zhang Qian, now Jenny, has been an artist assistant for five years, supporting three different artists, and she’s never come across anyone in her field making more than $2,600 a month. Even with the constant travel and long hours on set, the pay usually hovers around $1,300. Sure, there are holiday bonuses, but they rarely exceed $1,300. The biggest bonus Jenny has received was around $1,300.

In addition to the bonuses, she sometimes received PR packages as gifts. Artists receive a lot of these packages from brands, and often pass them on to their assistants because there are just too many to use, or they simply aren't interested in them.

In the world of artist assistants, female assistants aren’t as common as one might expect. Many male artists prefer not to hire female assistants due to concerns about rumors. Additionally, entertainment companies worry that male artists might become too familiar with female assistants. Surprisingly, male artists also avoid employing fangirls as assistants for fear they might leak schedules or personal information online. Therefore, fangirls looking to apply for this job must keep their fandom under wraps because male artists typically dislike fangirls in professional roles.

Moreover, being a life assistant for an artist isn’t as glamorous as it might seem. Many artists don’t treat their assistants as equals. Jenny once saw an arrogant artist throw an item at her assistant’s head just because the assistant took too long to retrieve it. The poor girl was left in tears, earning only $400 a month without any social insurance benefits. It’s tough out there.

Jenny often sees online marketing accounts claiming that artists stay in luxury hotels and that their assistants enjoy the same perks. This is misleading. Artists aren’t fools; they’ll cover travel expenses, but instruct their assistants to book cheaper accommodations. Typically, the hotels are closer to the set but far from luxurious. While travel expenses might seem decent, they often result in a loss for the assistants.

So if you’re thinking of becoming an artist assistant, don’t harbor any fantasies about dining and living luxuriously alongside artists in five-star hotels. If you’re working with a male artist, it may be slightly better as they might eat more, but if you’re with a female artist, she might restrict her diet to maintain her figure. Eating in front of her might even provoke a strong reaction. Female artists on diets can be quite temperamental.

On top of that, the work hours for artist assistants are not as flexible as people think. The job can be incredibly unpredictable, with some days being slow while others are packed back-to-back. Shooting usually takes place from 2 PM to midnight, rarely in the morning. After a day of filming, assistants might have to rush to the airport for a new round of shooting. What do you do if there’s no time to sleep? You find a random spot on set to catch some rest. Jenny once dozed off on a large woven bag used for costumes after three consecutive days of work. She managed to snatch half an hour of sleep before the artist’s manager woke her up, giving her a stern talking-to. Her eyes were bloodshot from exhaustion. This incident is etched in her memory; she felt so aggrieved.

Jenny often regrets not pursuing a job related to her major after graduating from college. Instead, she followed her passion for stars and became an artist assistant. The hardships she endures now are just the consequences of her youthful decisions. If not for her five years wasted as an artist assistant, she wouldn’t have been forced to apply for this job at an entertainment company.

Finally, it was Jenny’s turn for the interview. Upon entering the office, she noticed a young woman with an elegant demeanor sitting behind the desk, looking quite amiable. In front of her was a round cat—so round in fact, that if it weren’t still a kitten, Jenny might have thought it was a cat expecting kittens. It was adorable, albeit a bit too plump!

“Please take a seat,” the woman said, interrupting Jenny’s thoughts about the cat.

“Thank you.” Jenny nodded and sat down opposite the desk.

As is customary for interviews, the session started with a self-introduction. While listening to Jenny’s introduction, the woman glanced at her resume. Having worked as an assistant for three popular artists in the industry over five years, Jenny seemed to have a solid background.

The woman looked up from the resume. With keen insight, she assessed Jenny’s character and noted her potential as an artist assistant rated at 9.2. Considering her experience, one would expect the three artists she worked with to want to keep her around. So why was she here interviewing with Star Entertainment?

“I see you have quite a bit of experience and strong capabilities. Why didn’t you stay with your previous artists?” the woman inquired.

Jenny thought, “What strong capabilities? All I do is fetch water and run errands.” But she maintained a serious demeanor and replied, “There were no opportunities for promotion; that was the reason I left those three artists.”

“Do you want to become a manager?” the woman asked, leaning back in her comfortable chair.

“Yes, if I have the ability, I’d like to take on that challenge,” Jenny answered.

In the entertainment industry, the real core resources and long-term development opportunities lie with the managers. Although she’s currently an artist assistant, she has to think about her career growth. Becoming a manager is her goal.

However, managers of established artists are either top-notch professionals with powerful resources who serve major stars or those who have spent years alongside artists through thick and thin. Given the fixed circles of established artists, Jenny knows she can’t become a manager for them. Thus, she can only aim to manage the newer generation of artists. But in this industry, most new artists start working at a young age and tend to bring family members along.

Setting aside the professional skills of those relatives, it takes a lot of effort and luck to outmaneuver their parents or siblings to become a manager. Moreover, working for the artists and their families sounds exhausting. With their relatives around, what good roles would be left for her?

Nonetheless, Jenny perceived that Star Entertainment is a promising company. From her observations, it seemed like a newly established entertainment company with fewer employees. They were looking for assistants for a newly formed seven-member girl group, which meant they weren't a family business. If she works hard, there might be a chance for her to become a manager.

Jenny knew that the seven-member girl group already has a manager, but eventually, they would disband and go solo, right? When that time comes, if she seizes the opportunity, she might become a manager for one of the group members.

“Hmm… as for the manager of the Beidou Girl Group, you can forget about that for now. But if your capabilities are sufficient, I can arrange for you to try managing an artist,” the woman said, gently stroking the back of her cat.

An individual's potential isn’t fixed; perhaps Jenny will gradually transition from being an assistant to managing artists as she gains experience, and her abilities might evolve from 9.2 as an assistant to above 9 as a manager.

“Uh, and you are?” Jenny asked, eyes wide in surprise.

Isn’t it the HR department that assigns managers to artists? Isn’t that usually decided by company executives and the artists themselves?

“I am Ling Xiaoxing, the manager of the Beidou Girl Group and the president of this entertainment company,” the woman replied with a smile. “As I mentioned earlier, I can only start you off as an assistant for the Beidou Girl Group. The company has a promotion pathway, and when you’re ready to take on the manager role, I’ll arrange for you to manage an artist.”

Jenny was taken aback and quickly stood up from her chair. How could the company president be conducting her interview? Were they still searching for HR?

“What do you think? Are you interested in working here with us?” Ling Xiaoxing continued.

“Yes, yes!” Jenny replied quickly.

Then, she watched as Ling Xiaoxing stood up from her chair and extended her hand, “Jenny, welcome to Star Entertainment!”

Jenny shook her hand, grateful, “Thank you! I appreciate this opportunity, and I will work hard!”

“You definitely need to work hard, and your job starts right now,” Ling Xiaoxing said with a smile. She then instructed Jenny to find the HR director, Li Xiang, who would explain the salary and benefits of being an artist assistant in detail. If Jenny was satisfied with the benefits, she could sign the employment contract with Li Xiang and start working immediately.

Jenny nodded and left the office to find Li Xiang.

Looking at the contract in front of her, Jenny felt immense satisfaction. The salary for artist assistants at Star Entertainment wasn’t exceptionally high, and there was a three-month probation period with a salary of $400 per month. After the probation, it would rise to $800, but most importantly, they offered social insurance and housing benefits!

Having been an artist assistant for so long, Jenny had never encountered a company that offered such benefits, and they didn’t even deduct the costs from her salary! This was fantastic!

She no longer had to worry about falling seriously ill and being unable to afford treatment. Her parents would be more at ease with her continuing this job.

Also, Star Entertainment even provided free accommodation for artist assistants, allowing them to live with the artists. Although this was primarily for the convenience of assisting artists, it sounded incredible!

Just as Jenny thought she had stepped into a paradise rather than an entertainment company, she heard Li Xiang, the HR director, say, “Oh, by the way, Jenny, before you start working, I need to mention that two members of the Beidou Girl Group graduated from middle school. If they have any knowledge gaps, you must help them.”

“There’s also another member who graduated from high school. Only two have university degrees, while the others are still in college.”

“I see you graduated from a pretty good university. You should be able to help correct their mistakes.”

Jenny felt her cheeks flush. After five years in the entertainment industry, she had mostly forgotten what she learned in school. She could probably only correct the artists’ typos at this point.

“Is that okay? Won’t they get mad?” Jenny asked, somewhat incredulous. She was here to be an assistant, and now she was expected to help educate the artists?

Everyone knows that among the new generation of artists, the average education level is around high school dropouts, scattered like fish out of water. Many of them gained public attention through luck and now live in a vacuum, thinking they are chosen ones. Their family members, staff, and fans constantly praise them, making it hard for them to stay grounded.

Being in such an environment, does it lead to arrogance? Jenny had served artists with inflated egos before. Initially, she was excited to be an assistant to her idol, believing it was a privilege to help him with everything from opening water bottles to delivering them personally.

Of course, those were just minor tasks. At first, she enjoyed it as a fan. However, her perspective shifted dramatically when her idol handed her his dirty laundry to wash. That was when her fan’s filter shattered completely.

She became an artist assistant to support her idol's growth, not to indulge in the menial tasks that come with it.

“Of course you can! That request comes from President Ling herself!”

In response to Jenny's concern, Li Xiang assured her, continuing, “President Ling has also mentioned hiring tutors to help them with their education.”

Li Xiang remembered Ling Xiaoxing’s words clearly. They didn’t expect them to attend university, but they wanted them to have basic cultural knowledge.

Jenny couldn’t help but admire Ling Xiaoxing. She had never seen a boss so invested in the education of their artists.
