**The Glasses of the Queen Boss**

After the interviews this morning, Stella Smith successfully hired two administrative staff members, an accountant, and two drivers with commercial licenses. Among them was Linda Johnson, a 42-year-old woman with a college degree and over a decade of experience in administration and management. Her character was rated as excellent by Stella's trusted intuition.

After passing the interview, Stella appointed Linda as the Director of Administration and Personnel, offering her a monthly salary of $30,000 with no probation period, double pay at year-end, and full benefits. She asked Linda to start working immediately, a request Linda accepted with enthusiasm.

The second administrative hire was an assistant named Chloe Davis, a 25-year-old with a bachelor's degree and two years of experience as an administrative assistant. Her character was also rated as excellent. After passing the interview, Chloe agreed to start immediately, with a three-month probation period and a salary starting at $3,000, which would increase to $5,000 upon confirmation, along with the same year-end bonus and benefits.

The accountant Stella hired was a 40-year-old named Yvonne Brown, who had a college degree and over eight years of financial experience, along with a CPA qualification. Stella appointed Yvonne as the Financial Director with a $30,000 salary, no probation period, double pay at year-end, and full benefits. Yvonne accepted the position with excitement.

Unexpectedly, Stella hired one more driver than planned. The two drivers were a married couple, Peter and Laura Green, both over 40 with more than ten years of experience driving buses. Their character levels were rated as one excellent and one good. Peter was known for his selflessness, and Laura was equally commendable. Stella hired both at a monthly salary of $8,000, with no probation, double pay at year-end, and full benefits.

Stella asked the couple to start working immediately to assist Yvonne with setting up a basic company account and tax registration.

Stella briefly explained the nature of the company and its development plans to Linda, asking her to draft a set of management rules and regulations for review.

Suddenly, Stella realized that aside from her own laptop, none of the new employees had work computers. She called her two artists, Alex Johnson and Megan Roberts, to the temporary office and specifically asked Megan to come without makeup.

Once Alex and Megan arrived, Stella turned to her administrative assistant Chloe and said, “Please sort through the artist resumes in the company email. I requested candid, unfiltered full-body shots along with paper resumes, and I’m only hiring females.”

As she spoke, Stella pointed at Alex and Megan, “Their natural looks should be comparable. The height should be between 5'5'' and 5'7'', and ages must be between 18 and 22. Experience as a trainee or any special talents is a plus. Delete any resumes that don’t meet these criteria and save the ones that do separately.”

“Got it, I’ll take care of it,” Chloe nodded.

Afterward, Stella handed her laptop to Chloe and took Linda and Laura out of the Financial District, driving towards a nearby Walmart.

Upon arriving at Walmart, Stella asked Linda to help purchase necessary office supplies. “Linda, we could go to the wholesale market; it’s cheaper there,” Linda suggested.

Stella pulled out a Walmart gift card and said, “Not for now. There’s $15,000 on this card; let’s spend it first.”

“...Alright,” Linda replied after a moment's hesitation.

Stella headed directly to the electronics section, intending to choose the best configurations and buy three computers. She turned to Linda and asked, “Which color do you prefer?”

Linda was astonished by Stella's willingness to invest in high-quality equipment but quickly responded, “Pink.”

“Okay, we’ll take one pink,” Stella said, continuing, “I wonder what Yvonne and Chloe like.”

Stella planned to equip a large printer worth over $4,500, along with other office supplies. When they reached the checkout, the $15,000 on the card wasn’t nearly enough.

**[Today’s daily task released: spend $1,500 within 30 minutes!]**

**[Random task triggered: spend $1 million within 4 hours!]**

Perfect! Stella thought. Now that the money isn’t enough, fortune has come to the rescue!

“Fortune, you rock!” Stella praised inwardly.

**[Hmm!]**

Fortune was quite pleased.

Stella exhausted the funds on the Walmart card and then paid an additional $10,000 in cash, completing the shopping spree.

Once the group had moved the supplies back to the apartment with the help of the store staff, Stella found that Yvonne had already completed the tasks she assigned.

“The basic account is set up. When can we use it?” Stella asked Yvonne.

Yvonne nodded, replying, “Stella, it can be used right now. I’ve also set up the online banking for the corporate account.”

Quick! Stella thought she’d have to wait a few more days.

With that in mind, Stella communicated with Fortune in her mind, “If I deposit the task funds into the company’s basic account as operational funds, does that count as completing the task?”

**[Yes, but once you deposit it, that money can only be used for business operations, not for personal gain.]**

“Don’t worry about that!” Stella assured.

Then, following Yvonne’s instructions, she logged onto the corporate online banking and transferred the remaining funds of $940,000 from the random task.

After completing the random task, Stella clicked to draw a prize. The pointer spun around and finally landed in the physical rewards section.

“Glasses of the Queen Boss? What’s this reward?” Stella wondered, clicking on the reward area. Information about the glasses appeared before her.

The Queen Boss’s Glasses were a specially customized physical reward for the host. Wearing these glasses would correct any vision defects and bestow a layer of boss-like aura, enhancing her personal charisma and intimidating others.

Stella claimed the reward and discreetly pulled out the Queen Boss’s glasses from her bag. The name may sound frivolous, but the glasses themselves looked quite stylish. The arms were black with gold wire frames, and the lenses were slightly oversized, capable of covering half her face.

When Stella put on the golden-framed glasses, her vision instantly became clearer. Looking towards Chloe, who was the farthest away, she could even see the small mole at the corner of her mouth.

Feeling her gaze, Chloe looked up and, startled, immediately lowered her head, fixating on her computer screen.

Did I just get caught daydreaming? 

President Smith looks so stern! What a strong aura! 

It’s tough to find a job these days! 

I don’t want to get fired after just one day! 

With that thought, Chloe hurriedly composed herself, fully concentrating on her resume screening.

Stella was puzzled; Chloe clearly looked frightened. She turned her attention to Linda, who, upon noticing her gaze, glanced over quickly and then lowered her head to continue her work.

Stella couldn’t help but sigh. Even though the newly appointed Director of Administration and Personnel appeared calm, Stella was sure that Linda was also intimidated by her current appearance.

She took out a compact mirror to check her reflection and then snapped the mirror shut in a hurry.

In a daze, she momentarily saw the face of her high school principal.

Stella recalled the sound of high heels tapping on the hallway floor, echoing like a beating drum in her tense heart. She remembered the sharp gaze from the small window in the classroom’s back door, a look of concern from the principal.

Feeling mischievous, Stella stepped out of the apartment and headed towards the one where Alex and Megan were staying.

She took out her apartment key, quietly opened the door, and tiptoed inside.

In the living room, Alex and Megan were sitting side by side on the sofa, watching a video on their phones, giggling and chatting.

“Cough!” 

Stella intentionally cleared her throat, wanting to grab their attention.

As she hoped, Alex and Megan turned their heads.

Only Alex was startled, nearly dropping his phone. Jumping off the sofa, he nervously told Stella, “President Smith, I’ll go practice dancing right away!”

“No need to be nervous; I just wanted to check how you two were getting along,” Stella said, suppressing her laughter.

To help Alex relax, Stella took off her glasses and continued, “It’s noon now; what do you want for lunch?”

Seeing Stella’s warm demeanor return without the glasses, Alex visibly relaxed and said, “Anything’s fine.”

Megan, however, seemed a bit disappointed but didn’t forget about lunch, replying, “As long as it’s not too spicy; I can’t eat spicy food.”

Approaching Stella, Megan quietly asked, “President Smith, can I borrow your glasses for a moment?”

“Of course.”

Stella replied, handing the glasses to Megan.

Once Megan put on the glasses, she turned to the other two with excitement, saying, “So, how do I look? Do I seem cool?”

“Hmm… like a student,” Alex honestly remarked.

The Queen Boss’s glasses were a custom reward for Stella as a system host; others wearing them wouldn’t receive the boss-like aura, making it no different from a regular pair of glasses.

Thus, with the golden-framed glasses on, Megan appeared more demure and resembled a playful student trying on a teacher’s glasses, especially with her half-pink, half-black long hair clashing with the look.

Upon hearing Alex’s comment, Megan rushed to the bathroom to check her reflection. After a while, she returned looking dejected, taking off the glasses and returning them to Stella.

Stella smiled as she accepted the glasses and put them back on, instantly boosting her aura impressively.

Stella’s striking appearance left Megan starry-eyed, while Alex felt the urge to escape the apartment.

On graduation day, Stella took an early flight to New York City.

Upon arriving at her dorm, she found her roommates, except for Emily, were already there.

Seeing Stella, Jessica joyfully approached her.

“Stella, long time no see!”

After greeting her, Jessica pointed at the clothing on Stella's desk, saying, “I’ve picked up your graduation robe; hurry and change! The counselor notified us to participate in the graduation ceremony at 9 AM, take photos at 11, and then have a farewell meal at Central Park.”

“Thank you,” Stella smiled in gratitude.

“Stella, you look so beautiful after not seeing you for a long time!”

Lily exclaimed upon seeing her roommate after three months.

She couldn’t pinpoint what exactly made Stella look better; it was just that her aura was astonishing, and her skin radiated brightness.

“Thanks, you look stunning too.”

After complimenting Lily, Stella also noticed her friend had changed significantly; her new hairstyle and makeup made her even more beautiful than before.

“Hehe, I think so too,” Lily beamed, cupping her face with her hands.

In the next moment, Jessica elbowed Lily in the lower back.

“Aren’t you embarrassed?”

“You’re the one who’s not embarrassed!”

The two laughed and began playfully chasing each other around the dorm.

Stella chuckled while putting on her graduation robe.

She touched the smooth fabric, reflecting on the moment.

Today was her graduation day.

Once dressed in her graduation robe, the three of them stepped out of the dorm.

Since there was still some time before the ceremony, they began taking photos around the campus.

Stella felt regretful, wondering why she hadn’t thought of buying a camera!

Oh well, her phone’s camera quality isn’t bad.

Today marked the graduation ceremony at New York University, and countless students were capturing memories around the campus, much like Stella and her friends.

Just as they were enjoying themselves, one person’s appearance shattered the joy, causing all three of them to frown.

The public enemy of their dorm, Emily, was striding towards them.
