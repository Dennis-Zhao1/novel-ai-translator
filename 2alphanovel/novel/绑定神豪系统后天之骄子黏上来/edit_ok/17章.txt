**Jewels**

Stella Grant woke up just before eight in the evening.

When she opened her eyes, Ethan Miller had already left the room.

She tried to move her legs a bit and found that the pain had lessened. Taking her time, she slowly got out of bed.

As her feet touched the floor, she felt a dull ache in her calves, but it was manageable.

Stella tiptoed towards the bathroom in her hospital room, intending to take care of her immediate needs before confronting her inner voice about what had happened.

"Voice, why did you knock me out?" Stella was furious; this was not how you help someone! At the very least, you could notify them first, ask for their opinion, and give them time to prepare!

Realizing it had messed up, the voice quickly admitted its fault. "I'm sorry..."

As long as the voice acknowledged its mistake, Stella didn't want to dwell on it. She sighed and said, "Just don't do that again next time. At least ask for my opinion first."

"Got it, got it!" the voice replied.

"By the way, did Ethan get scared when I fainted? When did he leave?" Stella inquired as she started organizing her belongings in the hospital room.

"No! He thought you were asleep, and to avoid disturbing you, he left right away!" The voice quickly fabricated a lie it had rehearsed countless times in its mind, not daring to mention that Ethan had sneakily kissed her and taken photos of her asleep with his phone.

"That's good." Stella breathed a sigh of relief. She honestly didn't know how to interact with Ethan. Once she paid off her debts, they wouldn't have to see each other again.

After gathering her things, Stella tried walking a few steps in her usual manner. She found that the pain in her legs didn’t really affect her walking, just made her a little limp, so she left the hospital room.

Stella hobbled to the hospital’s payment counter to settle her bill, asking how much her hospitalization and treatment had cost in total. Ethan had already covered all her expenses at the hospital, but Stella wanted to know the exact amount so she could repay him.

"The total for hospitalization and treatment is 5,300 dollars," the staff at the payment counter replied.

Even with mental preparation, Stella couldn’t help but gasp in shock at the amount. Adding in the imported fruits that had a price tag of 1,700 dollars, that brought the total to 7,000 dollars! Ethan spent that much on fruits alone; Stella estimated that the meal she had today probably cost at least 1,000 dollars.

That meant she would need to repay him about 8,000 dollars!

Stella left the hospital feeling utterly despondent.

She knew Ethan meant well by arranging for her to be in a single room and buying her expensive fruits and meals, but they were so costly!

She only had a little over 10,000 dollars in savings, and if she paid off this 8,000 dollars debt, she certainly wouldn’t have enough left for rent!

Did that mean she would have to leave New York and find a city with cheaper rent to start anew?

"Stella, don't worry! I'll send you money tomorrow, and you'll be able to pay off your debts right away!" The voice, seeing her frown, hurried to comfort her.

"Really? Can the task funds be used to pay off debts instead of buying things?" Stella asked, hardly believing it.

"That's not how it works. The task funds can only be used to purchase valuable items, not to pay debts. But I have a way to help you make money, just wait and see!" The voice assured her confidently.

"Thank you, voice! I love you!" Stella felt a rush of happiness that made her want to jump up, but she restrained herself, remembering the subtle ache in her calves from the cramps.

Once she returned to her apartment, she was definitely going to give her little money-making voice a good scratch from head to toe!

……

After returning home in the afternoon, Ethan occasionally glanced at his phone screen while lying in bed.

Before leaving the hospital, Ethan had deliberately sent Stella a message on his phone.

He told her that if she woke up, she must call him so he could come back to the hospital to take care of her.

Just after eight in the evening, Ethan, having not received a call from Stella, instead received a call from the hospital.

Since the hospital was very close to the university, Stella, feeling a rare luxury, planned to take a taxi back to campus.

As soon as Stella settled into the back seat of the taxi, her phone rang.

She stared at the screen in frustration, hesitating for a few seconds. Finally, she made up her mind and hung up Ethan’s call, deciding to communicate with him via a text message instead.

"Thank you for taking care of me today. My leg is feeling much better now. I'm back at the dorm and getting ready to sleep, so you don't have to come back to the hospital."

After hanging up, Ethan was left in a state of panic.

He worried about whether Stella had encountered trouble on her way back to school at night, perhaps even lost her phone.

Fortunately, that wasn't the case!

After reading Stella's message several times to confirm it was indeed from her, he finally felt relieved. But why couldn’t they just talk on the phone? Stella had just woken up, and she was already planning to go to sleep once back at school?

Ethan wanted to send her another message, asking why she didn’t stay in the hospital a bit longer, but he hesitated, fearing he would disturb her.

Holding his phone, Ethan threw himself onto the bed, rolling from one end to the other repeatedly, frustrated enough to throw his phone onto the bedside table.

Before long, he reached for his phone again and sent two messages in quick succession.

"Alright, let's talk tomorrow."

"Goodnight, Stella~"

Stella couldn't help but smile at the cute rabbit emoji Ethan sent her for a goodnight message. Her zodiac sign was indeed a rabbit, and that emoji was quite adorable.

Tomorrow, they would chat again…

By then, she would directly transfer the money to repay him.

After all, her dear voice wouldn’t let her run out of money.

The next morning, Stella woke up and the first thing she did was transfer 8,000 dollars to Ethan via a payment app, along with a message.

"I'm not sure how much the meal cost yesterday. If this isn't enough, let me know how much it is, and I'll make up the difference right away."

……

Thanks to the medicinal effects of the herbal dishes, Ethan had been feeling hot all night and had vivid dreams.

In his dream, the leading lady was, of course, his beloved Stella.

Recalling the scenes from his dream made Ethan feel hot and dry, with an itchy nose.

To ease this discomfort, he decided to take a cold shower.

Just as he stepped out of the bathroom, Ethan saw that Stella had sent him a message.

Excited, he opened his app, only to find that Stella hadn’t sent him a sweet good morning greeting but rather a payment and a cold message about repayment.

Ethan felt as if he had just undergone an ice bucket challenge, feeling colder from head to toe than when he had just taken a cold shower!

Even he couldn't be so oblivious; Stella was clearly trying to sever ties.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have rushed to repay him the very next day.

After pondering for a moment, Ethan sent her a voice message.

"The meal cost was indeed more than expected. I ordered the herbal dishes from a nice restaurant yesterday."

"How about we meet at the restaurant for lunch? We can discuss the payment in person."

A few minutes later, Stella sent another message.

"Just tell me how much the meal cost, and I'll pay you right away. No need to meet up."

Ethan couldn’t help but chuckle in disbelief at her message but felt helpless. He replied, "If you don’t meet me, I won’t tell you how much it was. You can just owe me forever."

"Then you should accept the payment first. Once you do, we can discuss meeting up." Stella replied quickly.

In order to set up a meeting, Ethan had no choice but to accept the payment.

Afterward, they began discussing the details of their meeting. Stella refused to let Ethan drive over to pick her up.

Ethan stared at the phone screen, frustrated, before sending her the address of the restaurant along with the meeting time.

Receiving the address, Stella stepped out of her dorm and headed straight for the restaurant.

The agreed meeting time with Ethan was still three hours away, but Stella planned to arrive early to complete the tasks assigned by her voice nearby.

She had a strong feeling that the amount for the tasks released by the voice today would be substantial.

There weren’t many good shopping places around the campus.

If she explored some new areas today, she could identify potential shopping spots in advance, which might help her complete her tasks better.

Stella knew that her behavior might seem a bit like cheating.

But the voice had been lenient with her; it hadn’t released today’s daily task until now.

After sitting on the subway for half an hour and walking over twenty minutes, Stella finally spotted the restaurant on a bustling street.

Staring up at the 65-story, luxurious high-rise building, Stella found herself momentarily stunned.

She pulled out her phone to search for information about the restaurant and discovered that the average daily cost per person was around 5,000 dollars, which included accommodation.

If only considering the meals, it should be half that price.

So, her previous assumption about the meal cost was indeed conservative; 1,000 dollars was not enough.

Stella sighed inwardly at the extravagant life of the wealthy, then began to search for her targets around the restaurant.

After a brief exploration, she noticed a jewelry store located just a short distance to the front left of the hotel and a large supermarket to the back right.

Where she would go next depended on how much the voice had allocated for today’s tasks.

【The voice is here to announce today’s tasks! Spend 1,000 dollars within 10 minutes!】

【Ding! Today, the host has also triggered a random task: Spend 100,000 dollars within 30 minutes!】

100,000 dollars!

Stella’s eyes widened in disbelief; today’s task amount was indeed substantial!

Looking at the deposit notification on her phone, she dashed straight to the jewelry store she had just spotted.

Upon entering the jewelry store, Stella asked boldly, "Do you have any jewelry for 1,000 dollars?"

The two closest staff members were visibly taken aback by her question.

Then, one of the younger staff, named Kelly, approached her with a smile, saying, "Yes, please follow me."

Having struggled on the poverty line her whole life, Stella had never dealt with jewelry before. She only knew it was expensive and thought it would be out of her reach for life.

But what girl doesn’t like shiny jewelry?

So when Stella saw a row of uniquely shaped, sparkling diamond studs presented before her, she immediately fell in love with them, even though she didn’t have her ears pierced.

"All of these diamond studs are priced at 1,000 dollars each. You can choose whichever style you like," Kelly introduced.

Stella quickly spotted a star-shaped stud among them.

The stud was made of 18k platinum, with a silver five-pointed star the size of a pea, adorned with tiny white diamonds smaller than sesame seeds.

"I’ll take this one, and I want to pay right now." Stella pulled out her bank card.

Kelly was surprised by Stella's decisiveness; she had thought the girl would take more time to choose.

Kelly swiftly packaged the diamond stud for Stella and helped her process the payment.

The entire process took no more than five minutes.

【Congratulations, Stella! You have successfully completed today’s daily task!】

【You still have a random task pending. Go on and spend that 100,000 dollars!】

"Alright!" Stella suddenly exclaimed, startling Kelly, who was just handing back her bank card.

Kelly assumed Stella was complimenting her and smiled back, saying, "Thank you!"

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Stella could only smile in response.

At that moment in the jewelry store, a harmonious scene was unfolding between the customers and the staff.

However, from the viewpoint of Jane, another staff member standing nearby, the scene wasn’t as pleasant; in fact, she was laughing internally.

Just a girl trying to keep up appearances, utterly unworthy of her service.

Jane had deliberately lagged behind, recognizing instantly that Stella was a poor college student who wouldn’t provide her the commission she desired.

Sure enough, she headed straight for the 1,000 dollar section, where there was barely any commission to gain.

Let Kelly serve this student girl; it would be a good exercise in discerning high and low-end customers.

Little did she know, right after Jane finished her internal mockery, she heard Stella asking, "Do you have any jewelry priced at 100,000 dollars? Please show me some; I’d like to buy."

Kelly was momentarily stunned but quickly regained her composure and went to get the jewelry as requested.

Having worked as a sales associate in the jewelry industry for three years, Kelly had developed a keen sense for gauging customers.

She had already guessed that Stella didn’t have much money and wouldn’t be able to afford the high-priced jewelry.

But with how slow business had been in the store lately, she didn’t mind showing the expensive pieces to a customer, even if they didn’t buy anything.

It would just be good practice and a way to stretch her legs.

Seeing Kelly genuinely heading to fetch jewelry priced at 100,000 dollars, Jane quickly approached her side, whispering, "Are you really going to show her that?"

"It's fine to let the customer see a few things," Kelly smiled back.

After saying that, Kelly ignored her colleague and walked toward Stella with the selected pieces of jewelry.

She had picked three pieces, each priced at 100,000 dollars.

The first was a 2.7-carat flower-shaped untreated red ruby earring.

The second was a 5.55-carat sapphire pendant.

The third was a 3-carat oval emerald ring.

As Stella looked at the dazzling jewelry displayed before her, she thought they were all beautiful and wanted them all.

But with only the 100,000 dollar task budget, she decided to choose the piece that looked the biggest, the 5.55-carat sapphire pendant.

"I'll take this one; please wrap it up for me. I’ll pay by card." Stella pointed at the sapphire pendant as she spoke to Kelly.

Kelly was genuinely astonished this time.

She had never encountered such an extravagant customer before.

It wasn’t that the jewelry Stella bought was overly expensive.

Their store had pieces starting in the millions, and some treasures worth tens of millions.

Rather, it was Kelly’s first experience where a customer was so eager to pay for jewelry without needing a product introduction.

Even after Stella left the jewelry store, Kelly was still in disbelief.

Her colleagues gathered around to discuss what had just happened.

"She really bought it! I thought she was just browsing!"

"Who would’ve thought this girl would be so wealthy? She just casually spent 100,000 dollars!"

"Your insight is impressive, Kelly. You spotted a hidden gem!"

At that moment, Jane also stepped forward, her tone dripping with envy.

She was regretting missing out; a 100,000 dollar sale would have netted her a commission of 4,000 dollars!

Who could have predicted that a student dressed in clothes that didn’t look like they cost more than 200 dollars could afford such expensive jewelry!

Previously, she had mocked Kelly in her heart, only to realize that the real fool was herself!
