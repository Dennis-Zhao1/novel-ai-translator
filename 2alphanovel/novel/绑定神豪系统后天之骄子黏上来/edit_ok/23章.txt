**Tenfold Cashback Card for Live Streaming Gifts**

**[Congratulations, Stella, on completing your daily and weekly tasks!]**

**[Completing the weekly task grants you a chance to draw a reward from the system. Would you like to draw it now?]**

"Not yet, let's wait until we finish our meal," Stella replied, holding a bunch of fragrant shopping bags from her favorite store.

Once back in her apartment, Stella handled the shopping bags with care. After all, they contained items worth a small fortune! She needed to treat this with the utmost seriousness.

Gently, she pulled out each expensive piece of clothing from the bags, hanging them on hangers before placing them neatly in her closet. Meanwhile, the system’s little cat avatar was circling around her feet, much like a typical house cat waiting for its owner to pour out its food.

"Just a little longer! Once I finish organizing my shoes, we can eat," she reassured the little creature.

After enjoying a hearty meal, an idea struck Stella. She decided she would get a membership card at the restaurant tomorrow. By loading a substantial amount onto the card, she’d easily complete her daily task as well.

With this in mind, Stella turned to the system, "I want to draw my reward."

In an instant, a circular wheel divided into twelve sections appeared before her eyes. The wheel featured six random cash rewards, five tangible items, and one random skill reward.

Stella focused on one of the tangible items, puzzled. What exactly was a tenfold cashback card for live streaming gifts?

"System, what is this tangible reward?" Stella inquired, curious.

She understood what live streaming was and was familiar with the concept of gifting, but the combination of these terms along with “tenfold cashback” left her baffled. Before entering college, she had barely touched a smartphone. During her college years, in pursuit of a good job and mastering the language skills necessary for her career, she had devoted herself entirely to studying and tutoring.

She had lived like a hermit, with no time to waste on phones or computers, choosing instead to focus on self-improvement. Even terms like live streaming and gifting were things she had learned from the overwhelming advertisements online and from conversations with classmates.

"The tenfold cashback card for live streaming gifts means that when you gift a streamer, whatever amount you give, you will receive ten times that amount back into your bank account," the system explained while tidying up the clean meal boxes it had licked.

Stella’s eyes lit up. So, if she gifted someone a significant amount, she would get back ten times that! This tangible reward was indeed intriguing! But she worried she might not be lucky enough to draw it...

No point in overthinking it; she should just go ahead and draw.

With that thought, Stella clicked to draw her reward. The pointer spun wildly before finally landing perfectly on the section labeled “Tenfold Cashback Card for Live Streaming Gifts.”

Stella shot a skeptical look at the little cat busy at her desk. Did the system know she planned to get that membership card tomorrow and decided to reward her with this?

Regardless, it was fantastic to win a reward she actually wanted!

Quickly, Stella claimed her prize, and the details about the tenfold cashback card flooded into her mind. To her surprise, this card wasn’t a one-time use but neither was it permanent. The tenfold cashback card was valid for one hour. During this time, any gifts she made to streamers would be returned in tenfold amounts.

However, once the hour was up, the cashback effect would vanish.

Stella realized she had been careless. She should have downloaded the live streaming app and registered before claiming the reward! Thirty seconds had already passed!

Panicking, she hurriedly opened the app store on her phone and downloaded the popular streaming app her classmates often mentioned.

After registering and binding her identity and bank information, Stella eagerly searched for the “live” section within the app.

Finally, she clicked into a live stream and was greeted by a beautiful young woman singing directly to the camera.

"You smell like her perfume~ it’s all in my nose…”

The singing was pleasant, and the young woman was indeed pretty, but Stella wasn’t interested. She clicked on the upper right corner for more streams.

A neatly arranged list of live streams filled her screen. Stella entered a few rooms, seeing a mix of male and female streamers singing, dancing, showcasing their talents, and even older hosts sharing their life experiences or selling products.

As for the gaming streams, Stella brushed them aside; she had never played games and didn’t understand them at all.

Glancing at the virtual timer floating above, she noticed fifteen minutes had already passed, and she still hadn’t found a streamer worth gifting.

Stella could have easily gifted the first streamer she encountered, maximizing her potential earnings, but she didn't want to do that. She didn’t believe those streamers looked like they were in need of money. Having faced hardship herself, she didn’t want to waste her gift on someone who seemed well-off.

Why did she end up with a tenfold cashback card for live streaming gifts instead of a charity donation card? Wasn’t it unfair to have to sift through so many streams to find someone truly in need?

Then an idea struck her. She quickly typed “illness” into the search bar of the live streaming platform.

After finding a relevant stream, she rushed into a room called “Mom Anning,” where the title read, “Baby Anbao is Sick.”

It was evident that this streamer needed help! Upon entering the stream, Stella saw a weary middle-aged woman walking through the hospital corridor, holding a medical record in her hands, talking to viewers about her day.

She shared details about her children’s health struggles, mentioning how they had been diagnosed with a serious condition. Stella felt her heart sink; she needed to find out exactly how much money was needed for their treatment.

Stella focused on the task at hand, determined to help.
