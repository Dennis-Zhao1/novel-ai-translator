**Wealthy Watch Enthusiast**

Stella Jones had always trusted the promise of the Celestial Fortune System.

"So, do they know how much money I have in my account now?" Stella asked, leaning back in her chair.

"Ethan probably does, but the guy named Zack hasn't dug that deep; he only checked your transaction history," Celestial Fortune replied, casually sipping his coffee.

Hearing this, Stella's mood soured. Her opinion of Ethan was dropping fast, almost on par with her disdain for Luke. She hadn’t expected Zack to uncover her identity so quickly. Still, given his obsessive nature, she wasn't entirely surprised. This was a man who would go to great lengths, even if it meant risking everything.

For now, Stella didn’t want to dwell on Zack's behavior. But why was Ethan investigating her? Was it because he liked her? Could someone be so infatuated that they'd snoop around a bank account?

Stella felt annoyed but reasoned it was due to her extraordinary luck. These people weren’t acting normally, and as long as they left her money untouched, she decided it wasn't worth making a fuss.

The following day, Stella visited a local bank to apply for a new card. She transferred all her money to this new account, upgrading it to a platinum card for tighter security. Once her assets exceeded a hundred million and her business ventures flourished, she could upgrade to a diamond card after a bank evaluation. With Celestial Fortune by her side, Stella was confident that day wasn't far off.

It was Friday, and the recent Memorial Day weekend had marked a pivotal phase in her collaboration with Global Trade Corp. Her company had worked tirelessly through the holiday, and it was only yesterday they compensated the team for their hard work with an advance on their salaries and overtime pay.

Stella planned to use her time off to scout for fresh talent in the entertainment industry near the bustling areas of downtown. She knew she'd have to return to this area in the evening, just like she had before, to continue her search. Yet, the thought that someone might be lurking near her apartment made her uneasy.

Thankfully, whenever she was home with Celestial Fortune, they'd always draw the curtains, ensuring her privacy. Celestial Fortune assured her that even without them, he could use high-tech virtual imagery to conceal her apartment's reality from prying eyes.

Reassured, Stella began to wander around the lively city streets. The area was filled with fashionable young people, but she couldn’t tell if they were aspiring entertainers or just out for a good time. She hesitated to use her Insightful Eye ability, as it was limited to an hour each day, and she didn’t want to waste it.

After a while, with no promising talent in sight, she remembered that since she had decided to recruit Jessica into her girl group, the other members couldn’t be any less appealing. They had to be of equal or greater charisma, and she wasn’t settling for potential below a nine.

**Ding! Today’s daily task: Spend $1,500 within 30 minutes!**

**Ding! Random task triggered: Spend $750,000 within 2 hours!**

"Stella, I'm so annoyed! There are too many people, and I don't want to keep looking for handsome guys near you! Let's hide in a store and rest for a bit," Celestial Fortune whined.

Stella sighed internally. It was clear Celestial Fortune was trying to slack off again. But with so many tasks requiring spending, the nearest shopping center was the upscale district. Wouldn’t that place be even more crowded?

Reluctantly, Stella turned towards the shopping area, despite Celestial Fortune's complaints. Once inside, she noticed several luxury brand stores.

Since Celestial Fortune's random tasks were getting costlier, Stella had researched luxury brands for future reference. Today, she was just scouting for talent and didn’t plan to buy anything too cumbersome.

After contemplating various luxury stores, she finally entered a high-end watch boutique. Honestly, Stella felt she didn’t really need a watch; she could simply check the time on her phone. But she had heard the saying: the poor play with cars, and the rich play with watches. As someone about to become an entertainment mogul, she felt a watch was a fitting status symbol.

Inside, Stella approached the closest salesperson and said, "I'd like to see some women's watches priced around $150,000."

If she was buying a watch, it had to be something collectible. The salesperson quickly presented two stunning pieces for her to choose from.

The first was the ÉGÉRIE Moonphase from the Goddess series, crafted in 18K white gold adorned with diamonds. The moon phase display was positioned elegantly, exuding enchanting charm. The price was $200,000.

The second was from the Tradition series, featuring an intricate movement and adorned with numerous diamonds, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship. This watch was priced at $250,000.

Stella found both watches captivating and decided to purchase them both. After completing the payment, she received a notification that her daily task was complete. She immediately put on the adjusted ÉGÉRIE Moonphase watch and carried the shopping bag containing the other as she left the store.

With $350,000 remaining, Stella pondered for a moment before heading into a jewelry store, BVLGARI. Inside, apart from her, there were four stunning young women in their twenties selecting accessories.

To be precise, only one girl was choosing jewelry, while the others were simply accompanying her.

"Lily, your boyfriend is so generous; he gives you spending money for jewelry every month!" one of the girls said enviously.

"Of course! He really likes me, so he spoils me," Lily said proudly, enjoying the attention.

She tried on a white gold bracelet, admiring it, and said, "You should all come with me to the party tonight. I guarantee you'll find boyfriends who treat you like mine does."

Hearing this, the girl with the bleached hair hesitated, but she and another girl nodded, thanking Lily for the opportunity.

"What about you, Megan? Why so quiet?" Lily asked, turning to the girl with half-black, half-pink hair.

Megan blinked her big eyes, adorned with smoky eye makeup, and quietly replied, "I need to think about it."

"What's there to think about? Do you want to stay stuck in a dead-end job or move up in the world?" Lily scoffed at her.

Trainee!

Catching the term, Stella paused as she approached the jewelry display case and turned to observe the four girls. Aside from the half-pink-haired girl, who wore heavy makeup, the others looked quite appealing. However, recalling their earlier conversation, Stella instantly lost interest.

She didn’t want anyone with a questionable past in her girl group. Parties, bars—so these four were just looking to cozy up to wealthy men tonight.

"Just give me a little more time to think about it," Megan murmured.

"Humph." Lily snorted lightly, turning back to continue picking out accessories, saying, "You better decide before I'm done shopping; I'm only giving you this one chance."

Megan's eyes flashed with struggle as she hesitated for a moment before whispering, "I'll think about it some more."

Lily instantly lost interest in selecting jewelry upon hearing Megan's response.

She was so captivating when singing, yet outside of the mic, she couldn’t muster a coherent thought.

Thinking about how her boyfriend had frequently inquired about Megan’s absence from parties, Lily felt even more annoyed.

What was the point of picking anything? Her boyfriend had just given her $5,000; what could she possibly buy here!

Just as Lily was about to notify Megan that her time to decide was up, she suddenly heard a soft female voice say, "Please show me a piece of jewelry priced around $350,000."

Stella scanned the jewelry around her and noticed that certain designs were quite common, so she added, "I’m not interested in anything overly flashy."

The jewelry salesperson smiled and replied, "Certainly, please wait a moment."

Before leaving, the salesperson noticed Stella’s watch and the shopping bag she was carrying and suggested, "Ma’am, we have a $350,000 emerald jewelry watch. Would you like to take a look?"

"Sure," Stella nodded. It wouldn’t hurt to buy another watch; she could wear it on different occasions.

Lily thought to herself, "What a wealthy girl!"

Shortly after, the jewelry salesperson brought over the $350,000 emerald jewelry watch.

"Ma’am, this BVLGARI DIVA emerald luxury watch won the ‘Best Jewelry Watch’ award and is inspired by classical aesthetic forms, reflecting the mosaic patterns of ancient Roman tile art," the salesperson explained.

As the salesperson helped Stella put the emerald watch on her right wrist, she continued, "This watch’s case and bracelet are made of 18K white gold, set with a myriad of diamonds and emeralds, showcasing extraordinary artistry."

The design was elegant and captivating, and Stella was immediately taken with it. "Can I purchase it for $350,000?"

"Absolutely, I'll wrap it up for you now," the salesperson nodded.

"No need; I’ll just wear it out," Stella replied, taking off the moonphase watch from her left wrist and putting on the emerald jewelry watch instead.

It wasn’t just Stella who loved the watch; everyone who saw it was captivated by its luxurious and elegant appearance.

Lily felt a pang of jealousy. She couldn’t even afford a $5,000 bracelet yet had to watch a girl who looked better than her flaunt a $350,000 jewelry watch.

The disparity between people was just too vast!

“That watch is stunning!” the girl with the bun exclaimed.

“What does that matter? As long as you come with me to tonight’s party and find a caring boyfriend, you could wear a watch like that without spending your own money!” Lily said, enviously and jealously, causing the jewelry salesperson assisting Stella to roll her eyes at her.

How shameless!

Did this woman not realize her loud voice made it clear to everyone in the store about her experiences of cozying up to wealthy men?

The salesperson inwardly lamented the decline of societal values.

Stella glanced back at the four girls, particularly at the one who had just made that shameless remark, now standing awkwardly behind the others.

For some reason, Stella recalled what her friend had once told her: “In their lives, no one talks to them about knowledge or insights; they only discuss resources and connections. Very few genuinely focus on learning what a trainee should learn.”

“Each person came to this city with dreams, wanting to strive for something.”

“And now, when I talk to them about ideals, they think I'm a fool.”

Stella didn’t want to be the fool, so she decided against lecturing them.
