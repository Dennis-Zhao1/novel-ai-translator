**Only the Unique is Truly Universal**

Stella Brooks felt a surge of energy as she navigated the bustling streets.

But when she spotted the girl with a 9.6 rating, it was as if an icy bucket of water had been dumped over her head.

The girl was someone Stella recognized—the one with striking half-pink, half-black hair and bold eye makeup she'd seen earlier at a jewelry store downtown.

“...I’m okay,” Stella gasped, trying to regain her footing.

“Good to hear,” the girl replied, her name being Melody Summers. She gave Stella a small nod, her impressive 9.6 rating displayed above her head, and began to walk away.

“Hold on a second!” Stella called out, her legs feeling like jelly as she moved toward Melody.

A 9.6! A score that was 0.3 points higher than Emily Johnson’s!

Even if she risked looking foolish, Stella felt she had to seize the moment. After all, life was about taking chances.

The girl before her was young, with a future full of promise.

“I think we met earlier today at the jewelry store, right?” Stella said, hope shining in her eyes as she caught up to Melody.

“Yeah, I remember you,” Melody nodded. She recalled Stella buying that emerald jewelry watch, marveling at how easily some people could spend over two million dollars.

Feeling a bit reserved, Melody added, “I’ve got to go, so… bye!”

“Wait just a moment!” Stella insisted again.

Not knowing when they might meet again, Stella felt it was crucial to keep the conversation going. She quickly stated her purpose, “You’re a trainee, right? I’m Stella Brooks, president of Starshine Entertainment. We’re forming a new girl group, aiming to create a C-POP sensation that can surpass the top stars. Interested?”

“If you’re already signed with someone else, we can cover your exit fee. It’s on us, no strings attached.”

Melody paused, intrigued by Stella’s offer, and turned back, “I’m Melody Summers. My exit fee is 1.5 million.”

Stella waved her hand dismissively, “Money’s not an issue. If you’re interested in joining us, we’ll handle it.”

Melody frowned slightly, asking, “Why me? Why do you think I’m worth covering 1.5 million?”

Stella wanted to use her usual line, the one that had worked on Emily Johnson, about having watched her for a while. But it wouldn’t make sense here since she hadn’t approached her at the store.

“Because you caught my eye, and your image is impressive,” Stella improvised. She glanced at the 9.6 rating over Melody’s head and added, “I believe you have great potential in singing.”

“You’ve heard me sing?” Melody asked, curious.

“No, but I bet you sing beautifully. Your unique voice suggests talent,” Stella continued, making it up as she went.

Melody couldn’t help but chuckle at the misunderstanding, explaining, “I just got over a cold, and my voice isn’t back to normal. This isn’t my real voice.”

Stella: “…”

She had clearly flattered her in the wrong way!

After an awkward pause, Melody broke the tension, “Thanks for the offer! How about this: I’m heading to Black Whale Bar to perform. Why don’t you come along? You can see for yourself, and then decide.”

With that, she reached behind her, tapping the long wooden case slung over her shoulder.

Stella realized Melody appreciated being valued but wanted to demonstrate her real abilities before any decisions were made.

Her current company hadn’t seen her potential, labeling her as ‘too niche’ for the mainstream market. They had dropped her plans after a talent show stint didn’t go as expected.

Stella noticed the long black case on Melody’s back and guessed it might contain an instrument.

A guitar, maybe?

Stella agreed to join Melody at the bar, eager to hear her perform.

A 9.6 rating for singing! It had to be something special!

On their way to the bar, Stella took a quick detour to a pharmacy, emerging with a mask.

She had run into some well-known figures in karaoke bars before.

Who knew what surprises a bar might hold?

But after a few steps, Stella realized the mask was unnecessary and took it off.

She knew she looked ordinary enough not to attract undue attention. Those interested in her were drawn by her potential, not her looks—so why hide?

Better to be confident and open.

Melody watched Stella’s little antics with a smile.

After about eight minutes, they arrived at Black Whale Bar.

Inside, Stella was surprised.

It wasn’t the noisy nightclub she expected.

Instead, the bar was brightly lit, with tables arranged more like a cozy restaurant.

People sat at the tables, sipping drinks, nibbling snacks, and enjoying casual conversation. It was relaxed, more like a friendly gathering than a loud party.

“Find a seat wherever you like. If a server comes by, just say you’re with me, and they won’t bother you. I need to go perform now. Catch you later!” Melody instructed, heading toward the stage.

Stella watched as Melody took the stage, opening the long case to reveal an instrument Stella hadn’t seen before.

It resembled a two-stringed instrument, complete with a bow.

Melody settled on the stool, adjusted the mic, and placed the bow across the strings.

Patrons turned their attention to Melody on stage, curious about what the girl with the striking look would perform.

Someone in the crowd recognized the instrument, telling their friend, “That’s a Morin Khuur, a traditional Mongolian instrument.”

“Is she going to sing in Mongolian?”

“No idea, let’s listen.”

Hearing this, Stella’s anticipation grew. She quickly found a seat, ready to be amazed.

Melody leaned into the microphone and began to sing softly.

“Yi~wu~wa~~a~~”

Her voice was like a blend of string and wind instruments, yet she wasn’t moving the bow! The sound came from her mouth!

Stella was astonished. How could someone produce two tones at once?

“Whoa! Throat singing! And by a woman!”

“Who is she? Fantastic!”

“Goosebumps!”

So this was throat singing!

Stella was too captivated to even grab her phone; her eyes were locked on Melody. She was witnessing the incredible potential behind that 9.6 rating!

After a display of throat singing, Melody started plucking the strings, creating a rich, soulful melody.

Stella had never heard anything like it. She felt transported to wide-open plains, the fresh scent of grass in her mind.

“Damn! Makes me want to visit the plains and just soak it in!” someone exclaimed.

Melody continued, singing traditional Mongolian folk tunes, her voice and the instrument creating a mesmerizing experience.

Melody was the only Mongolian there, and while no one understood the lyrics, everyone felt it: the beauty, the emotion.

They imagined galloping across grasslands, their spirits soaring.

It was as if an ancient call had awakened their senses.

Even without understanding the words, they were in awe!

This was music at its finest!

Stella, witnessing such a performance for the first time, felt a surge of excitement and determination to recruit this 9.6 talent!

As the performance ended, the bar erupted into applause for Melody.

“Beautiful!”

“So wonderful!”

“Amazing!”

Melody bowed, opening the instrument case to put away the Morin Khuur.

“Encore!”

“Yeah, one more!”

“Please sing again!”

“No! She can’t sing anymore; her voice isn’t fully recovered!”

Suddenly, Stella, normally reserved, shouted out, nearly losing her voice.

She hurried to the stage, speaking into the microphone, “Sorry, folks! Our singer is still recovering from a cold. Her voice needs rest, so no more today. Look forward to her next show!”

Though Stella didn’t grasp what Melody sang, she could tell the performance was challenging.

Given Melody’s condition, singing more would strain her voice.

Today, no more performances.

Once Melody was fully recovered, Stella would arrange for her to perform on a grand stage!

The bar patrons, respectful of Stella’s words, didn’t push further.

“We’ll wait for next time.”

“Next time, sing more!”

“The singer’s voice is precious; it must be protected.”

Mistaking Stella for the bar owner, someone approached and asked, “Do you have more singers who perform in Mongolian?”

“Ah?” 

Stella was startled but quickly replied, “I’m not the bar owner.”

“Then…?”

The person was puzzled—why was she speaking?

“She’s not the owner; she’s my boss! I’m signed to her company!” Melody chimed in, surprising Stella.

Melody saw the joy on Stella’s face and couldn’t help but smile back.

“Oh, I see! Best of luck! Your performance was fantastic!”

“Thank you,” Melody responded warmly.

Melody’s job at the bar was to perform and enhance the atmosphere.

With her task done, she and Stella left the bar.

They headed to a nearby café, where Stella ordered a coffee for herself and a cup of hot water for Melody. She handed her a bag of herbal tea from her tote. “You should brew this. It’s good for your throat—recommended by the pharmacist. Many singers use it.”

“...Thank you!” Melody exclaimed, pleasantly surprised as she accepted the tea.

She had thought Stella went into the pharmacy for a mask, not expecting her concern for her voice.

Feeling touched, Melody was momentarily speechless.

Despite their awkward first meeting, Stella had shown kindness and consideration, inviting her to join her company and looking out for her well-being…

This reminded Melody of her first friend in the city, who had shown her kindness when she most needed it.

“Don’t mention it,” Stella replied, reaffirming her earlier proposal, “I’d still love for you to join Starshine Entertainment. Does your response in the bar mean you agree?”

“Yes.” 

Melody nodded but hesitated, “Don’t you think my style is too niche? All I have are throat singing and the Morin Khuur. My current company says I lack marketability.”

“You’re overlooking an advantage—you speak Mongolian,” Stella countered.

Melody blushed slightly, “Most Mongolians speak it; it’s not unique.”

But Stella insisted, “Why wouldn’t it be? Your company doesn’t see your potential. Only something truly unique can be universal!”

Stella hadn’t known Melody was from a minority group.

Her performance was breathtaking!

And with her vocal prowess, she could excel in any language, not just Mongolian.

In Stella’s eyes, Melody’s current company lacked vision, seeing only niche markets instead of seizing her true strengths.

Didn’t the bar’s cheers prove that?

They just didn’t know how to harness her unique talents!
