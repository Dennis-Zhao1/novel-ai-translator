**Ambition**

Someone finally emerged!

As Stella Lang spotted a group of young women exiting a nearby office building, she immediately sprang up from her seat, grabbed her purse, and dashed out of the café.

The closer she got to the group, the clearer the potential scores floating above their heads became.

"6.3, 7.2, 6.5, 7.9, 8.3!"

Her friend, Doug, was right; among the trainees practicing late into the night, there were indeed some promising talents.

But it wasn't enough.

The trainee she was looking for needed to have a potential score of at least 8.5.

Just as Stella began to feel a bit let down, a dazzling score caught her eye.

9.3!

Without hesitation, Stella bypassed the five women strolling together and jogged toward the one trailing behind.

This girl was walking slowly, her head down, and above her floated the score indicating she was a genius in the entertainment industry.

Feeling the light shift from the shadow cast in front of her, June looked up, expecting someone to start trouble.

To her surprise, it was an unfamiliar young woman blocking her way.

“...Is there something I can help you with?” June asked, glancing at the woman before her.

“Hello, I’m Stella Lang, the president of Star Entertainment. I’d love to discuss a collaboration with you if you have some time,” Stella said, her smile masking the nervousness bubbling inside her.

This was her first time approaching someone like this.

But everyone has to start somewhere.

After all, she was going to be a boss in the future; if she couldn’t even handle this, how could she manage a company?

“I... I’m already signed with a company,” June stammered.

Was she being approached by a talent scout?

No, the woman in front of her claimed to be the president of Star Entertainment.

So, she was being scouted by the owner of an entertainment company?

Stella’s smile widened as she tried to cover her anxiety, saying, “I know. I’ve been following your progress for a while. If you’re interested in joining Star Entertainment, I can help cover your termination fee and even pay it for you.”

June blinked, stunned. She really was being noticed by the president of an entertainment company!

Not only was she personally invited, but Stella was also willing to pay her termination fee!

This was something June had never dared to dream of.

Even the company she was currently signed with had only accepted her after she applied and went through layers of selection. Before that, all she encountered were scammers trying to take her training fees; no real talent scout had ever approached her.

The five girls ahead of her seemed more attractive. Why would President Lang choose her?

The other woman had just said she had been watching her for a long time.

June's heart began to race, and just as she was about to say something, she noticed the five girls who had walked ahead suddenly turning back.

Among them, the tallest and most beautiful girl, Fiona, looked at June and asked, “June, who is this? Aren’t you going to introduce us?”

Actually, Fiona had overheard their conversation and deliberately brought them back.

This year, the announcement had canceled all audition-style programs.

The large-scale audition show they had prepared for had ended before it even began, shattering the dreams of trainees ready to debut.

Fiona didn’t know how she had made it through these days; she could only find faults in others to vent her frustration and resentment.

But why?

Why was it that at such a crucial moment, the girl she always found annoying, June, was being offered a chance?

Was this woman blind? Couldn’t she see that she was far more beautiful and had better conditions than June?

And where did this Star Entertainment come from? She had never heard of it.

Could this woman be a fraud?

As Fiona was about to mock June for meeting a scammer, she noticed the young woman claiming to be the president of Star Entertainment was impeccably dressed, and any trace of her earlier sneer vanished.

Wearing designer clothes and adorned with sparkling jewelry, there was no doubt that this seemingly ordinary young woman was anything but ordinary.

This only fueled Fiona’s jealousy.

Why?

Why was June the one getting noticed?

Stella could sense the hostility radiating from the beautiful girl beside her, but it seemed to be directed not at her.

If not at her, then it must be aimed at the girl with the 9.3 score?

Indeed, exceptional people attract jealousy.

After all, if you’re not envied, you’re mediocre!

At that moment, Stella felt a twinge of delight but quickly realized this feeling was rather malicious.

Her future company’s artist was being targeted; why would she feel happy about that…

“Sorry, we’re discussing something important right now and would prefer not to be disturbed,” Stella said to the group of five girls led by Fiona. Then, she turned back to June and smiled, inviting her, “How about we find a nearby place to sit down and talk?”

With that, Stella fixed her gaze on June, not letting a single change in her expression slip by.

And she prayed internally.

Please don’t reject her! Otherwise, she would have just put on a show for nothing!

“Sure.”

Without much thought, June nodded in agreement.

This made Stella feel relieved and elated.

Feeling great, Stella took June to a nearby seafood restaurant.

On the way, Stella learned June's name and, to show familiarity, dropped her last name: “June, is it okay to eat seafood? It’s on me.”

“No, no, no, we don’t need to eat! We can just talk at the café next door!” June hurriedly waved her hands in panic.

“Well then…”

**[Ding! Today's daily mission: Spend $1,500 within 30 minutes!]**

**[Stella, I want to eat seafood!]**

Great, the finance system finally issued today's daily task.

Aside from yesterday's weekly task, the finance system had been sending her tasks every night for the last two days; she was becoming a night owl.

Stella had initially planned to respect June's wishes and discuss things at the café, but after hearing the system, she immediately changed her mind: “Let’s stick with seafood. You’ve been practicing so late; you should have something to eat. Plus, I want some too.”

“...Okay, thanks.”

Knowing Stella wanted to eat, June had no choice but to nod in agreement, a shy expression appearing on her face. “I’m really sorry for making you spend so much.”

“You don’t have to be so polite.”

With that, the two of them entered the seafood restaurant.

As soon as they walked in, Stella asked the waiter who approached them if they could get a membership card.

After learning they could, Stella immediately applied for one and topped it up with $1,500.

This operation left June wide-eyed.

She was really wealthy.

June thought to herself.

The two were led to their table by the waiter.

Stella skimmed through the menu and said to the waiter, “I’d like one four-pound king crab, one pound of shrimp, half a dozen abalone, and one pound of clams…”

Stella paused and looked at June across the table. “June, what seafood do you like?”

“I... I’m fine with anything; just order what you want,” June replied quickly, still shocked by Stella's order of a four-pound king crab.

King crab! That’s so expensive!

June had only seen it being eaten by food vloggers online; this was her first time encountering it in real life.

“Okay then, let’s add a portion of garlic oysters, a portion of garlic vermicelli scallops, a portion of pepper beef, and for vegetables, let’s have a mix of baby bok choy,” Stella continued to order.

So much!

June was taken aback. Would they even be able to finish all this?

“I’d like iced lemon tea for my drink and mango sago for dessert.”

After finishing her order, Stella handed the menu to June and smiled, “You can pick the drinks and dessert; mine is done.”

“Oh, okay.”

June hurriedly accepted the menu with both hands.

When she saw the prices of the drinks and desserts written on the menu, she gasped. The prices here were much higher than outside.

That four-pound king crab was a whopping $300!

Feeling guilty, June initially planned to say she wouldn’t have a drink or dessert, but when she saw Stella looking at her with anticipation, she feared looking stingy, so she chose the cheapest drink, the iced salted lemon tea, and the cheapest dessert, herbal jelly, but it didn’t save much.

June thought this would be the end, but then she heard Stella tell the waiter, “I’d like another portion of everything I just ordered to go, for the drinks…”

**[I want hand-pulled milk tea and fruit ice cream for dessert!]**

The finance system chimed in her mind.

“...For the drink, I’ll have hand-pulled milk tea and for dessert, fruit ice cream. Please make this second order when we’re almost done eating.”

“Okay, just a moment please.”

After the waiter noted down the orders, she left.

Before long, the waiter pushed a cart with their ordered dishes, all raw and fresh, over to their table.

June stared in astonishment at the king crab that was as big as a basin, which the waiter deftly placed in the steaming pot in the center of the table.

Because the king crab was alive, it tried to escape several times during the process, only to be swiftly suppressed by the waiter, who was busy placing other seafood, and finally, all of them were covered by the pot lid together, heading to their fate.

As the rich aroma of seafood filled the air, June felt increasingly nervous.

Why weren’t they talking?

Hadn’t Stella said she wanted to scout her?

On June's side, her heart was racing; on the other side, Stella was wondering when the king crab would be ready to eat.

This was her first time having king crab.

The last time Stella treated her colleagues to a fancy meal, there had been seafood, but she had taken the leftover wagyu, so she hadn’t tasted the crab legs in the seafood dish.

Having missed out once, she often thought about it.

But every meal, she forgot about it.

Finally, today, she was about to get a taste.

Twenty minutes later, the seafood was ready.

The waiter approached, reminding the guests to step back to avoid being burned by the steam, and without fear of the heat, she opened the pot lid.

A cloud of hot steam rushed out, bringing with it the overpowering fragrance of seafood.

The waiter used sharp scissors to deftly dismantle the now-red king crab, quickly breaking it down into pieces.

When Stella saw the waiter handing her a crab leg that had been expertly processed, she thanked the waiter and passed it to June’s plate.

June quickly expressed her gratitude, and when Stella also had a crab leg and popped the meat into her mouth, she finally felt at ease and began to enjoy her meal.

So fresh and sweet!

June marveled. No wonder it was so expensive!

After devouring two king crab legs, satisfied, Stella returned to the previous topic.

“June, have you thought about it? Do you have any thoughts on switching companies?”

Stella continued, “You can take your time to think it over.”

“I don’t want to deceive you; actually, I haven’t registered the company yet. Star Entertainment hasn’t started up, and I haven’t decided where to set it up yet.”

“But I can assure you that I will have everything sorted out within a month.”

“Let’s exchange contact information. If you’re willing to join my company then, I will gladly pay the termination fee for you, allowing you to leave your current company.”

Stella spoke earnestly.

June paused her shrimp peeling, stunned for a moment before finally voicing her burning question, “President Lang, I want to know, why did you choose me? I don’t think I’m particularly good-looking…”

Stella detected the self-doubt in June’s voice.

She scrutinized the girl’s appearance.

She was a fresh-faced beauty, like the girl next door.

In the entertainment industry, June might not stand out among the sea of handsome faces and beautiful figures, but to Stella, that wasn’t a flaw.

What she cared about was the 9.3 score floating above her head for her street dance skills!

Besides, June wasn’t even unattractive!

If she felt this way about her looks, then Stella should probably bury her own face in the ground and never show it to the world!

“June, what I’m interested in is your dancing talent, not your looks. I want to form an idol girl group focused on singing and dancing in the pop style that’s popular globally. I’m looking for someone who excels in both singing and dancing, not just a pretty face that relies on looks on stage.”

“Although it’s hard to admit, the mainstream idol market right now isn’t solely focused on Western pop; it’s embracing a global fusion. After all, new styles are emerging every day.”

“But I want to create an idol girl group that’s even better than the top groups worldwide!”

June was taken aback by Stella’s bold statement.

An idol girl group that’s better than the top groups worldwide!

What a big ambition!

June quickly stuffed a shrimp into her mouth to calm herself.

She sensed the ambition in Stella’s powerful words.

Did she have such ambition?

Yes, she did.

She had always had the ambition to reach the pinnacle of being an idol, but due to her looks, she had never dared to express it.
