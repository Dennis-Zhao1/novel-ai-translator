**Stellar Performance**

The song "Wish You Long Lasting" quickly became a sensation, dominating trending headlines across major online platforms just a day after a popular fall festival. The Starlet Girl Group was the talk of the town.

Star Entertainment was flooded with invitations for various TV shows, and Stella Lewis carefully selected "The Happy Hour" show on a major network. In just three days, the Starlet Girl Group would perform live, debuting a new song.

Currently, Stella was in a quaint mountain village in Colorado, leading her group and filming team as they shot their second "Seven Fairies" video.

After a busy morning of filming, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, the local hosts, drove the Starlet Girl Group and the filming crew back to their base. Meanwhile, Emily and the others would return to the studio to continue practicing their singing and dancing, keeping them on their toes day after day.

Stella, however, instructed her bodyguard, James, to drive her to the airport; she needed to fly to New York. She was never fully satisfied with the makeup and styling for the girl group. The company was hiring temporary image designers, paying them per design session, but their potential ratings were only around 8 out of 10, never reaching the 9s.

Even a rating of 8 was rare in the U.S. entertainment industry, as most designers with scores above 9 worked for top networks, and Stella didn't have access to them. Recently, she'd spent over a month browsing the fashion section of major social media platforms, finally discovering a promising beauty influencer—Megan.

Megan was a popular influencer on a major video platform, often analyzing celebrity looks with great insight. Not only did she provide analysis, but her makeup skills were also impressive, and she had a knack for styling. However, she was currently only taking private jobs for image design.

Yesterday, Stella sent a direct message from Star Entertainment's official account to Megan, introducing herself and inquiring if she had any plans to join an entertainment company. Megan responded swiftly, expressing her interest in such a position.

Thus, Stella arranged to meet Megan at a café in New York. The reason Stella flew to New York instead of having Megan come to Denver for an interview was simple—she wanted to ensure that Megan's potential rating was above 9 before bringing her on board. It was more efficient for Stella to fly over for the interview rather than reimburse her travel expenses if she turned out to be unqualified.

If Megan had a potential rating above 9, Stella would immediately help her pack and take her back to Denver, ensuring she was fully integrated into Star Entertainment.

After launching her entertainment company, Stella truly understood how rare a good image designer was. Artists could sign contracts for five years, but image designers had to commit to ten.

Around 2 PM, Stella arrived in New York. After a 20-minute cab ride, she reached the café where they had agreed to meet. Upon entering, she noticed Megan was already there. Checking her watch, Stella realized she still had 15 minutes to spare; it seemed Megan took this meeting seriously.

Stella approached Megan's table, extending her hand with a smile, "Hello, I'm Stella Lewis, the president of Star Entertainment. You must be Megan?"

In comparison to her videos, Megan looked even more stunning in person, her face appearing quite small and delicate.

"Yes, hello!" Megan immediately stood up to shake Stella's hand, introducing herself, "My real name is Amy Lane."

"Is it 'Lane' like the street name?" Stella inquired with a chuckle.

"Yes," Amy nodded, amused.

"What a coincidence! We share the same last initial," Stella replied warmly.

They sat down, and Stella discreetly assessed Amy's portfolio, feeling her excitement grow. This was fantastic! Amy had a potential rating of 9.6 for image design!

Amy felt a bit nervous as she looked at the young female president before her. Recently, who among the influencers online hadn’t heard of Star Entertainment? The two videos released on their official channel had both surpassed ten million views.

Now, the Starlet Girl Group was a rising star in the entertainment industry, making waves and garnering attention. Whenever Amy thought back to the first live broadcast of the Starlet Girl Group, where each member wore outfits and accessories worth nearly $300,000, she couldn't help but gasp in awe.

Three hundred thousand dollars! Each member was decked out in around that amount while performing on stage; Star Entertainment was truly extravagant! Not to mention the overwhelming amount of advertisements across various platforms. It was hard to imagine such a company being led by a woman so young.

"I'll be straightforward. I've watched every video of yours online, and I believe in your image design abilities. If you're willing to join Star Entertainment, I'm prepared to offer you a salary of $150,000 a year, which will increase gradually based on your abilities. I can also offer you the position of head designer," Stella stated, before adding a condition: "Of course, there's a prerequisite—you would need to sign a long-term contract of ten years with us."

Amy was already thrilled by the first part of Stella's proposition. As for the ten-year contract, she didn’t take it seriously at all. Ten years? Twenty years? No problem!

A salary of $150,000 was like winning the lottery for her—an up-and-coming image designer just starting her career. Signing a ten-year contract was akin to securing a dream job!

"Ms. Lewis, I'm willing to join Star Entertainment. When can we sign the contract?" Amy asked eagerly.

"… We can sign now; I brought the contracts with me," Stella replied, momentarily taken aback by how quickly Amy agreed.

Stella then retrieved two printed contracts from the briefcase held by James, her imposing bodyguard, and handed one to Amy.

Amy accepted the contract with both hands, sneaking a glance at the sturdy man standing next to Stella. This handsome man radiated masculinity—he must be the bodyguard, right? No wonder she was the big boss; she even had a bodyguard by her side.

After reviewing the contract, Amy found everything acceptable. Once they signed, Stella called a moving company to help Amy relocate.

Amy was not a local resident of New York; she was among the many who had migrated there for work, and she had no objections to relocating to Denver for her job. Hence, her belongings were packed up and shipped to Denver, while she carried only a bag containing her important items.

After wrapping up the moving arrangements, Stella initially planned to take Amy back to Denver but suddenly received a task from her Opportunity Tracker.

[Today's task: Spend $15,000 within 30 minutes!]
[Random task triggered: Spend $8 million within 13 hours!]

Since the task was issued while she was in New York, Stella decided to spend the funds there.

"Amy," Stella called out, "In three days, the Starlet Girl Group will perform on 'The Happy Hour' for their second performance."

"For this performance, the song is called 'American Anthem,' which is rich in traditional American elements. I hope you can buy suitable outfits and accessories for them to wear on stage," Stella explained.

Excited by her first task on the job, Amy readily accepted, taking the unfiltered photos and measurements of the seven members from Stella before setting off to shop.

Amy spent the money with glee; this was her first time designing images for a client without any budget restrictions.

After completing the clothing purchases, Stella noticed there were still $7.5 million left from the task funds and frowned in distress.

Looking around, she spotted a nearby shop selling jewelry.

“Amy, do you think using gemstones as accessories for the girl group members will make them look too flashy?” Stella inquired.

Amy's heart skipped a beat at the question and replied without hesitation, "If the gemstones have good quality and vibrant colors, it’s perfect for the stage."

Upon hearing this, Stella walked straight into the jewelry store. Under Amy's guidance, she bought seven pairs of fresh-colored gemstone earrings, seven gemstone hairpins, seven gemstone bracelets, and seven gemstone necklaces, all made from high-quality gems.

While the quantity of bracelets and necklaces was large, their small sizes kept the prices reasonable, and the total came to $1.5 million.

Compared to jade, gemstones seemed relatively affordable. Unless one found an exceptionally rare piece, high-quality gemstone accessories were typically cheaper than jade pieces.

With $6 million left, Stella decided to treat herself to a few sets of gemstone jewelry. After browsing the store, she ultimately chose two sets worth millions.

One set comprised a necklace, earrings, bracelet, and ring made from 34 pieces of vibrant emeralds, priced at $2 million.

The other set was of high-quality sapphires, priced at $3.5 million. This set included 13 pieces of large sapphire cabochons, featuring a necklace made from 10 semi-transparent oval sapphire cabochons, a pair of earrings, and a ring.

All 13 cabochons exhibited similar water colors, perfectly blending their qualities. Not only were they bright and rich in color, but the exquisite diamond settings showcased dazzling brilliance from every angle, exuding an air of elegance.

With just $500,000 left, Stella purchased a ring made from a colorless diamond.

Amy watched in awe, impressed by the sight.

Now that she was working in such a lavish company, it was likely she'd frequently encounter luxury items like these.

For her as an image designer, simply seeing these treasures was fulfilling enough.

Three days later, the Starlet Girl Group made their much-anticipated appearance on "The Happy Hour" show.

On that Saturday night at 8 PM, the episode featuring the Starlet Girl Group aired, and its viewership ratings soared to the top of the show's ratings chart for the year.

Their performance of "American Anthem" on the show once again went viral.

Stella began using her connections to bring outstanding musical works to the Starlet Girl Group, resulting in continuous viral performances for the group.

In the luxurious indoor stadium established in Denver, the Starlet Girl Group held stage performances every month, consistently drawing full houses.

After six months of rapid development, the Starlet Girl Group had risen to become the top girl group in the U.S.

Compared to idols emerging from popular talent shows, they were no match for the Starlet Girl Group, whether in popularity or quality of work.

At the end of the day, idols depended on their stage presence and musical talent.

If they only relied on participating in various variety shows to sell their personas and pushed mediocre acting roles onto their fans, disappointment would inevitably lead to their fans drifting away.

As the Starlet Girl Group flourished, once the members had grasped their international language skills, Stella began to lead them into the global music scene.

Their first stop was South Korea, home to the mainstream idol market.

Stella had previously signed a five-year lease with a major sports arena in South Korea, and now it was finally time to put that agreement to use.

As they looked at the intricately decorated stage, the audience members invited to attend for free wore indifferent expressions.

Was it a joke that a girl group from the U.S. was performing here? Could they even understand them?

When the Starlet Girl Group took the stage and began introducing themselves in Korean, the audience was taken aback. The fact that this group from the U.S. could speak Korean surprised many, and most responded with applause, although a few remained skeptical, not expecting much from their performance.

But as the group began their show, the atmosphere shifted dramatically.

First came the hip-hop track "I GOT A BOY."

Next was the fiery "HOOT."

Then, they mesmerized the audience with "Speak Your Wish."

Finally, the explosive "Gee" set the place ablaze.

The audience in South Korea erupted, waving their glow sticks and cheering loudly as if they were supporting their own idols.

After this successful performance, the Starlet Girl Group would return a week later for another show, and this time, the audience would be genuinely eager to see them perform, rather than just being attendees.

Before long, the Starlet Girl Group had amassed a huge fan base in South Korea, even appearing on several Korean variety shows.

Thanks to the language barrier being eliminated, members Jennie Park and the male character played by Alex Kim even performed "Trouble Maker" on a Korean variety show, causing the viewership ratings to skyrocket, effectively introducing them to a vast audience in South Korea.

Their performance in South Korea was well-received in the U.S., making fans proud. The song "Gee," which had taken South Korea by storm, was also loved by fans in the U.S., who eagerly demanded Star Entertainment release an English version.

The Starlet Girl Group's expansion into South Korea stirred discontent among many Korean entertainment companies, but before they could take any action, Stella led the girl group into the European and American music market.
