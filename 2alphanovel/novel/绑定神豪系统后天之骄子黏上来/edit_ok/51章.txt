"No problem, I'll pay," Stella said with a confident smile, unfazed by the middle-aged man's attempt to intimidate her.

As they stood in the lobby of Jieyue Entertainment, Stella took a moment to assess the situation. She could feel the tension in the air, the kind that made her heart race but also fueled her determination. This wasn't just about money or contracts; it was about giving talented people the opportunities they deserved.

The middle-aged man's face twisted in disbelief, clearly not expecting Stella's immediate agreement. "You must be out of your mind," he muttered, shaking his head. "Why would you waste two million on a rookie?"

Stella didn't flinch. Instead, she turned to Song Mengmeng, her expression softening. "Mengmeng, I believe in your talent, and I believe in your future. This isn't just an investment in you; it's an investment in what you can become."

Song Mengmeng's eyes glistened, a mix of relief and gratitude washing over her. The journey had been long and fraught with challenges, but here was someone willing to stand by her, someone who saw her potential beyond the present moment.

"Thank you, Stella. I won't let you down," she replied, her voice steady despite the emotional storm inside her.

Stella nodded, then focused back on the man in the suit. "Let's get this done then. I have the funds ready, and Mengmeng has already made her choice."

The man sighed, clearly defeated by Stella's resolve. "Fine," he grumbled, pulling out a stack of papers from his briefcase. "Sign here, and she's all yours."

Stella took the pen, her hand steady as she signed her name. This was more than just a signature; it was a promise of new beginnings and endless possibilities.

As they left Jieyue Entertainment, Stella and Song Mengmeng both felt a weight lift from their shoulders. They walked side by side, the sun warming their faces, a symbol of the brighter days ahead.

"So, what's next?" Song Mengmeng asked, her voice tinged with excitement.

"Next, we build something amazing together," Stella replied, her smile infectious. "Welcome to Star Entertainment. Let's make some magic."
