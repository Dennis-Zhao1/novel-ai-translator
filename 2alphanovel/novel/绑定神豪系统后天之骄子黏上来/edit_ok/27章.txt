**Clarification**

Stella Lane discovered that the incident involving Mandy Young's failed attempt to flirt had also made it to the TikTok trending searches, ranking ninth.

With over five million followers, if Mandy Young's fan count was genuine, then the reach of her videos could not be underestimated. This trending incident was sure to rise even further.

Stella pondered for a moment before forwarding the video to Ethan Clark via text. If he truly was being wronged, it would be better to inform him of the situation sooner rather than later.

Anna, seeing Stella fiddling with her phone, assumed she was taking her advice to heart and was about to comment angrily about Mandy Young. A satisfied smirk tugged at her lips.

With that, she left her workstation, planning to inform other colleagues so they could join in the condemnation. After all, this was a partner company; they couldn't let a small influencer tarnish their reputation.

When Ethan received the text message from his crush, he felt a surge of happiness. However, after watching the video Stella had forwarded, his expression quickly darkened. He immediately called his assistant, instructing him to handle this baseless crisis.

“This video was discovered by one of my colleagues. To clear your name, I think you should report this to the police as soon as possible.”

Staring at Stella's message, Ethan leaned back in his chair, pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration. He sighed. This matter would be resolved quickly, but he was worried about whether Stella might glean any information from the video.

After receiving a polite thank you from Ethan, Stella quickly typed back, “You're welcome,” and added, “I believe you’re being slandered.”

Once work hours began, Stella put her phone down and fully immersed herself in her translation tasks.

Meanwhile, Anna was still glued to her phone, frantically typing out her outraged comments. At that moment, she could focus on nothing else besides bashing Mandy Young.

Noticing her colleagues had put their phones down and were getting back to work, Anna cursed them silently for their lack of seriousness. Clutching her phone, she headed to her supervisor's office.

These colleagues didn’t realize the severity of the situation, but as the marketing department head, Sarah Reed would definitely understand.

To her surprise, when Anna reported the slander against Ethan to Sarah Reed, she was met with a smile. “The people in the main office are already aware of this incident. Apparently, it was someone from our company who notified them.”

“They even called the general manager, praising him for managing the situation well. The general manager just sent me a message saying he plans to commend that employee!”

Anna was overjoyed; Ethan even knew about her actions in the company!

“That’s just what I should do!” she chirped, holding her phone with glee.

“Hmm? You were the one who informed the main office?”

Sarah Reed looked surprised. Could it be that the great contributor was from her department?

“Yes! Once I grasped the seriousness of the situation, I got my colleagues to help me flood TikTok with comments against Mandy Young!” Anna replied with pride.

After all, she had been the one who recognized Ethan in that video from the start, rallying her coworkers into a collective outrage. Who else could do it but her, Anna?

“Alright, I’ll be sure to let the general manager know about this,” Sarah Reed smiled.

Unexpectedly, the ordinarily mediocre Anna had accomplished something significant, earning herself recognition in front of the general manager!

Anna left Sarah Reed’s office beaming, her triumphant demeanor drawing the attention of many colleagues.

Back at her desk, still buzzing with excitement, Anna found it hard to concentrate on work. Instead, she began to fantasize about her future with Ethan.

Anna felt that her encounter with Ethan was as romantic as a drama from a storybook.

She could hardly imagine the intense sparks that would fly when they finally met in person!

Her dream of marrying into a wealthy family seemed like it could really come true!

During the lunch break, Stella received her daily task from the system.

Today, she didn’t go to the administration department to order food because she had money now. Instead, she decided to treat herself to a nice meal out.

Just as she was about to head out, she received the task, so she figured she would go to the nearby American Grill to get a membership card and have lunch there.

Arriving at the grill, Stella quickly signed up for a membership and loaded it with a substantial amount of money, successfully completing her daily task!

“Stella, I want to eat too!” The system’s voice echoed in Stella’s mind as it swallowed its imaginary saliva.

“Sorry, this place doesn’t allow pets inside,” Stella replied awkwardly.

Even if the restaurant allowed pets, there was no way she could feed her pet a steak dinner.

It’s common knowledge that little kittens shouldn’t eat overly salty food.

Moreover, with the system’s insatiable appetite, performing an eating show in front of others would certainly lead to complaints about animal cruelty!

Not to mention, Stella couldn’t take the meal back to her dorm either, due to safety regulations. Cooking in the dorm was strictly prohibited.

If the dorm manager caught her, she would surely face serious disciplinary action!

“How about this? You can just hold off today, and after work, I’ll go look for a place to live. Once we move into a bigger house, you can eat whatever you want,” Stella comforted.

“Okay, but can you buy me a cake after that?” the system asked, conceding.

“Of course!” Stella agreed cheerfully, recalling the cake the system must be craving was from the dessert shop she had passed by earlier.

She remembered the rich, overpowering aroma of cream wafting from the shop and the display case filled with a dazzling array of desserts she had seen through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Stella had already decided that after finishing work that afternoon, she would definitely visit that dessert shop to buy some treats to take back to her dorm.

Since the system wanted to eat, she decided to stop by after enjoying her meal.

She had heard from her roommates that women have two stomachs—one for main courses and another for desserts.

Being a woman herself, she was sure this would be no problem!

In reality, however, Stella had overestimated her own stomach capacity.

The delicious and hearty meal was so appetizing that Stella ended up overeating.

She could only manage to take a couple of bites of those beautifully crafted, fragrant desserts before packing the rest into her bag, all of which eventually ended up in the system’s little kitty belly.

Stella felt incredibly frustrated; the desserts at that shop were truly delicious!

Unfortunately, she just couldn’t eat anymore…

But the dessert shop wasn’t going anywhere. After she finished her work and digested some of her meal, she could come back to savor the treats.

Back at the company, with twenty minutes left before the afternoon shift began, Stella decided to kill time by scrolling through TikTok, only to discover that the trending topic about her was no longer at the top.

Now, the number one trending topic was about Mandy Young being taken away by the police for defamation.

Stella quickly clicked on the headline to watch the most liked video.

This video was clearly the one Mandy Young had previously used, the one containing the surveillance footage that had been manipulated to slander Ethan Clark.

However, in this version, the faces had been blurred, but the quality was clearer, the image stable, and most importantly, the video had sound.

“Hey, can I add you on Facebook?”

“Sorry, I don’t add strangers on Facebook.”

“Are you waiting for your girlfriend?”

In the video, Ethan, whose face was blurred, did not respond to this question, but they could hear Mandy Young’s unmistakable gasp of disbelief, as if she had seen something shocking on his face.

After that, perhaps feeling uncomfortable with Mandy Young’s persistence, Ethan took a step away.

To her surprise, Mandy Young shamelessly followed him, challenging, “What’s wrong with me compared to the person you’re waiting for?”

“Sorry, I don’t want to be disturbed right now,” Ethan replied, his tone noticeably impatient, yet still polite.

“I don’t want to disturb you; I just want to get to know you…” Mandy Young persisted, her tone dripping with false sweetness.

“I’m not interested in getting to know you,” Ethan’s response was cold, clearly indicating he wanted to end the conversation.

After being rejected so brutally, Mandy Young lost her temper, shouting, “Is it just because you have a handsome face? What’s so special about that!”

Though she had already made things awkward, she still clung to Ethan, insisting, “I just want to add you on Facebook and be friends. Do you really need to be so harsh to a girl?”

“I see you don’t have anyone with you. Who is going to see if you add me on Facebook?”

The commotion they were causing, or rather, Mandy Young’s one-sided troublemaking, caught the attention of a nearby shop employee.

“I have someone I like. I won’t add other guys on Facebook. Please stop bothering me!”

Before the employee got close, Ethan dropped this line and walked away.

Mandy Young tried to chase after him, but was stopped by the employee who asked what was going on and if she needed help.

Initially, Mandy Young didn’t respond, but the next moment she burst into tears, starting to twist the truth and accuse Ethan of verbally insulting her.

The employee quickly comforted her and invited her to come inside the shop to rest for a bit.

Mandy Young nodded in agreement, claiming she needed to calm down before entering the shop.

The employee agreed, offering a few more comforting words before returning to her work inside.

Mandy Young wiped her tears, and after calming down for a moment, she walked into the shop.

At that moment, Stella, while watching the video, realized she had brushed past Mandy Young, who had called her “ugly” in the process.

Suddenly, everything clicked into place for her.

Even though her face was also blurred in the video, Stella instantly recognized herself.

How could she not? The faded old clothes she was wearing were far too familiar.

She had said that Mandy Young seemed a bit familiar.

The location in the video was also very recognizable.

It turned out that Mandy Young was the woman who had insulted her when she left the lingerie store last week!

And the incident had occurred on the third floor of the Downtown Mall!

What a coincidence!

So, Ethan had indeed lingered outside that lingerie store!

But why was he standing outside a lingerie shop?

Oh, she almost forgot—Mandy Young had just pointed out in the video that he might have been waiting for his girlfriend.

However, due to Mandy Young’s harassment, he was unable to continue waiting and left the area.

Then, she just happened to run into Ethan at a fast-food place.

Stella frowned, sensing something was off.

So many coincidences piled together made her wonder if Ethan had been waiting for her.

No way! No way!

Stella shook her head, dismissing the thought immediately.

At that time, they didn’t even know each other; how could he be waiting for her?

After banishing such absurd notions, Stella found that the video ended there. Perhaps the surveillance footage from the lingerie store was deemed too private, given it involved women's intimate apparel.

However, the audio from the Downtown Mall’s surveillance was truly impressive!

Stella hadn’t heard Mandy Young’s insults that day, but it turned out that the surveillance had recorded everything with crystal clarity.

Exiting that video, Stella continued scrolling down, soon finding another clip.

Clicking on it, she discovered it was the lingerie store employee who had comforted Mandy Young originally.

The employee appeared on camera, recounting her experience of being deceived by Mandy Young.

The employee mentioned that at the time, Mandy Young claimed she had been verbally assaulted and insulted by a man. Out of kindness, she invited her to come inside the shop to rest, but unexpectedly, a quarrel erupted between Mandy Young and a female customer in the store.

Although the manager intervened to resolve the conflict, it left a bad impression on that customer.

Only after watching the clarification video did the employee realize that Mandy Young might have mistaken that female customer for the girlfriend of the alleged victim, which led her to provoke and argue with her.

“How shameless!”

Stella felt shocked; it was her first time encountering someone so brazenly trying to steal someone else's partner.

Mandy Young even dared to confront the rightful girlfriend and intentionally provoke her; where was her moral compass?

Let alone the fact that the rightful girlfriend might not even be the one Ethan liked.

Uh, people who could smear others online and tarnish the reputations of innocent individuals clearly had no sense of right and wrong.

In addition to the employee’s video, the female customer who had gotten into the argument with Mandy Young also posted a video on TikTok, detailing how Mandy Young had provoked her, and she ended up so furious she nearly lost her voice.

“...I don’t know that man! I’m married with a husband! For no reason, this Mandy Young came up with a reason to insult me. I really want to see what kind of parents could raise such a girl! This is too much!”

Stella empathized; she had also been insulted by Mandy Young for no reason that day, and it made her furious.

After that, a staff member responsible for the surveillance at the Downtown Mall stepped forward to provide the final clarification, releasing another piece of surveillance footage.

The staff member explained that the reason the surveillance video Mandy Young had released lacked sound and was shaky was that she had secretly recorded it with her phone!

Last Thursday night, Mandy Young had falsely claimed her wallet was stolen in the mall and asked staff to check the surveillance.

To ensure the safety of their customers’ property, the staff had promised to help Mandy Young retrieve the footage, but who would have thought she was secretly filming it with her phone without their knowledge?

As the staff watched the footage, listening to the conversations, they realized something was wrong.

This was clearly not a case of a stolen wallet; it was a case of unrequited love.

When the staff questioned her, Mandy Young dodged the inquiry, claiming she had forgotten her wallet, and then she just left the surveillance room.

Unbeknownst to Mandy Young, the surveillance room also had cameras, and every lie she told to the staff was recorded clearly.
