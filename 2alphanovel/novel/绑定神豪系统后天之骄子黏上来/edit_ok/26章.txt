Stella Lewis woke up feeling refreshed after a fantastic night's sleep. At 5 AM, she grabbed her phone and checked her bank account balance. The numbers confirmed itâ€”she was a multi-millionaire. A wide grin spread across her face as the realization sunk in. It was time to start house-hunting.

The thought of soon becoming a homeowner made Stella giddy. She tossed and turned in bed, rousing the little virtual assistant cat that slept beside her.

"Ready for some tasks today?" the virtual cat asked, rubbing its eyes with tiny paws.

Stella chuckled, "Not today! Why don't you sleep a little more?" She coaxed the virtual cat back to sleep and quietly got out of bed.

Instead of grabbing breakfast from her usual spot, Stella decided to treat herself to some takeout. She ordered two large bowls of scrambled eggs and bacon, two cups of freshly brewed coffee, and two blueberry muffins. With delivery, it came to $20.

In the past, Stella would never have splurged on breakfast like this, but now that money was no longer an issue, indulging felt perfectly normal. Plus, she'd been craving bacon and eggs since she woke up.

Back at her apartment, the delicious aroma of breakfast filled the air. The virtual cat perked up, "What's that smell? It smells amazing!"

"I ordered scrambled eggs and muffins! Come eat!" Stella laughed, inviting the virtual cat.

There were six muffins in total, but Stella only took one for herself and left the rest for the virtual assistant.

The rich, savory aroma of the eggs mingled with the crispy bacon, instantly making her mouth water. She took a bite. "Yum, so good," Stella exclaimed, savoring the flavors.

The eggs were fluffy, and the bacon was cooked to perfection. Feeling rejuvenated, Stella finished her meal and made her way to the office.

Today, she didn't arrive at work an hour early. When she got there, she noticed several colleagues gathered around Lisa's desk, buzzing with excitement.

Curious, Stella leaned in closer to find out what they were discussing.

"Stella, did you see that viral video yesterday?" Lisa asked enthusiastically.

"Uh, I did. Why?" Stella replied, intrigued.

Not only had she watched, but she'd also made a generous donation during a live stream.

"Then you must have seen the 'Best Gift for Kids' trending video?" Lisa continued.

"Uh, not sure," Stella said, confused.

Lisa urged her to check the trending topics, and Stella pulled up her phone. The top trending topic was indeed titled "The Best Gift for Kids."

Clicking on it, Stella realized it was about her! Her donation during the stream had made headlines.

"Do you think the mysterious donor will reveal themselves?" a colleague speculated.

"Maybe it's all a marketing strategy," another chimed in.

"They should come forward before the buzz dies down," someone else added.

"Or maybe they genuinely wanted to help?" a colleague countered.

Hearing that made Stella blush a little. Her initial intention wasn't that noble. She'd stumbled upon it due to a lucky draw.

Laughter erupted around her as her colleagues teased, "No way!"

"If they wanted to help, they'd donate directly, not through tips," Lisa chuckled.

Stella felt a bit down; to outsiders, it looked foolish or self-serving.

"Maybe they wanted to bring attention to a good cause," another colleague suggested.

Stella glanced at the new colleague, Sarah, who seemed to believe in the goodness of people. Stella wanted to tell her that wasn't entirely true.

"You may be right," Lisa said, stifling a grin.

Seeing someone agree, Sarah smiled at Lisa, her innocent expression charming everyone.

Stella felt a connection and decided to exchange contact information with Sarah. After a brief chat, they returned to their workstations.

Just as Stella sat down, she felt a wave of tension in the air. She turned to see Wendy furiously typing on her phone, muttering, "Unbelievable! She had the nerve to post that online!"

Stella felt a chill run down her spine. What was Wendy upset about this time?

She wanted to move away, but Wendy suddenly grabbed her arm, "Check this out on TikTok!"

"Huh?" Stella asked, baffled.

"Look at this video," Wendy said, thrusting her phone in Stella's face.

The video showed a girl crying, explaining how she tried to add a guy on social media and got rudely rejected.

"So why should I care?" Stella asked, confused.

Wendy pointed at the man in the video, "That's Jack Collins, the CEO of our potential business partner!"

Stella blinked, recognizing him. No wonder he looked familiar.

Remembering her own encounter with Jack, Stella doubted the girl's story. He had been nothing but polite.

"Now you know who he is, right? Help me defend him!" Wendy insisted.

"Okay," Stella replied, though she had no intention of getting involved in an online spat.

She didn't believe in attacking someone online. If the girl was wronged, she shouldn't put it online; if she was lying, it could be defamation.

Stella decided to handle things her own way. She believed in addressing issues directly and positively.
