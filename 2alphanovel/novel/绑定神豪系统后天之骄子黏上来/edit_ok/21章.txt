Two days ago, Stella Lang received an unexpected task reward of $1,500 from her system, which she used to buy a new smartphone. Today, her daily task sent her another $1,500. After giving it some thought, she decided to invest in a new laptop.

Her old laptop was so slow it was practically a relic, so upgrading to a new model seemed like the best choice. Sitting comfortably on her couch, she opened her laptop app on her phone and began browsing.

Her new phone, a top-brand model, had a crystal-clear display and ran smoothly; the investment was definitely paying off. So, for her laptop, she wanted to stick with the same brand.

Stella's current laptop, with its 15.6-inch screen, had been her companion for a while, and she wasn't keen on downsizing. But when she checked the official store for her favorite brand, the latest 16-inch model with the best configuration was a whopping $3,500! Even the most basic model was $2,500!

Seeing the prices made Stella pause. Maybe a smaller screen wasn't such a bad idea after all. She could adapt. Checking out the 13-inch model revealed that the lowest configuration was just under $1,500, leaving her with some extra cash to recharge her phone plan.

As she hovered over the purchase button, she felt a tug of doubt. Why not go for something better? Even though it was more than double the price, wouldn’t it be more comfortable to use?

After a moment of reflection, Stella finally decided to splurge on the 16-inch model for $3,500, which meant dipping into her savings for an extra $2,000.

"Congratulations, Stella! You've completed today's daily task! Keep up the good work tomorrow!" the system chimed in her head.

With this purchase, the $15,000 she had won in a lottery previously, after settling some debts, took quite a hit. However, she felt satisfied, believing the extra expense for a better laptop was justified.

Today's task funding had surprisingly increased tenfold from yesterday. Considering that tomorrow's task funding might also increase tenfold, Stella started daydreaming about what she might buy next.

"Tomorrow it's $15,000, and the day after that it could be $150,000. So then the day after tomorrow..." she mused, imagining herself buying a house in the city instead of renting.

But reality quickly set in, and she doubted the task funding would balloon so dramatically. If it did, she'd be wealthier than some small countries!

"Yes, you’re correct; the daily task funding won’t increase that quickly," the system confirmed. "At this stage, $1,500 is the fixed amount for daily tasks. To increase the daily task funding, you'll need to rely on the system's lottery to draw skills that can enhance the funding amount. Only then will the daily task amount see any growth."

Stella nodded, acknowledging the system's explanation. "So tomorrow’s daily task amount is still $1,500," she concluded, feeling content with the daily amount even if it never increased.

Since the store where Stella made her order was located nearby, and with an hour left before the end of her workday, the laptop was delivered to her office promptly.

Stella didn’t open the package immediately, but her coworker, Lisa, noticed the brand name on the courier box and teased, “Wow, did you spend your whole internship salary on that laptop?”

Stella chuckled and replied, “Is your salary any higher than mine?”

Lisa couldn't help but huff and roll her eyes as she returned to her desk. Stella, amused but unfazed, knew she wouldn’t have to deal with the pettiness for much longer.

The next day's task funding remained at $1,500, just as the system had indicated. During her lunch break, Stella received her new task and had only 30 minutes to complete it. She set her sandwich aside and dashed out to a nearby sports store to buy two pairs of shoes.

One pair was a pair of fluorescent running shoes for $170, and the other was a versatile pair of white sneakers for $70.

Stella had always been impressed with the brand's reputation for quality and integrity, but her budget had previously held her back. Now that she had money that needed to be spent, buying these felt like fulfilling a small wish to support a conscientious brand.

Afterward, Stella browsed through a nearby outdoor sportswear store, purchasing two sets of sportswear, including casual short-sleeved shirts, shorts, and sports bras.

One set consisted of a light pink jacket with black tapered pants for $160, and the other was a beige hoodie with gray casual pants for $150. The casual shirts were $60 and $45, respectively, while the shorts were $60 and $75. The sports bras were $75 each.

Stella thought about her sprinting skill and decided to get fit once her leg injury healed. She wanted to be strong enough to use her skill without issue.

But she knew that goal wouldn't be easy. Maybe only a true world sprint champion could use that skill without straining themselves.

With $570 remaining from her task funding and only 15 minutes until the task deadline, Stella felt a bit overwhelmed. There were many things she needed, but too little time to buy them all.

Why didn't the store have anything more expensive, like shoes that could cost more than $170? Spending would have been easier!

Stella quickly returned to the sportswear store, spending $45 on a black waist bag, $30 on a small backpack, and $60 on two UV protection caps. She also bought nine pairs of colorful sports socks for $50 and a pink water bottle for $60.

With $325 left, she decided to use a delivery app to order a $140 five-person meal from the city's best roast duck restaurant, leaving her with $185 to top off her taxi app.

Carrying her purchases back to the office, Stella felt a bit of a thrill. It was the most she had ever spent on a water bottle!

Her colleagues were surprised to see her return with so many items.

Curious, Mark, a colleague, asked what she had bought.

“Just some sports gear, like shoes and clothes,” Stella replied with a smile.

“Planning to work out?” another colleague asked.

“Yeah, I want to start running in the mornings to get healthier,” Stella explained.

“Wow, you really went for the high-end stuff,” Mark said, noting the brand names.

“Yep, I wanted something durable,” Stella said, making up an excuse. If she didn't have to spend the $1,500 in half an hour, she wouldn't have bought such pricey gear.

In truth, she didn’t need new gear to start running; her old high school gym clothes would have sufficed.

“Brand-name clothing does tend to last longer,” a colleague agreed.

“Hmph!”

A disgruntled noise came from nearby as Lisa slammed her documents down, clicking her mouse with excessive force.

Some colleagues dispersed, but Mark rolled his eyes at Lisa before telling Stella, “Alright, I’ll let you eat. Enjoy your meal!”

“Thanks, Mark,” Stella said with a smile.

Sometimes, Stella just couldn't understand Lisa. Why did she have to act so petty when someone else bought something nice? It seemed so small-minded.

After work, Stella carried her bags out of the office. The taxi she'd booked was already waiting at the building's entrance.

The company was close to the roast duck restaurant, but since she’d just topped off her taxi app, why walk when she could ride?

Besides, with her leg still healing, walking made her calves sore. Until she fully recovered, Stella planned to rely on taxis.

Five minutes later, the car stopped in front of the restaurant. She picked up her order, right on schedule for 5:20 PM.
