**Stellar Performance**

News about the song "Wish You Long Lasting" dominated the trending headlines across major online platforms just a day after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Beidou Girl Group had quickly become the keyword of the moment.

Stellar Entertainment was inundated with invitations for various variety shows, and Stella Ling sifted through them, ultimately selecting the "Happy Family" variety show on Mango TV. In just three days, the Beidou Girl Group would be performing on this show, showcasing a new song in the process.

At that moment, Stella was leading the Beidou Girl Group and her filming team in a picturesque little mountain village in Mianzhou, Sichuan Province, shooting their second "Seven Fairies" video. 

After a busy morning of filming, Wang Ping and his wife drove the Beidou Girl Group and the filming crew away from the location. Xu Shujun and the others would return to the company to continue practicing their singing and dancing, keeping them extremely busy day after day. 

Stella, on the other hand, instructed her bodyguard, Jiang Feng, to drive her to the airport; she needed to fly to Shanghai. She had never been fully satisfied with the makeup and styling for the girl group. Currently, the company was hiring temporary image designers, paying them per design session, but their potential scores were only around 8 points, never breaking into the 9s.

However, even a score of 8 was a rarity in the Chinese entertainment industry, as most designers with scores above 9 worked for CCTV, and Stella had no access to them. Recently, she'd spent over a month browsing the fashion section of major short video platforms, finally discovering a promising beauty influencer—Damei Ni.

Damei Ni was a popular influencer on B Station's fashion section, often analyzing celebrity looks with great insight. Not only did she provide analysis, but her makeup skills were also impressive, and she had a knack for styling. However, she was currently only taking private jobs for image design.

Yesterday, Stella sent a private message from Stellar Entertainment's official account to Damei Ni, introducing herself and inquiring if she had any plans to join an entertainment company. The response was swift; Damei Ni expressed her interest in such a position. 

Thus, Stella arranged to meet Damei Ni at a café in Shanghai. The reason Stella flew to Shanghai instead of having Damei Ni come to Chengdu for an interview was simple—she wanted to ensure that Damei Ni's potential score was above 9 before bringing her on board. It was more efficient for Stella to fly over for the interview rather than reimburse her travel expenses if she turned out to be unqualified.

If Damei Ni had a potential score above 9, Stella would immediately help her pack and take her back to Chengdu, ensuring she was fully integrated into Stellar Entertainment. 

After launching her entertainment company, Stella truly understood how rare a good image designer was. Artists could sign contracts for five years, but image designers had to commit to ten.

Around 2 PM, Stella arrived in Shanghai. After a 20-minute taxi ride, she reached the café where they had agreed to meet. Upon entering, she noticed Damei Ni was already there. Looking at her jewelry watch, Stella realized she still had 15 minutes to go; it seemed Damei Ni took this meeting seriously.

Stella approached Damei Ni's table, extending her hand with a smile, "Hello, I'm Stella Ling, the president of Stellar Entertainment. You must be Damei Ni?"

In comparison to her videos, Damei Ni looked even more beautiful in person, her face appearing quite small and delicate. 

"Yes, hello!" Damei Ni immediately stood up to shake Stella's hand, introducing herself, "My real name is Ling Xiaoyu."

"Is it the 'Ling' with two water radicals, meaning 'to be arrogant'?" Stella inquired. 

"Yes," Ling Xiaoyu nodded.

"How coincidental! We share the same surname," Stella replied with a smile. 

After that, they sat down, and Stella activated her Insightful Eyes to scrutinize Ling Xiaoyu, feeling her lips curve up involuntarily. 

This was fantastic! Ling Xiaoyu had a potential score of 9.6 for image design! 

Ling Xiaoyu felt a bit nervous as she looked at the young female president before her. In recent days, who among the influencers on B Station hadn’t heard of Stellar Entertainment? The two videos released on B Station's official account had both surpassed ten million views. 

Now, the Beidou Girl Group was a rising star in the entertainment industry, making waves and garnering attention. Whenever Ling Xiaoyu thought back to the first live broadcast of the Beidou Girl Group, where each member donned outfits and accessories worth nearly 2 million, she couldn't help but gasp in awe. 

Two million! Each member was decked out in around 2 million worth of attire while performing on stage; Stellar Entertainment was truly extravagant! Not to mention the overwhelming amount of advertisements across various platforms. It was hard to imagine such a company being led by a woman so young.

"I'll be straightforward. I've watched every video of yours on B Station, and I believe in your image design abilities. If you're willing to join Stellar Entertainment, I'm prepared to offer you a salary of one million a year, which will increase gradually based on your abilities. I can also offer you the position of head designer," Stella stated, before adding a condition: "Of course, there’s a prerequisite—you would need to sign a long-term contract of ten years with us."

Ling Xiaoyu was already thrilled by the first part of Stella's proposition. As for the ten-year contract, she didn’t take it seriously at all. Ten years? Twenty years? No problem! 

A salary of one million was like winning the lottery for her—an up-and-coming image designer just starting her career. Signing a ten-year contract was akin to securing an iron rice bowl!

"President Ling, I’m willing to join Stellar Entertainment. When can we sign the contract?" Ling Xiaoyu asked eagerly.

"… We can sign now; I brought the contracts with me," Stella replied, momentarily taken aback by how quickly Ling Xiaoyu agreed. 

Stella then retrieved two printed contracts from the briefcase held by Jiang Feng, her imposing bodyguard, and handed one to Ling Xiaoyu.

Ling Xiaoyu accepted the contract with both hands, sneaking a glance at the sturdy man standing next to Stella. This handsome man radiated masculinity—he must be the bodyguard, right? No wonder she was the big boss; she even had a bodyguard by her side.

After reviewing the contract, Ling Xiaoyu found everything acceptable. Once they signed, Stella called a moving company to help Ling Xiaoyu relocate. 

Ling Xiaoyu was not a local resident of Shanghai; she was among the many who had migrated there for work, and she had no objections to relocating to Chengdu for her job. Hence, her belongings were packed up and shipped to Chengdu, while she carried only a bag containing her important items.

After wrapping up the moving arrangements, Stella initially planned to take Ling Xiaoyu back to Chengdu but suddenly received a task from the Celestial Fortune System. 

【Today's daily task: Spend 100,000 yuan within 30 minutes!】  
【Random task triggered: Spend 55 million yuan within 13 hours!】

Since the task was issued while she was in Shanghai, Stella decided to spend the funds in Shanghai. 

"Xiaoyu," Stella called out, "In three days, the Beidou Girl Group will perform on Mango TV's 'Happy Family' variety show for their second performance."

"For this performance, the song is called 'Chinese Speech,' which is rich in traditional Chinese elements. I hope you can buy suitable outfits and accessories for them to wear on stage," Stella explained.

Excited by her first task on the job, Ling Xiaoyu readily accepted, taking the unfiltered photos and measurements of the seven members from Stella before setting off to shop.

Ling Xiaoyu spent the money with glee; this was her first time designing images for a client without any budget restrictions. 

After completing the clothing purchases, Stella noticed there were still 53.89 million yuan left from the task funds and frowned in distress. 

Looking around, she spotted a nearby shop selling jade accessories. 

“Xiaoyu, do you think using jade as accessories for the girl group members will make them look too old?” Stella inquired.

Ling Xiaoyu's heart skipped a beat at the question and replied without hesitation, "If the jade has good quality and vibrant colors, it’s perfect for young girls to wear."

Upon hearing this, Stella walked straight into the jade accessory store. Under Ling Xiaoyu's guidance, she bought seven pairs of fresh-colored jade earrings, seven jade hairpins, seven jade bracelets, and seven jade necklaces, all made from glass-type jade. 

While the quantity of bracelets and necklaces was large, their small sizes kept the prices reasonable, and the total came to 1.24 million yuan. 

Compared to gemstones, jade seemed relatively affordable. Unless one found an exceptionally rare color, glass-type jade accessories were typically cheaper than gemstone pieces. 

With 52.65 million yuan left, Stella decided to treat herself to a few sets of jade jewelry. After browsing the store, she ultimately chose two sets worth millions.

One set comprised a necklace, earrings, bracelet, and ring made from 34 pieces of vibrant green jade, priced at 13.8 million yuan. 

The other set was of imperial green jade, priced at 38 million yuan. This set included 13 pieces of large jade cabochons, featuring a necklace made from 10 semi-transparent oval jade cabochons, a pair of earrings, and a ring.

All 13 cabochons exhibited similar water colors, perfectly blending their qualities. Not only were they bright and rich in color, but the exquisite diamond settings showcased dazzling brilliance from every angle, exuding an air of royal elegance.

With just 850,000 yuan left, Stella purchased a ring made from a colorless glass-type jade cabochon.

Ling Xiaoyu watched in envy, drooling at the sight. 

Now that she was working in such a lavish company, it was likely she'd frequently encounter luxury items like these. 

For her as an image designer, simply seeing these treasures was fulfilling enough.

Three days later, the Beidou Girl Group made their much-anticipated appearance on Mango TV's "Happy Family" variety show. 

On that Saturday night at 8 PM, the episode featuring the Beidou Girl Group aired, and its viewership ratings soared to the top of "Happy Family's" ratings chart for 2022.

Their performance of "Chinese Speech" on the show once again went viral. 

Stella began using her parallel universe notebook to transport outstanding musical works, resulting in continuous viral performances for the Beidou Girl Group.

In the luxurious indoor stadium established in Chengdu's High-Tech Zone, the Beidou Girl Group held stage performances every month, consistently drawing full houses.

After six months of rapid development, the Beidou Girl Group had risen to become the top girl group in China. 

Compared to idols emerging from popular talent shows, they were no match for the Beidou Girl Group, whether in popularity or quality of work.

At the end of the day, idols depended on their stage presence and musical talent. 

If they only relied on participating in various variety shows to sell their personas and pushed mediocre acting roles onto their fans, disappointment would inevitably lead to their fans drifting away. 

As the Beidou Girl Group flourished, once the members had grasped their international language skills and learned Han language, Stella began to lead them into the international scene.

Their first stop was Han Nation, home to the mainstream idol market. 

Stella had previously signed a five-year lease with the Indoor Sports Arena in Han Nation, and now it was finally time to put that agreement to use.

As they looked at the intricately decorated stage, the audience members invited to attend for free wore indifferent expressions. 

Was it a joke that a girl group from China was performing here? Could they even understand them?

When the Beidou Girl Group took the stage and began introducing themselves in Han language, the audience was taken aback. The fact that this group from China could speak Han language surprised many, and most responded with applause, although a few remained skeptical, not expecting much from their performance.

But as the group began their show, the atmosphere shifted dramatically.

First came the hip-hop track "I GOT A BOY." 

Next was the fiery "HOOT." 

Then, they mesmerized the audience with "Speak Your Wish." 

Finally, the explosive "Gee" set the place ablaze. 

The audience in Han Nation erupted, waving their glow sticks and cheering loudly as if they were supporting their own idols. 

After this successful performance, the Beidou Girl Group would return a week later for another show, and this time, the audience would be genuinely eager to see them perform, rather than just being attendees.

Before long, the Beidou Girl Group had amassed a huge fan base in Han Nation, even appearing on several Han variety shows. 

Thanks to the language barrier being eliminated, members Park Han-eun and the male character played by Feng Xiaocong even performed "Trouble Maker" on a Han variety show, causing the viewership ratings to skyrocket, effectively introducing them to a vast audience in Han Nation.

Their performance in Han Nation was well-received in China, making fans proud. The song "Gee," which had taken Han Nation by storm, was also loved by fans in China, who eagerly demanded Stellar Entertainment release a Chinese version.

The Beidou Girl Group's expansion into Han Nation stirred discontent among many Han entertainment companies, but before they could take any action, Stella led the girl group into the European and American music market.
