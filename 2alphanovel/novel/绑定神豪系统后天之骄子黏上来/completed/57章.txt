9.7 Points

After listening to Park Han-eun's explanation, Stella Ling raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Even if I recruit you into the company, it doesn't guarantee that you'll take the center position in the girl group. The artists I bring on board are all exceptionally talented."

Instead of feeling belittled, Park Han-eun responded with excitement, "That’s even better! I just can't stand seeing someone weaker than me in the top spot. If everyone in the team is strong, I’ll be even happier."

From what she had observed so far, Stella felt that Park Han-eun had a great personality—tenacious, competitive, and with high potential. She addressed the girl in front of her, "Let’s see your talent showcase."

As soon as Stella finished her sentence, she noticed a shift in the aura around Park Han-eun. The girl exuded a unique, almost intoxicating vibe, her expression turning charmingly alluring. 

Park Han-eun twisted her waist gracefully, her back straightening, her hips accentuated, and she extended her arms in a fluid motion. 

Her dance moves appeared somewhat slow; they weren’t the high-energy, intricate routines Stella had seen performed by other girl group dancers. Yet, Park Han-eun danced beautifully, with every strand of hair and fingertip contributing to an enchanting performance. 

Watching her, it was easy to forget that she was dancing; instead, it felt as though she was simply reveling in the stage that belonged solely to her. 

Having seen plenty of performances from Han-kuk’s entertainment industry, Stella was not a fan of the suggestive choreography often designed to please audiences. However, when Park Han-eun executed these moves, there was nothing overtly sexual about it.

Park Han-eun's dance struck a perfect balance between allure and sensuality, effortlessly distinguishing between the two. She moved with a lightness that made the difficult choreography seem effortless, her style distinctly her own.

Her facial expressions were spot on; she understood precisely what emotion to convey with each movement. Despite not having an exceptionally striking appearance, she radiated an arresting beauty while dancing, with the beauty mark beneath her left eye glimmering under the lights.

A captivating atmosphere surrounded Park Han-eun as she danced, one that made spectators want to keep watching. Her sensuality seemed to emanate from her very core, rather than relying on provocative movements.

When the performance concluded, Stella, along with Li Xiang and Zhou Yulan, applauded in unison as if they were all in sync.

Li Xiang couldn’t help but praise internally, thinking that this girl’s performance had been the best among all the auditions he had witnessed!

In response to the applause, Park Han-eun maintained her composure, bowing at ninety degrees to express her gratitude to Stella and the others.

Stella, twirling her ruby ring, smiled at Park Han-eun. "You danced wonderfully. I genuinely want to recruit you into the company. Are you interested in joining us at Celestial Entertainment?"

Regardless of the person's capabilities, employment has always been a mutual decision based on willingness.

"I'd like to know more about the company first," Park Han-eun replied.

"Of course," Stella nodded. 

Celestial Entertainment had only recently obtained its business license, and there wasn’t much information available online. The only thing accessible was a standard business query platform that confirmed it was a legitimate company.

After reviewing recruitment ads on platforms like Coin Station, Douyin, and Weibo, many were curious about the background of this newly emerged entertainment company.

Stella explained the size and direction of the company, as well as the style she envisioned for the girl group she intended to form.

"…So that's about it. If you join Celestial Entertainment, the girl group currently consists of just three members. I haven't decided how many more to add, but it won't exceed eight," Stella summarized.

After listening to Stella’s explanation, Park Han-eun felt one thing: this boss really knew how to boast.

She understood very well that the entertainment scene in Hua Country was not suitable for idol singers and dancers. It wasn’t that she wanted to undermine her own country, but Hua Country didn’t even have a proper stage for idols to showcase themselves. The much-hyped talent show that had recently been trending online was abruptly shut down due to interference from higher-ups.

The idea of a C-POP girl group that could surpass Han-kuk’s K-POP idols and conquer overseas audiences seemed utterly unrealistic to Park Han-eun.

But did she have any other options?

At least the company's scale seemed decent. The boss even specifically mentioned that there was a stage and that the artist contracts included a clause prohibiting coercive practices.

Before coming to the interview at Celestial Entertainment, Park Han-eun had attended several auditions at other entertainment companies. 

However, due to her lack of popularity domestically, coupled with the halt of the talent show, and with her looks not being particularly outstanding, those companies ultimately did not take her on.

Once brimming with confidence upon her return, Park Han-eun now found herself with dwindling self-assurance.

If she had debuted in GY, she would have naturally attracted numerous companies vying for her attention upon her return.

Yet here she was, without a foothold in her own country, and this Stella was willing to offer her generous terms and conditions without shutting her out.

What more could she ask for?

At this point, aside from the refusal of coercive practices, as long as she had a small stage to showcase her talent, she would be more than satisfied.

Ultimately, Park Han-eun signed the artist contract with Celestial Entertainment.

Due to the lengthy interview process, the candidates waiting outside couldn’t help but murmur among themselves about why it was taking so long.

Just as some were growing impatient, they finally saw the girl who had gone in for the interview emerging, accompanied by a young woman who appeared to be a company executive.

The two were engaged in quiet conversation, but they looked so cheerful that onlookers could guess the interview had been successful.

Park Han-eun hailed from the Autonomous Prefecture of Changbai in Jilin Province. After returning from Han-kuk, she had been searching for an entertainment company in Hu City that would accept her.

After encountering multiple setbacks, she had planned to head to Jing City to continue her search, only to find herself signing a contract with a local entertainment company in Chengdu.

Stella brought Park Han-eun to the service apartment where Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng lived.

Upon seeing the apartment’s grandeur, Park Han-eun couldn’t help but be amazed. 

Such a luxurious place was actually the dormitory for the company’s artists!

It was a far cry from the accommodations she had during her trainee period in Han-kuk!

While Han-kuk’s entertainment companies were willing to invest in promoting their artists, they would never provide such excellent living conditions.

After all the interviews for the day concluded, Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng finally returned to the apartment.

At that moment, Park Han-eun realized that the two girls she had seen at the interview venue were not just hired assistants; they were also signed artists with Celestial Entertainment like herself.

“Hello, I’m Park Han-eun, the new artist signed by President Ling,” she politely introduced herself to the two.

“Hi, I’m Song Mengmeng!” Song Mengmeng greeted with a wave, her face beaming with joy.

“Hello, I’m Xu Shujun,” Xu Shujun nodded in response.

Stella observed the three girls, noting that they shared similar values and should get along without issues.

It was Saturday, and Stella had asked the staff to work overtime throughout the day. Aside from the overtime pay, it was only right to treat them to a nice dinner as a reward.

[Today’s daily task: Spend 100,000 yuan within 30 minutes!]

“小星, Are we eating at that place from yesterday? Their roasted suckling pig is so delicious!”

“Absolutely!” 

Stella signaled an "OK," leaving Xu Shujun and the others puzzled.

When Li Xiang saw Stella recharge another 100,000 yuan onto the membership card for the Haoyue Restaurant, he was left speechless. 

Let her spend; after all, President Ling was rich.

With President Ling's wealth, the company wouldn't go under, and he wouldn't lose his job.

In the following days, on July 3rd and 4th, 167 and 233 girls came for interviews, respectively. Among them, only two girls scored above 9 points in potential, but their character levels didn’t meet the top tier, so Stella decided not to sign them.

Li Xiang thought President Ling was too picky.

Some of the girls who came for interviews were incredibly beautiful, but if they were slightly lacking in talent, President Ling wouldn’t give them a chance.

Li Xiang had initially thought that as long as one was good-looking, they could make it in the entertainment industry.

The reality, however, was that beauty alone wasn’t enough. One needed a backing capital willing to support them; otherwise, breaking into the industry would still be tough.

On July 5th, Stella looked at the interview venue, where no girl had scored above 9 points in potential. She sighed inwardly.

As the deadline for interviews approached, Stella handed her resume to Li Xiang and left the venue alone.

[Today’s daily task: Spend 100,000 yuan within 30 minutes!]

[Random task triggered: Spend 15 million yuan within 5 hours!]

After receiving the financial task, Stella thought for a moment. Since she had nothing else to do, she decided to visit a luxury store in the International Financial Building and buy a few items.

On the third floor, Stella strolled around and planned to enter the nearest BVLGARI store.

Upon entering, she overheard enthusiastic discussions among several sales associates.

“Can you believe this random little entertainment company dared to hang their sign on the rooftop? People who don’t know better might think the whole building belongs to them!” one salesgirl scoffed.

“Exactly! If our store wasn’t so unsuitable for a high-rise, would a small entertainment company even get a chance to hang their sign? Do they think they can compete with internationally recognized brands?” another added.

“Hasn’t the manager talked to the property management about this?”

“No, but I heard that the store next door…”

Just then, the jewelry salesgirl noticed Stella’s presence and quickly plastered on a smile, addressing her, “Hello, welcome to the BVLGARI boutique! How can I assist you today?”

“...I don’t need anything; I must have walked into the wrong store,” Stella chuckled awkwardly and exited the shop.

If she wasn’t mistaken, this so-called “little entertainment company” they were disparaging referred to Celestial Entertainment, right?

Yesterday, under Manager Liu’s guidance, the sign for Celestial Entertainment was installed on the rooftop of the International Financial Building.

Stella had been quite excited about it, but she hadn’t anticipated that her decision would ruffle some feathers among certain businesses in the building.

However, the rooftop space was the most expensive; whoever rented it had the right to hang a sign!

Why should she care about their petty remarks?

Stepping out of the International Financial Building, Stella began searching for luxury stores nearby.

Soon, she was captivated by a dreamy jewelry store called Harry Winston.

Stella was familiar with this brand; it was one of the top ten jewelry brands in the world.

Just as she was about to enter, her attention was drawn to a figure.

Potential score: 9.7, Martial Arts Performance.

9.7 points!

9.7 points!!!

And her character level was top-tier!

What was she doing buying jewelry? She needed to seize this opportunity!

With that thought, Stella quickly logged into her online banking to transfer the funds for today’s daily task and the random task into the company’s account, then hurried towards the direction of the 9.7-point girl.

Feng Xiaocong stood outside the International Financial Building, holding her resume with a hesitant expression.

The time for allowing interview candidates to enter had already passed, and she didn’t know why she was still standing there.

At that moment, Feng Xiaocong had lost the decisiveness typical of a martial artist. She was unsure if she should come back tomorrow for another interview.

Before Stella could approach, Feng Xiaocong sensed her presence and swiftly turned her head, her sharp gaze locking onto the approaching figure.

Wow!

Stella stumbled back a step, internally marveling at Feng Xiaocong’s piercing eyes and her striking appearance.

“...Sorry,” Feng Xiaocong said apologetically, seeing that the person was around her age.

With that, she turned to leave.

Stella quickly caught up and, getting straight to the point, said, “Hi, I’m Stella Ling, president of Celestial Entertainment. I think your image fits our recruitment standards perfectly. Are you interested in debuting as an artist?”

Upon hearing "Celestial Entertainment," Feng Xiaocong paused.

She stared at Stella for a few seconds, and what came out of her mouth was, “I don’t want to be a stunt double.”

“Ah?” Stella was perplexed, her face a question mark. “Why would I want you to be a stunt double when you look so good?”

“Inviting you to join the company is definitely to make you a visible artist!” 

Feng Xiaocong was taken aback. Did someone just compliment her on her appearance?

This was the first time anyone had said she looked good.

Her looks could be described as passable; she was somewhat easy on the eyes due to her martial arts training, which made her spirit and energy slightly better than the average person. However, she didn’t think she met the standards for an entertainment artist.

Had she not known about Celestial Entertainment and submitted her resume to this company, she might have thought Stella was trying to con her.

Feng Xiaocong hesitated for a moment and said, “I applied to Celestial Entertainment and received an interview notice, but I was late today.”

In fact, she hadn’t been late; she had simply been standing outside for too long.

After arriving in Chengdu, Feng Xiaocong couldn’t help but feel a loss of confidence as she frequently saw girls with stunning skin and beauty.

She suddenly felt unworthy of the interview. Since she couldn’t compete with the local girls, she thought it would be a waste of time to go in for an interview.

Who would have thought that standing outside would lead her to meet the president of the company, who would personally invite her to join?

“It’s okay! You weren’t late by much!” Stella waved her hand, then asked, “Do you have your resume with you? Can I take a look?”

“I do!” Feng Xiaocong nodded and handed over the resume she had been holding.

As Stella smiled and looked at the resume in her hand, her astonishment only grew.
