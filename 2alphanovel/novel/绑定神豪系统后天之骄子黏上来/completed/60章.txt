Report to President Ling

Yang Yuxiu sat frozen in her seat, feeling as though her entire worldview had just shattered. 

This was the first time she had ever encountered something like this. It turned out that her classmates were not as friendly as they appeared on the surface. 

Through the resume incident, Yang Yuxiu had already confirmed that the young woman before her was indeed the president of Xingchen Entertainment. However, signing with a company was such an important decision that she needed to discuss it with her parents first. 

Stella Ling understood and arranged to meet Yang Yuxiu the next afternoon at the company. 

The next morning, another 55 interviewees arrived at the company, but not a single one had a potential score in the entertainment industry exceeding 9 points. 

Stella felt disappointed, but she quickly reminded herself that they would be signing a new artist that afternoon, which lifted her spirits a little. 

At 3 PM, Yang Yuxiu arrived punctually at Xingchen Entertainment with her parents. 

Yang Yuxiu’s parents, Yang Hezuo and Li Sitong, were not locals from Rongcheng; they hailed from Liangshan Prefecture in Sichuan Province. 

Yang Yuxiu was not a day student; she had left school after class yesterday, mainly because she couldn’t stand the subpar food at the school cafeteria any longer. 

Upon hearing that their daughter had caught the attention of an entertainment company, both of her parents took a day off from work and took the train to Rongcheng the next day. 

Now, seeing the scale of the entertainment company and where their daughter would be living, the couple expressed their satisfaction. 

However, after reviewing the contract their daughter was about to sign, they hesitated. 

Having never seen contracts from other entertainment companies, they couldn’t make a comparison, but the amount listed for the termination fee—30 million—was staggering. 

They realized they would never earn that much in their lifetime! 

Yang Yuxiu didn’t feel too worried. She thought about the outrageous termination fees she had read about for top idols online; those amounts were way more than what was written in this contract. Besides, weren’t those top idols able to pay them off with ease? 

Yang Yuxiu wasn’t sure if she could earn as much as those top stars after entering the entertainment industry, but she was well aware that the current entertainment scene was tough to break into. Only artists who caught the eye of capital or the wealthy second-generation could thrive in this industry.

She considered herself a lucky girl from an ordinary background, not even majoring in acting, to have caught the attention of the president of an entertainment company. She felt she had no right to be picky.

Moreover, because of the resume incident, she had a particularly good impression of President Ling. 

After all, President Ling didn’t have to help her investigate the resume issue. She could have simply said she didn’t know, and Yang Yuxiu wouldn’t have pressed the matter further. 

Yet, President Ling took the initiative to help her uncover the truth, revealing the true nature of the classmate who had tampered with her resume. 

President Ling genuinely respected her, which made Yang Yuxiu eager to sign with Xingchen Entertainment. 

Thinking about this, Yang Yuxiu took the initiative to persuade her hesitant parents, sharing the story of the resume incident. 

She explained that if it weren’t for President Ling’s visit to the school to scout for talent, she might have forever lost her chance to enter the entertainment industry. 

Yang Hezuo and Li Sitong were taken aback after hearing their daughter’s experience. 

Is it really that cutthroat among classmates these days? 

Their daughter had a year left before graduation; would she continue to be targeted by that classmate during this time? 

That student, Jiang Moping, seemed to be in the same dormitory as their daughter. 

As a father, Yang Hezuo wanted to confront Jiang Moping at school and warn her not to bully his daughter. But he hesitated, feeling that as a grown man, it would seem like he was using his size to intimidate a child. 

Moreover, they didn’t have any solid evidence to accuse Jiang Moping of sabotaging Yang Yuxiu; if the student claimed they were slandering her and demanded proof, they wouldn’t be able to provide it, which would only make their daughter suffer more. 

When Stella Ling learned that Yang Yuxiu shared a dormitory with the student who had altered her resume, she suggested, “You don’t have to worry about that. If Yuxiu signs with our company, she can stay in our apartment. The company provides cars and drivers for artists, so she’ll have transportation to and from school.” 

After a moment of consideration, Yang Hezuo nodded in agreement, standing up with his wife and daughter to express their gratitude, “Thank you for your care, President Ling. Let’s go ahead and sign the contract.” 

In the end, Stella Ling successfully secured Yang Yuxiu, who had a 9.3 score in ethnic dance talent, as a member of her girl group. 

On July 8, the last day of interviews, 33 girls arrived at the company. 

The total number of applicants over the past seven days was 12 fewer than the original notification count, meaning 12 girls who had received interview invitations had stood Xingchen Entertainment up. 

Stella was initially unhappy about this, but when she saw a stunningly beautiful girl from a foreign background among the interviewees, and noticed that her potential score and character rating met her hiring standards, her mood brightened instantly. 

This high-spirited girl was clearly from the Zhu Province Autonomous Region. 

However, with a 9.5 score in acting ability, should she become a member of the girl group or pursue a career as an actress directly? 

After all, the girl’s talent lay in acting, not in singing or dancing. 

But the minority groups from Zhu Province were known for their singing and dancing skills; surely, her abilities in those areas wouldn’t be lacking, right? 

It was such a dilemma! 

Before even signing her, Stella Ling was already contemplating what path this 9.5-scoring girl should take. 

When it was the turn of the 9.5-scoring girl to interview, Stella entered the small office. 

She took her seat at the interviewer’s desk and watched as the girl introduced herself. 

“Hello, esteemed interviewers! My name is Fariha Reheimu, I’m from the Uyghur ethnic group, 20 years old, and I’m studying acting at the Shanghai Theater Academy. My specialty is Uyghur dance.” 

Fariha stood tall, her back straight as she gazed ahead. 

Stella could see that the girl was somewhat nervous and smiled reassuringly, “Fariha Reheimu, you don’t need to be nervous. The moment I saw you outside, I thought about signing you.” 

“What year are you in, and does your school allow you to shoot films while studying?” Stella asked. 

She knew that some acting programs had strict management policies that prohibited students from shooting films during their studies, while others were more lenient. 

“We can. Our school has a rule that students can’t shoot films before their sophomore year. I’m currently a sophomore, and after this summer break, I’ll be a junior, so I can start shooting films.” 

Fariha nodded eagerly, but the prospect of being signed by a seemingly important woman only heightened her nerves, making her inadvertently slip into a slight accent when speaking Mandarin. 

“Alright then, if you want to sign with our company, I can offer you two options,” Stella laid out. 

“First, I can directly guide you on the path of acting, finding scripts and a good filming team for you. You just need to focus on honing your acting skills and filming.” 

“Second, you can join our company’s girl group, perform on stages domestically and internationally, and once you’ve built up a certain fan base, you can transition into acting.” 

“I’ll give you ten minutes to think it over.” 

Fariha considered for only a few seconds before responding, “I’ve made my choice; I want to join the girl group first.” 

Acting directly, even if it was a leading role, who would know who she was? 

There was a risk that her first project could flop. 

Besides, nowadays, the top stars in the entertainment industry were clearly idols who attracted fans more than actors did. 

As long as they had a fan base, it didn’t matter how poorly they acted; their popularity would remain strong. 

Today’s entertainment industry was all about the traffic model; she’d better join the girl group first. 

After all, this manager had just mentioned she would later have the opportunity to act. 

Stella Ling was somewhat surprised but not too shocked, as she knew that the most active figures in the entertainment world today were indeed those who started as idols. 

“Your choice is very wise, and it aligns perfectly with the company's current focus on developing girl groups.” 

“Don’t worry, although we can’t hold talent shows anymore, I’ll invest resources in the girl group that are on par with those of talent shows, ensuring you’ll rise to fame quickly.” 

Stella stood up from her seat, smiling reassuringly. 

With her ability to connect with parallel worlds through her laptop, making such a promise was not at all empty. 

Sitting nearby, Li Xiang and Zhou Yulan exchanged puzzled glances. Wasn’t the president someone who only valued talent and was very picky about looks? 

Why had she decided to sign the Uyghur girl without even seeing her talent? 

After that, Stella took Fariha out of the interview area and brought her to the top floor of the building to show her the company’s scale before leading her to the temporary office space that served as their apartment. 

“As you just saw, the company is still under renovation, so the living room of this apartment is temporarily used as an office.” 

“However, the soundproofing is excellent, and this apartment has four rooms; one is occupied by girl group member Yang Yuxiu, while the other four members are in the apartment across the hall. There are still three rooms left here for you to choose from.” 

Stella explained. 

Fariha nodded, expressing her satisfaction with the company’s scale and accommodation, but she was more eager to see the contract. 

Stella nodded and took out the contract to hand to Fariha. 

After reading the contract, Fariha realized that the young woman before her was not only a manager but also the owner of Xingchen Entertainment. 

She was pleased with the contract’s content, especially the five-year term. 

Before coming here for the interview, Fariha had also interviewed with several entertainment companies in Shanghai. 

While they were satisfied with her looks, the terms of their contracts for newcomers were far from satisfactory. 

It was either a 10-year or a 15-year contract. 

When Fariha refused to sign with one company due to dissatisfaction with the contract, the manager directly berated her, calling her an outsider who didn’t understand the rules. 

He insisted that all entertainment companies in Huaguo offered such conditions to newcomers, telling her not to be ungrateful and that she’d be throwing away a great opportunity. 

Fariha was not one to be intimidated; she stood up and left that entertainment company, but she spent the rest of the day crying in her dorm after being scolded by an outsider. 

After that, she saw Xingchen Entertainment’s recruitment ads on Douyin. 

Learning that the company was located in Rongcheng, Sichuan Province, she hadn’t planned to come here for an interview, as she preferred to develop in Shanghai or Beijing. 

However, Xingchen Entertainment seemed to have spent an enormous amount on advertising, and it appeared in various recommendations on Douyin, making Fariha feel quite unsettled. 

She closed Douyin and opened Weibo, only to find more recruitment ads for Xingchen Entertainment! 

Switching to Bilibili, she found ads there too! 

Eventually, Fariha relented and decided to submit her resume to this entertainment company on a whim. 

She hadn’t expected that after the interview, she would discover that Xingchen Entertainment offered such great conditions for newcomers! 

The more Fariha looked at the contract, the more satisfied she became, and after getting her parents’ consent over the phone, she signed her name. 

Watching Fariha lean over to sign, Stella Ling couldn’t help but smile broadly. 

Now, the girl group already had six members. 

Stella decided that once they recruited a member who could sing operatic styles, she would stop hiring. 

Seven was a lucky number! 

Since Fariha’s school had an early summer break, she moved into the apartment that night. 

That evening, Stella naturally organized a dinner for the artists and staff, allowing them to meet the new member. 

This time, she arranged for the staff to be in a separate private room while she stayed in the same room with the girl group members, as she had something important to discuss with them. 

Xu Shujun felt somewhat restless upon seeing the new addition to the girl group. 

The members recruited by President Ling were all stunning, each more beautiful than the last. 

Was she now the least attractive one in the group? 

Little did Xu Shujun know that aside from the straightforward Song Mengmeng, the elegant Yang Yuxiu, and the equally lovely Feng Xiaocong and Park Haneun, all three felt like they were the least attractive members in the girl group. 

As the three of them battled feelings of inferiority, Stella Ling surveyed the room and cleared her throat. 

“Ahem!” 

“I’d like to know if any of you have objections to cosmetic surgery?” 

Stella announced. 

Xu Shujun immediately snapped out of her self-doubt, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Stella, asking, “President Ling, is the company going to provide us with cosmetic surgery?” 

“Yes, but we won’t be doing any major surgeries or random injections. We’ll only be making some minor adjustments. As long as the base isn’t too bad, we can use makeup to compensate for any deficiencies in looks.” 

“I want everyone to have a bit of confidence. The reason I signed you is not just for your looks, but for your talents. I hope the girl group I’m building will stand out based on talent and excellent work, rather than just appearance.” 

As she said this, Stella glanced at Fariha and added, “Fariha, I didn’t sign you just for your looks.” 

What did she see in me then? 

Fariha was filled with confusion, having never showcased her talents to Stella. 

She was left wondering what qualities Stella had recognized in her that led to the signing. 

Fariha felt troubled as Stella didn’t continue the conversation after that, and she didn’t dare to press further. 

“Can I get a nose job, then? President Ling, I think my nose is a bit flat.” 

Song Mengmeng raised her hand, eager to ask. 

Stella scrutinized Song Mengmeng’s nose and replied, “No way! Your nose isn’t flat at all! That’s a very tricky area to operate on; best to leave it alone if possible!” 

Song Mengmeng persisted, raising her hand again to inquire, “Then can I get double eyelid surgery?” 

Stella looked at Song Mengmeng’s big eyes, puzzled, “But aren’t you already double-lidded? Why would you want to get it done again?” 

“Report to President Ling, my double eyelids are fake!” 

With that, Song Mengmeng pulled off two clear strips from her eyelids. 

They were double eyelid tapes.
