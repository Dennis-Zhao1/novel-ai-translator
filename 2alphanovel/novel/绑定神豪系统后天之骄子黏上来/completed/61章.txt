**Searching for the Last Girl Group Member**

After peeling off her eyelid tape, Song Mengmeng rubbed her eyes, and the double eyelid creases disappeared instantly. 

Stella Ling observed Song Mengmeng, whose eyes seemed to have shrunk a size but remained strikingly large. After a moment of contemplation, she said, “If you want to get surgery, I can arrange that for you.”

Joy erupted in Song Mengmeng’s eyes as she raised her tiny fists in excitement, exclaiming, “Thank you, President Ling!”

There’s nothing that can deter a woman’s pursuit of beauty. Seeing that Song Mengmeng had the chance for eyelid surgery, the other members eagerly chimed in, expressing their dissatisfaction with various facial features and discussing the cosmetic procedures they desired. 

Xu Shujun spoke up, “President Ling, can’t we change our face shape?”

Stella Ling shook her head firmly. “No, that’s too risky. Besides, your baby fat is your charm! It’s adorable, okay? You and Mengmeng are fine with just getting eyelid surgery.”

Feng Xiaocong interjected, “President Ling, I think every part of my face needs work!”

Stella Ling countered, “It’s not as exaggerated as you think. You just have a bit of nasolabial folds. Fix that, get double eyelids, and maybe reshape your brows, and you’ll be fine.”

Park Haneun asked, “What about me, President? My double eyelids are also taped.”

Stella Ling waved her hand decisively. “Then get surgery!”

Yang Yuxiu chimed in, “President Ling…”

“Your cheeks are too thin. We’ll have to consult a doctor to see if there’s a safe, side-effect-free way to improve that,” Stella Ling replied.

“Got it~” Yang Yuxiu nodded, satisfied.

“Faliha, what about me?” 

Stella Ling turned to consider the gorgeous Faliha, with her delicate features and soft lines, reminiscent of a blend of Eastern and Western beauty. Other than her slightly darker skin, she had almost no flaws. 

“You just need to lighten your skin and shape your brows,” Stella Ling concluded after a moment’s thought.

Looking around at the group, Stella Ling added, “As for cosmetic surgery, I’m not the expert. You’ll need to consult with a qualified doctor for specific procedures.”

“Here's the plan: for those without passports, get them sorted quickly. Once they arrive, we’ll head to the best cosmetic hospital in Han Country to see what’s best for you all,” she instructed.

Speaking of which, Han Country is currently known for having the best cosmetic surgery techniques. Many parents there gift their children with cosmetic procedures as a coming-of-age present, signifying how mature the technology has become.

Although cosmetic surgery in Huaguo is improving, it still lags behind Han Country. However, a notable downside to Han Country’s procedures is that many resulting beauties look like mass-produced replicas—while attractive, they lack individuality, resembling a shared face among many.

Stella Ling, having studied Han language in college, often watched Han dramas to practice, which led her to discover quite a few unique-looking Han celebrities. Recently, she had researched cosmetic surgery online and learned that some of her favorite distinctive Han actresses had undergone procedures, and their original looks were quite similar to Xu Shujun’s, yet they hadn’t lost their charm.

This proved that there were indeed top-tier plastic surgeons in Han Country who didn’t adhere to a cookie-cutter approach. But, as a foreigner, she might not easily find such doctors.

If only her keen insight could help her recognize a surgeon’s skill level!

With the prospect of going to Han Country for cosmetic procedures, the girls present buzzed with excitement, momentarily forgetting their meals as they dove into discussions about the opportunities there.

Park Haneun took the lead in this conversation, having lived in Han Country for five years and trained as a trainee in a well-known entertainment company. She was undoubtedly the most knowledgeable about the Han entertainment scene among the group.

Stella Ling contemplated asking Park Haneun about the cosmetic hospital associated with GY Company. However, she ultimately decided against it, as her online research had shown that she wasn’t particularly fond of the styles of GY Company’s artists post-surgery.

Stella preferred the looks of PYJ Company’s idols. Yet, overall, she found the beautiful actresses from Han Country more aligned with her aesthetic standards than their idols.

The next day, Stella Ling bought a ticket and flew to Jing City. 

Now, the girl group only needed one member skilled in acting, and she needed to recruit quickly before heading to Han Country for their transformations. 

Upon arriving in Jing City, Stella took a taxi straight to the Jing City Vocational Academy of Traditional Chinese Opera. 

This academy allowed public visits, so Stella registered with her ID at the security desk and entered the school. 

Today was Saturday, and with no classes, students were everywhere. As Stella listened to the conversations around her, she realized today was the graduation day for the class of 2018. 

That explained the bustling atmosphere—it was like a festival!

What a stroke of luck! She could take advantage of the graduation ceremony to scout potential candidates among the graduates.

The 2018 graduates were likely around her age, mostly 23 years old. Initially, she planned to recruit members aged 18 to 22, but she figured a year older wouldn’t hurt.

After exploring every corner of the school, Stella had her eye on a girl dressed in a graduation gown, boasting an impressive potential score of 9.3, expertise in Peking opera, and a top-tier personality rating. 

The girl was stunning, with a classical beauty that captivated Stella. 

“Hi, I’m Stella Ling, the president of Xingchen Entertainment. I think your image perfectly fits our criteria for recruiting talents. After the graduation ceremony, can we have a chat?” Stella approached the girl, who was taking photos with her classmates, and smiled.

Hearing this, Cheng Luyi hesitated, glancing at her friend beside her. 

Seeing her friend give her a gentle nudge to encourage her, Cheng Luyi finally nodded and replied, “Sure.”

As they settled into the auditorium to watch the graduation performances, Cheng Luyi’s mind was elsewhere, preoccupied with the earlier conversation. 

“Miao Miao, do you think I should enter the entertainment industry?” she leaned closer to her friend and whispered.

This wasn’t her first encounter with a talent scout; she had declined previous offers. 

Cheng Luyi’s parents hoped she would stay at school as a teacher or join a theater, pursuing a career in drama. They wanted her to have a stable job, not to enter the chaotic entertainment world. 

“Of course you should! The entertainment industry pays well! And it’s not as easy to break into as it used to be. Nowadays, popular artists are often the children of wealthy families. For common girls like us, making it in this industry is incredibly rare!” Li Miaomiao urged, feeling frustrated that her friend had turned down several talent scouts in the past. 

She couldn’t let her friend miss this opportunity again!
