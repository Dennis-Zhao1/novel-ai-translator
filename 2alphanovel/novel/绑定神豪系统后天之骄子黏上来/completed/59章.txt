**A Little Trick**

Stella Ling blinked her eyes and looked at Lin Yueya, who was sitting in the driver’s seat. Instantly, a potential value and character level appeared above her head.

Great! The Insightful Eye is usable again.

“Lin Jie, let’s head back to school,” Stella said.

“Okay,” Lin Yueya replied.

Half an hour later, the car stopped once more outside the entrance of the Sichuan Provincial Dance Academy. 

There were still ten minutes until the students' lunchtime break.

Peering through the car window, Stella gazed expectantly at the school gate. 

Just as it struck eleven-thirty, students started streaming out of the school, one after another, with the numbers steadily increasing.

Stella felt a twinge of anxiety as the first wave of students were all boys. When would she catch sight of any girls?

Ah, here they come!

6.7, 8.1, 6.5, 7.1...

Since most of the students in this academy were professional dancers, it was rare for Stella to spot any female students with a potential score below 6.

Wait, there’s one with a score of 9!

9.2, character level... low-quality.

Low-quality individuals care only for their own interests while trampling on others’ rights.

Stella was taken aback. After all, these girls were still students, likely untouched by the harsh realities of society. How could their character be...

Maybe it’s due to their family environment...

No matter how regrettable, this girl couldn’t possibly be recruited into the company.

As the students exited the school, many couldn’t help but cast their eyes toward the sleek black Rolls Royce parked beside the gate.

“That car is so cool!”

“Look at that logo; it must be a Rolls Royce! Why is the Spirit of Ecstasy black?”

“It must have been repainted! It looks bigger than a regular Rolls Royce; could it be custom?”

“Could it belong to some school leader who just bought it?”

Due to the privacy film on the Rolls Royce Cullinan Black Badge’s windows, the students outside couldn’t see inside clearly; they could only make out a silhouette in the driver's seat.

Knowing someone was inside, they didn’t dare approach to admire the vehicle.

However, there was one bold girl, the one with a potential score of 9.2, who stepped closer to the car. Under the watchful eyes of Stella and Lin Yueya, she pulled out some lipstick from her bag and began touching up her makeup against the window on the driver’s side.

Using the window as a mirror, she meticulously applied lip gloss, enhancing her lips.

If it had stopped there, Stella and Lin Yueya wouldn’t have thought much of it. But then the girl pulled her tank top down slightly, revealing a curvaceous figure.

Lin Yueya, furious, pressed the car horn, startling the girl who was flaunting her assets.

Taken aback, the girl waited for a moment outside the car. Seeing that the car owner had no intention of getting out, she pouted in disinterest and walked away.

The girl’s antics had already drawn the attention of the surrounding students, who began to murmur among themselves. Yet, she seemed completely unfazed, striding away with an air of elegance as if nothing had happened.

“Who is that girl? So brazen!” 

“She’s Xiao Yanrong from the Class 2 of Ethnic Dance, Class of 2019.”

“It’s her! I didn’t recognize her at first! Isn't she usually so proud? And here she is, fawning over some rich person like that! It’s so embarrassing!”

“What’s wrong with that? If the car's owner was a woman, I’d do the same!”

“Wow! Such a spirit of sacrifice! I admire your ambition!”

“Are you out of your mind? You think that’s something to be proud of?”

A couple of students couldn’t hold back their criticism, exclaiming that their values were utterly warped!

“Mind your own business!”

After exchanging disdainful glances, the two groups dispersed unhappily.

Lin Yueya, watching the scene outside and recalling the girl’s earlier behavior, vented a long string of expletives in her local dialect. 

The gist of her words was that if her own two children dared to act in such a disgraceful manner, she’d break their legs!

Stella stayed silent, pondering that once Starshine Entertainment officially entered the entertainment world, she might often encounter such situations.

While she found it distasteful, she couldn’t control others. All she could do was protect her artists from the hidden rules of the industry.

Stella kept watching the students return to class, and aside from the girl with the 9.2 score, she didn’t spot any other female students with a score above 9.

Her eyes began to tire, and her stomach grumbled. She decided to have Lin Yueya drive them to a place to eat.

They arrived at a local restaurant near the school known for its Jianghu-style cuisine.

The place was bustling with customers, and it took Stella and Lin Yueya a while to find a recently vacated table.

Stella inhaled deeply, savoring the aroma of the spicy oil wafting through the air, her mouth watering uncontrollably.

She opened the menu and ordered two cups of the house specialty tea, which everyone seemed to be drinking.

After consulting Lin Yueya, Stella ordered a serving of triangular rice cakes with osmanthus sauce, sesame balls, two servings of brown sugar sticky rice porridge, a famous bread chicken from Laoshan City, signature grilled fish, soft sticky pork knuckle, four skewers of grilled squid, and four skewers of grilled eel slices.

The first dish to arrive was the house tea, which contained red dates, goji berries, jasmine flowers, and chrysanthemums. It was refreshingly delicious and could be refilled indefinitely.

Since it was kung fu tea, the staff member responsible for brewing the tea presented a special performance in front of the guests.

Next came the triangular rice cakes, sesame balls, and brown sugar sticky rice porridge.

The triangular rice cake, made of millet, was exceptionally soft and fluffy, sweet, and fragrant, perfectly complemented by the aromatic osmanthus sauce—absolutely delicious!

The sesame balls were golden, large, and round, resembling a moon brought to the dining table.

The brown sugar sticky rice porridge was sweet and smooth, incredibly tasty.

After Stella and Lin Yueya polished off the entire plate of triangular rice cakes, the main courses began to arrive.

The famous bread chicken from Laoshan City, when the outer layer of bread was torn apart, revealed a foil-wrapped chicken inside. Upon unwrapping the foil, the fragrant aroma of the beggar’s chicken wafted over.

Drizzling the secret red oil over the chicken made the meat soak up the rich flavor. One bite was simply heavenly!

The soft sticky pork knuckle lived up to its name, with its double-pepper flavor making it tender and non-greasy.

The signature grilled fish was tender, spicy, and fragrant—one bite transported you to a different world, a true blessing for spice lovers, though this dish was made with grass carp, which had a few bones.

The grilled squid and eel skewers were also delightful, with each bite offering a satisfyingly indulgent experience!

An hour later, the dining table was left with nothing but empty plates. Stella contentedly sipped her tea.

She used to think she had a small appetite, but after coming to Chengdu, she finally understood.

It wasn't that she ate less; it was simply that the food wasn't delicious enough.

【Xiao Xing, I’m so hungry! When will it be evening?】

The gluttonous little cat was rolling around in Stella's mind, meowing incessantly.

So tantalizing!

Is there anything more torturous than seeing others enjoy a feast while you can’t partake?

“Calm down, it’s only one o’clock. In a few hours, it’ll be evening—time will fly by,” Stella reassured herself as she savored another sip of tea.

After leaving the restaurant, Stella chose not to get back in the car. Instead, she decided to take a stroll around the area, hoping to spot potential future artists for her company among the bustling crowd.

Regrettably, after wandering for the entire afternoon, she hadn’t found any promising candidates with a potential score above 9.

Returning to the dance academy, Stella resumed her stakeout.

In twenty minutes, school would be letting out.

Students were coming out!

Stella perked up, her gaze fixed intently on the students.

6.3, 8.7, 7.7... 9.3!

Taking a closer look at the character level, it was high-quality!

Stella was elated and immediately stepped out of the car, striding toward the girl with the 9.3 score.

Yang Yuxiu had just exited the school gate when someone blocked her path.

Thinking it was a suitor, she squinted to see a casually dressed young woman.

Before Yang Yuxiu could ask what the young woman wanted, she heard her say, “Hello, I’m Stella Ling, the president of Starshine Entertainment. I think your image fits our company’s criteria for recruiting artists. Would you be interested in becoming an artist?”

“Me?” Yang Yuxiu exclaimed, her face filled with surprise.

Starshine Entertainment—was that the very company she had submitted her resume to?

Several students from their program had gone for interviews, but she hadn’t heard of anyone getting through.

Yang Yuxiu harbored a dream of entering the entertainment industry, and since Starshine Entertainment was local, she had submitted her application. However, she hadn’t received any interview notification.

Watching her peers receive interview invitations only served to discourage Yang Yuxiu.

Yet here she was, unexpectedly receiving a personal invitation from the president of Starshine Entertainment today.

But hadn’t her application been rejected?

Stella and Yang Yuxiu found a nearby café to sit down and talk slowly.

As they conversed, Stella learned that Yang Yuxiu was indeed interested in entering the entertainment industry, though the young student had doubts about her identity.

Stella didn’t find this surprising. When she was scouting in Sanlitun in Beijing, eight out of ten trainees were skeptical of her being a scammer until she managed to recruit Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng.

“If you don’t believe me, we can go to the company right now, and you can see for yourself,” Stella suggested.

Noticing Yang Yuxiu still hesitating, she sensed the girl was wary of getting into her car.

That was understandable. Even though both she and Lin Jie were women, Yang Yuxiu was alone, and it was natural for her to be cautious about entering a stranger's vehicle.

It’s a good thing for girls to be cautious—nowadays, human traffickers have numerous tricks up their sleeves, and being on guard is crucial for ensuring their safety.

“It’s fine. If you’re scared, let’s add each other on WeChat. I’ll send you the company address. You can come by tonight or tomorrow, and you can even bring a parent or friend with you,” Stella smiled.

Upon hearing this, Yang Yuxiu’s doubts eased a bit, but she still felt uncertain about her application.

“President Ling, I actually submitted a resume to Starshine Entertainment, but I didn’t get an interview notification.”

“Hmm? How is that possible?” Stella asked, puzzled. “You should meet the height and age requirements, right?”

“I do! I’m 21 years old and 165 cm tall,” Yang Yuxiu replied.

“Then did you edit your photos or use filters?” Stella inquired further.

“Absolutely not! I followed the company’s requirements when I submitted my resume,” Yang Yuxiu quickly shook her head.

Stella set her coffee down, contemplating whether she had overlooked something or if Chen Duo hadn’t paid attention.

Yang Yuxiu’s appearance was outstanding—she had a slender figure, an elegant face, and long hair that exuded grace. If she truly submitted her resume correctly, there was no way she wouldn’t be selected.

With that thought in mind, Stella immediately called Chen Duo to ask if she had deleted the resumes that were filtered out.

“No, President Ling, they’re all in the email’s trash folder,” Chen Duo replied.

“Then please look for Yang Yuxiu’s resume, restore it, and send it to me on WeChat,” Stella instructed.

“Sure.”

Since the resumes had the applicants’ names clearly marked, it was easy to find. Chen Duo quickly retrieved Yang Yuxiu’s resume and sent it to Stella.

As Stella opened the resume, she discovered that Yang Yuxiu was actually of the Bai ethnic minority—one of the minority groups.

If Yang Yuxiu signed a contract, that would mean the girl group would have members from four different ethnic backgrounds.

This aligned perfectly with her vision of emphasizing the inclusivity of Chinese culture.

Continuing to read through the resume, Stella found it was very standard without any issues. The only problem must lie with the photos.

Stella clicked on the images, and she was stunned.

Stella: “…”

“What’s wrong? Is there something amiss again?” Yang Yuxiu asked anxiously, noticing Stella’s change in expression.

“Uh, did you send this photo?” Stella asked, holding her phone out toward Yang Yuxiu.

The image displayed an exaggerated inverted triangle face, alien-like big eyes, and a conspicuous beauty mark drawn beside her mouth, all enhanced with heavy whitening and smoothing filters—clearly a case of over-editing.

Yang Yuxiu gasped, quickly defending herself, “I didn’t do that! I didn’t use any filters!”

“I believe you,” Stella reassured the girl in front of her. If it were just mild editing, she might have questioned Yang Yuxiu’s honesty, as many girls tend to prefer their filtered selves, believing that’s their best look.

But these photos were clearly a prank gone wrong.

For someone eager to enter the entertainment industry, sending such photos would be akin to sabotaging her own opportunities—no one in their right mind would do that.

“Think carefully. Has anyone tampered with your resume?” Stella asked.

“I—I submitted the resume myself; I didn’t change the photos,” Yang Yuxiu replied. Then, as if recalling something, she suddenly exclaimed, “I sent my resume right before a classmate borrowed my laptop!”

Stella nodded, understanding dawning upon her.

In that case, the likely suspect was the classmate who borrowed Yang Yuxiu’s computer.

Emails sent from a computer can be recalled within a 24-hour window.

That classmate probably accessed Yang Yuxiu’s email without logging out and retracted the email, making some tweaks.

“Hang on; let me call and check. If the email was recalled and then resent, the recipient will have access to the record,” Stella said, before taking her phone back to make the inquiry with Chen Duo.

Eventually, Stella received confirmation from Chen Duo that indeed, there had been two emails from Yang Yuxiu, with the second one being empty, indicating it was never sent.

Hanging up the phone, Stella looked seriously at Yang Yuxiu, “It seems you should keep your distance from that classmate.”

Yang Yuxiu: “……”
