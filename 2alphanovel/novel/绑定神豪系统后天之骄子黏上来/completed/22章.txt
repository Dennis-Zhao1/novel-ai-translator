Weekly Task

After returning to her dormitory, Stella Ling tossed the shopping bag filled with sports gear aside and eagerly placed the roast duck set meal on her desk.

Since entering university, the most extravagant thing Stella had done was spend an extra 450 yuan to move into a four-person dormitory for a better study environment, instead of spending nearly 300 yuan on a famous roast duck from the capital. After four years of university, she finally got to taste the roast duck from Quanjude!

To commemorate her first experience with capital roast duck, Stella meticulously arranged the dishes from the meal on her desk. She even turned on her desk lamp for better lighting before taking a picture to post her very first moment on social media. 

She captioned it: “First time eating Quanjude roast duck.”

“It smells so good! Can we eat now?” the little cat system chimed in, drooling as it gazed at Stella.

“Sure, but remember to leave me half of that roast duck!” Stella nodded, giving a reminder. 

She recalled the last time they had KFC; she was still wary of the system’s voracious eating habits.

“Okay, okay!” The little cat nodded vigorously and immediately grabbed a piece of the lotus leaf pancake to wrap around the sliced roast duck and condiments.

As soon as the stuffed pancake entered its mouth, the little cat's eyes lit up, sparkling like bright stars in its vibrant green gaze.

Seeing the system enjoy the food so much, Stella put on a pair of disposable gloves and also grabbed a lotus leaf pancake. 

Although it was labeled as a five-person set meal, there was only one roast duck inside, while the other dishes were quite plentiful.

There were four cold dishes: mustard duck feet, saltwater duck liver, old-style sauced beef, and assorted vegetables. 

The hot dishes included five items: black truffle yam shrimp balls, fire-roasted duck hearts, Sichuan-style duck blood soup, black pepper beef cubes, and oil-drizzled romaine lettuce. 

The roast duck came with two servings of lotus leaf pancakes and five servings of traditional condiments, plus a large bottle of passion fruit juice.

Aside from the roast duck, Stella’s favorite dish was the saltwater duck liver—it was tender and flavorful.

As for the system, it loved every single item, even devouring the leftover scallions from the condiments.

Once they finished eating, Stella leaned back in her chair, sipping the sweet and tangy passion fruit juice, letting out a satisfied sigh. 

The roast duck was indeed delicious! 

“Maybe I’ll order another one tomorrow!” she thought, opening WeChat and noticing that her very first social media post already had likes and comments.

There were two comments, one from Li Qichen and the other from her best friend, An Liyu.

An An (An Liyu): “Looks so delicious! I must try the authentic capital roast duck when I come to visit you in the capital!”

Stella smiled and replied to her friend, “Hurry and come! I’ll treat you!”

Chen (Li Qichen): “This roast duck is quite good, but I still think the best is from Linyan Tower. You should try it someday.”

Stella quickly thanked Li Qichen for the recommendation: “Thanks for the tip!”

His response was prompt: “No problem!” followed by a smiling emoji.

Quanjude was the most famous roast duck restaurant in the capital, and Stella had never heard of Linyan Tower before. 

But that was alright; she had already decided that when her friends visited, she would take An An to both Quanjude and Linyan Tower to taste the roast duck!

That way, they would know which one was the best!

After exiting the social media app, Stella noticed another friend request on WeChat. She didn't need to click on it to know who it was.

For the past two days, Lu Mingxu had been sending her friend requests, which Stella had ignored. Whenever he called, she would hang up and block him without hesitation.

Stella really didn’t want any more entanglements with Lu Mingxu. After contemplating for a few seconds, she decided to block him on WeChat as well, ensuring she wouldn’t see his friend requests again.

Perhaps because she was happy from the meal, the little cat system surprisingly began to tidy up the now-empty takeout containers on the table. 

As it cleaned, it hummed, “I’m just a little cat~ but I never shed fur~”

Although the scene seemed a bit fake and animated, Stella genuinely felt surprised and warmed by the system’s helpfulness. 

It made her feel like she wasn’t alone anymore and that she had a family member to look out for each other.

The next day was Children's Day, but unfortunately, as an adult, Stella couldn't celebrate the holiday like children could. Instead, she sat at her workstation, madly translating documents.

Until the afternoon, the system hadn’t issued the daily task. 

Just when Stella thought the system might be slow in releasing the task today, she heard the familiar voice as she stepped out of the office building. 

“Ding! Were you waiting anxiously? Come and claim today’s daily task!”

“Spend 10,000 yuan in 30 minutes!”

“I’ve been waiting for this!” Stella happily pulled out her phone and opened the food delivery app, ordering a five-person roast duck set from Quanjude just like yesterday. 

“Ding! Ding! Ding!”

The notification rang three times, and Stella thought it was the system reacting to her order, but then it continued, “Congratulations, Student Stella! You’ve been bound to the system for a week; now the weekly task begins—spend 500,000 yuan in one hour!”

Five hundred thousand!

Stella was utterly shocked, her expression failing to keep calm as her mouth hung open.

So she had been bound to the system for a week already!

She needed to think about what to buy with 500,000!

A car!

But she didn’t have a driver’s license and couldn’t drive at all; buying it would be pointless.

She could buy a 50-square-meter apartment in a prime location in a tier-five city! 

But she wasn’t planning to work in a tier-five city, so she wouldn’t even be able to live in it.

The weekly task came so suddenly that Stella found herself at a loss for what to buy.

She needed to calm down. Instead of standing there in distress over how to spend the money, it would be better to head to the nearby high-end store to search for her targets.

The highest-end store nearby was, of course, Jinghua Guomao!

Stella stepped out, her feet in her little red sneakers, and hurried across to the building opposite her office.

Once inside Jinghua Guomao, Stella opened a review app and quickly searched for the exact location of the “Xiang Nai Nai” clothing store in the mall.

In Stella’s mind, this brand’s clothing was the most expensive!

She was pinning her hopes on spending the 500,000 here!

As soon as she entered the store, a beautiful sales associate approached her with a polite inquiry about what she needed.

“I want to buy professional attire for work—something expensive!” Stella said, explaining that she was about to look for a new job and needed something nice for her interviews.

The sales associate paused momentarily; did “Xiang Nai Nai” have any inexpensive clothing?

However, she quickly realized that she had a big client in front of her.

Even though this customer’s outfit looked cheap, the sales associates in the Guomao store wouldn't judge people by their appearance. The stunning saleswoman smiled and said, “Ma’am, please follow me. We just released our Spring/Summer 2022 high-end ready-to-wear collection, which includes many professional styles that should meet your needs.”

The sales associate's gentle voice and warm tone calmed Stella's anxious heart a bit.

The first professional outfit the associate introduced was a yellow double-breasted herringbone soft wool blazer paired with a matching pencil skirt. 

Stella glanced at the price tag and nearly gasped: 63,500 yuan!

So expensive!

But it was exactly what she needed!

“This one is great! I’ll take it! Do you have any other recommendations?” Stella said eagerly.

“Um… ma'am, wouldn’t you like to try it on first?” the associate asked with a smile.

“No need, I can try it on after I buy it. Let’s move on to the next one,” Stella replied.

“Oh, alright.” The associate nodded, slightly taken aback.

The second outfit was a purple base black plaid cotton coat paired with a matching pencil skirt, priced at 60,200 yuan.

“Great! I’ll take this one too! What’s next?” 

“Okay,” the associate nodded.

The third outfit was a peacock blue and pink mixed long coat made of soft wool, falling just below the thigh, priced at 94,700 yuan.

“Wow, that’s pricey! I’ll take it! Next!” 

Stella was calculating on her phone; she was now approaching 220,000 yuan but still needed about 280,000.

No, it was 290,000.

She had to account for the remaining daily task funds as well.

The fourth outfit was a black base color short-sleeve top with colorful prints paired with an open-back tie dress, priced at 36,500 yuan.

Wait, why did the price drop so much all of a sudden?

“I’ll take this one too. Can you introduce me to something a bit pricier?” Stella suggested.

“Uh, sure,” the associate replied, slightly confused about why the customer wanted even more expensive items.

“Maybe you could show me some bags?” the associate proposed.

Stella’s eyes lit up. Of course! The bags at “Xiang Nai Nai” are super expensive!

“Alright, show me,” Stella nodded.

The associate then presented four bags that matched the four outfits she had selected.

The first was a light yellow lambskin handbag priced at 40,100 yuan. 

The second was a purple grain-embossed shiny Maxi classic handbag priced at 71,500 yuan. 

The third was a small black sequined metallic bag priced at 35,300 yuan.

The fourth was a large white retro cowhide handbag priced at 67,500 yuan.

“I still need 39,805 yuan…” Stella muttered.

“What? I’m sorry, could you please repeat that?” the associate asked, having missed what the customer had said.

She had to treat this big client with utmost seriousness!

“Can you show me some shoes? Ideally, I want to make sure I hit that 39,805 yuan,” Stella said.

So, the associate brought out four pairs of shoes for her.

The first pair was a pair of goat leather sandals priced at 8,700 yuan. 

The second was a pair of black leather flats priced at 8,300 yuan. 

The third was a pair of black rhinestone high-heeled sandals priced at 10,800 yuan. 

The fourth was a pair of black-and-white pointed sandals priced at 8,800 yuan.

After these, she still had 3,205 yuan left in her task funds. The associate then recommended a pair of butterfly-shaped 18k gold earrings, adorned with pink pearls and red rhinestones, priced at 4,900 yuan.

Because Stella had earlier asked to make sure she hit 39,805 yuan, the associate offered her a discount of 1,695 yuan, making it an even better deal.

Stella was grateful to the associate for not making her spend an extra penny, just enough to total 509,105 yuan, completing her task half an hour ahead of schedule.

But the associate was the one who should be thankful to Stella! 

Despite the many customers at the “Xiang Nai Nai” store in Jinghua Guomao, including those who spent millions, she had never encountered someone as easy-going and straightforward as Stella.
