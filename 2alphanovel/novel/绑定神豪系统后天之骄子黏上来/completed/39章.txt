**Insightful Eyes**

“Thank you for your next visit!” 

The fashion consultant, Xiao Wang, bowed to Stella Ling’s retreating figure. 

She must have had a pretty good day, right? Miss Ling should be satisfied, no?

Stella Ling stepped out of the LV store, juggling multiple bags. Although she had bought a lot, she had discarded the cumbersome boxes and packed everything into a few large bags, making it easier to carry.

As she got into the taxi, she noticed Xiao Wang watching her through the glass window of the store.

Stella waved at her. 

While she preferred Chanel's design style over LV's, the service attitude of this LV staff left a lasting impression on her. She thought that when her fortune increased again and she received another random task, she might consider shopping at this store once more.

Xiao Wang, noticing the customer waving goodbye, raised her hand in response. 

It seemed she had passed the test; Miss Ling would likely return.

Once home, Stella clicked on the system to draw her reward. 

The pointer spun wildly before finally stopping at the random cash reward section.

Upon claiming her reward, she was astonished to find she had won 1 million yuan in cash. 

This was ten times more than the random cash reward she had drawn the first time.

Earlier in the day, Stella had been pondering whether she would have enough money to start an entertainment company. 

And just like that, her fortune had come through for her.

She glanced down at the ruby ring on her right pinky. 

Last time she was at school to move her belongings and pick up a package, the fortune system had let her draw a space ring.

If one day she wanted to achieve immortality, would the system let her draw a potion for eternal life?

Stella chuckled at the thought; immortality was not on her agenda right now. 

What she really desired was a skill to conceal her luck. 

But when would that skill finally show up?

The next day at work, Stella chose the fourth LV outfit recommended by Xiao Wang as her commuting ensemble. 

Dressed so flamboyantly, she naturally attracted a flurry of gossip from her colleagues, and more and more of them were trying to get close to her.

However, she got along best with Jin Linghua, even though they had known each other for less than a week.

Stella loved listening to Jin Linghua discuss the entertainment industry.

She rarely followed the entertainment scene herself, so she often found herself just listening to Jin Linghua talk.

Jin Linghua started by discussing the latest trending topics in the entertainment industry, and then she began sharing her experiences as a fan in the Huan and Hua countries.

“What’s a ‘fan station’?” Stella asked, having never heard the term before.

“A fan station refers to fans who use high-end cameras to capture their idols, and it also refers to the organization and management of fan support groups for celebrities.”

Jin Linghua explained, continuing, “The first group I followed was the girl group Glitter from Huan Country. I initially followed the leader, but when they added a member from Hua—Yuan Fei—I switched my allegiance to her. I even traveled to Huan just to see my idol in person.”

“I taught myself photography and video editing to record all of Yuan Fei's amazing performances in Huan and uploaded them to various websites back in Hua, hoping to get more people to know about this Hua girl working in Huan and to encourage them to like her too. That’s how I became her fan station manager.”

“As Yuan Fei’s popularity rose in Hua, she became a hot commodity among major entertainment companies, and more fans in the country wanted her to return home. After all, who wouldn’t want more opportunities to meet their idol?”

At this point, Jin Linghua fell silent.

Stella had already heard the rest of the story from Jin Linghua the day before.

In Stella’s eyes, Yuan Fei was earning more than ever, which was a clear sign of success. Yet, for Jin Linghua, it represented the decline of her idol’s dreams.

“To be honest, I don’t like Yuan Fei as much as I used to. I just watched the idol drama she starred in last week.”

Jin Linghua paused, then exclaimed, “She was absolutely awful in it! Not only was her makeup terrible, but her acting was a disaster! I remember her being so vibrant on stage, and she never showed any signs of awkwardness in her music videos. Why did she turn into a clueless bimbo on screen?”

“I refuse to believe that someone who has never studied acting would improve just because she tries harder. There are people who have quietly honed their acting skills for years and still haven’t made it big. Why should I believe she can just soar to success based on talent alone? Does she even have that talent?”

“Plus, she’s taken on so many endorsements and performances. Does she really have time to work on her acting?”

“I’m genuinely worried that if she doesn’t return to where she belongs, she’ll end up like those former stars who faded away.”

“Xiao Xing, my admiration for Yuan Fei has shattered,” Jin Linghua said, looking utterly despondent.

While Stella couldn’t fully empathize, she understood the time, energy, and money Jin Linghua had invested in her fandom. 

It was only natural for Jin Linghua to feel disappointed as she watched her idol drift further away from the idealized image she once held in her heart.

If Stella were to open an entertainment company, she would need to carefully plan her artists' development paths to avoid disappointing their fans.

She remembered Jin Linghua mentioning that the Hua entertainment industry lacked stages. 

If she opened an entertainment company focused on stage performances, would it be lucrative?

Stella knew that if she wanted to establish a company dedicated to stage arts, she’d need to hire experts in that field.

But where would she find them?

Stella felt a headache coming on; there were undoubtedly many experts in Huan.

Was she really expected to go there to recruit people?

Two days passed in the blink of an eye. 

After pondering the expert hiring situation for two days, Stella still hadn’t come up with a solution.

Today was June 8th, and Stella had been linked to the system for two weeks now. 

This meant it was time for her weekly tasks to be released.

[Ding! Ding! I’m sending out two tasks at once!]

[Spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!]

[Spend 5 million yuan within 2 hours!]

“5 million!” 

Stella gasped in shock. 

She had just gotten off work and was already headed into battle for a shopping spree?

How was she supposed to spend 5 million yuan?

Jewelry seemed like a good option!

Stella made her way to the nearby Jinghua International Trade Center, but instead of entering the mall, she headed to a jewelry store nearby called Gem Cage. 

She often passed by this store when she visited the mall, and she was always captivated by the stunning jewelry posters displayed outside.

Upon entering the store, she was immediately greeted.

“Hello, welcome to the Gem Cage counter!”

The jewelry consultant, Xiao Sun, noticed the customer dressed in LV and realized she might be a lucrative client, so she hurried to approach her before anyone else could.

Stella glanced at the central display case, where a dazzling diamond and pearl necklace was showcased, and her breath caught in her throat.

95 million yuan! 

She definitely couldn’t afford that!

Quickly averting her gaze, Stella turned to the consultant who had approached her and asked, “Do you have any jewelry under 5 million?”

“Yes, we do! Are you looking to buy something close to that price point, or would you prefer to purchase several pieces? We also have items in the hundred thousand and several hundred thousand range,” Xiao Sun replied enthusiastically.

5 million! She must be a significant customer!

Stella pondered for a moment. 

If she bought a piece for 5 million, she wouldn’t dare wear it out for fear of being robbed. 

Buying something worth several hundred thousand would allow her to wear it with a bit more peace of mind.

“Then please recommend me a piece under a million, preferably several pieces that can form a set, totaling no more than 5.01 million,” Stella instructed.

“Sure, please follow me,” Xiao Sun responded.

Soon, she presented a peacock feather-themed jewelry set and introduced it: “Madam, this is our Plume de Pao peacock feather series. It includes a necklace, ring, earrings, and bracelet, with each piece priced in the hundreds of thousands. The total is 1,076,500 yuan.”

Wow, the first set already exceeded a million.

Stella gazed at the dazzling pieces made of countless round diamonds, growing fonder by the minute. “I’ll take it. Let’s settle this purchase first.”

“Alright!”

Xiao Sun beamed with excitement as she took the jewelry to process the payment.

After completing the transaction, the jewelry consultant swiftly presented the second set to Stella.

The second set was the Serpent Boheme water droplet series, consisting of a necklace, ring, and earrings, with a total price of 845,000 yuan. 

Stella adored the earrings, which were shaped like teardrops adorned with diamonds and surrounded by golden beads.

The third set was the Animaux owl series, featuring a ring and a necklace, with a total price of 908,500 yuan. 

Stella found this set particularly appealing because each piece was owl-shaped, reminding her of her adorable fortune cat.

Feeling a particular fondness for the owl design, Stella decided to buy the more expensive Animaux owl series, which also included a necklace and ring, totaling 2,216,000 yuan. 

With this fourth set of owl jewelry, Stella ended up spending an additional 36,000 yuan beyond her task budget, but she was more than happy about it.

She even put on the owl-themed jewelry set right there in the store.

Stella admired herself in the mirror inside the shop, gazing at the necklace around her neck.

The double-row of pearls was connected by a diamond-encrusted clasp, forming a delicate and stunning choker that complemented the owl-shaped pendant beautifully.

The owl pendant was crafted from platinum, encrusted with diamonds, and the whiskers seemed to quiver; the fur was intricately detailed, hanging from a sparkling blue tanzanite necklace.

What was most interesting about this necklace was that the owl pendant had a detachable design, allowing it to be worn as a brooch, effectively making it two pieces of jewelry.

Stella then twirled her right hand, admiring the double-headed cat ring she wore on her index finger.

Two diamond-encrusted platinum cats flanked a 12-carat cushion-cut blue tanzanite, looking both luxurious and adorable.

After spending over 5 million at the jewelry store, Stella became a VIP customer there and left with a generous collection of gifts from Xiao Sun.

“Fortune, do you think the necklace and ring look good on me? Doesn’t the cat head look just like you?” 

Stella cheerfully asked the system as she carried her bag of gifts. 

[The necklace is fine, but the ring isn’t! The double heads represent two cats; I’m one of a kind!] 

The system declared with an air of nobility.

“You’re indeed one of a kind!” Stella smiled in response.

Just then, her phone in the bag vibrated.

Stella pulled it out to see a WeChat message from Li Qicheng.

“Miss Ling, are you free right now?”

Stella glanced at the message and ignored it.

Now that she knew Li Qicheng was drawn to her by her overwhelming luck, she had no intention of giving him another opportunity to get close.

The reason she hadn’t deleted him from WeChat yet was that she feared he might come looking for her, just like Lu Mingxu did, if she did.

She didn’t want to meet either of them again, including the man she had encountered by the lake that day.

Once she left Jing City, Stella planned to delete Li Qicheng from her WeChat immediately.

As the CEO of Jinghua International Trade, he must be quite busy and likely wouldn’t have time to search for her in another city.

Stella felt that no matter how much the Heaven’s Chosen One was attracted by her strong luck, over time, that attraction would fade.

Just like long-distance couples whose relationships weaken over time, leading to natural breakups.

Back in her rented apartment, Stella changed out of her clothes and into her pajamas.

Before her eyes floated a circular disc divided into twelve sections.

Stella clicked to draw her weekly task reward.

This time, the pointer spun for a long time, as if deliberately building suspense.

Finally, it landed on the random skill reward area.

Stella’s heart raced a little as she began to think about her recent worries before claiming the skill reward.

“Congratulations, Xiao Xing! You have obtained the ‘Insightful Eyes’ entertainment industry limited edition!”

As the system congratulated her, Stella’s heart burst into celebratory fireworks. 

As expected, she could draw what she wanted, aside from the skill to conceal her luck!

With the Insightful Eyes skill, she would be able to analyze and discern a person's potential in various aspects simply by using it on them.

The version of Insightful Eyes she received was specifically tailored for the entertainment industry, allowing her to see someone's potential for success in that field.

This was exactly what Stella needed!

With this skill, she would clearly identify who had the capability to become an artist and which ordinary people had the potential to break into the industry.

However, like the sprint champion skill, this one had limitations: she could only use it for one hour each day.

Moreover, once activated, she couldn't turn it off until the hour was up; it would shut down automatically after the allotted time.
