**Worshiping the Fox Immortal?**

Lu Mingxu glanced once more at the dishes in front of Stella Ling. After confirming that they only had the effect of replenishing energy and blood, without any adverse effects in certain aspects, he let out a light sigh and started to eat.

The taste of the medicinal cuisine was quite good, but as soon as Lu Mingxu thought about its effects, his appetite immediately dwindled by half.

By the time Stella finished her portion, Lu Mingxu still had more than half of his left. With little appetite, he idly stirred the deer tail left in the stew bowl with his spoon, ultimately setting it down.

*“He’s so wasteful! If it were me, I would eat every last bite!”* the Celestial Fortune System complained to Stella Ling.

Stella silently agreed in her heart, but whether he finished it or not was his business; she wouldn’t interfere.

Afterward, Lu Mingxu gathered up all the utensils and placed them into a paper bag before stepping out of the hospital room and handing the bag to Liang Yang, who was waiting at the door.

Liang Yang clearly noticed that Lu Mingxu was in a bad mood, but he had something more important he wanted to ask.

“Lu Shao, is that really your sister-in-law in the hospital room?” 

Liang Yang still couldn’t believe it.

Out of curiosity, he had been standing by the door ever since Lu Mingxu entered, hoping to eavesdrop on their conversation. Unfortunately, the soundproofing of the room was too good; he hadn’t heard a single word.

Just as Lu Mingxu emerged, Liang Yang managed to catch a glimpse of his future sister-in-law through the slightly opened door. He was certain he wasn’t seeing things; the woman sitting on the hospital bed was clearly just an ordinary-looking woman!

In his eyes, she could even be described as unattractive!

“Yeah, that’s right.” 

When Lu Mingxu mentioned Stella Ling, his mood lightened a bit, a smile creeping into his eyes.

Liang Yang stared in disbelief and continued to ask, “Is your sister-in-law someone from the entertainment industry?”

“How could that be?” 

Lu Mingxu shot Liang Yang a reproachful glance, as if the entertainment industry were something beneath his notice. Then, with a hint of pride, he introduced, “Your sister-in-law is a top student from Beijing Foreign Studies University.”

As for Stella Ling’s background, Lu Mingxu only knew that much for now. He had no intention of digging deeper; after all, once they officially started dating, he would eventually learn everything about her.

Upon hearing this, Liang Yang confirmed that the woman in the hospital room was definitely not the artist Meng Fangfei that Huang Luxin had brought along. But when did Lu Shao get to know this woman? There hadn’t been any indications at all!

“Your sister-in-law’s education is quite impressive. When did you two meet?” 

“Why are you asking so many questions? Are you checking my household registration?” 

Lu Mingxu replied somewhat impatiently, but the next moment, he spoke in a tone filled with sweetness, “We met yesterday and it was love at first sight.”

Faced with the lovesick Lu Shao, Liang Yang’s jaw nearly dropped. He halted his instinct to step back and countered, “Lu Shao, do you still need me for anything?”

“Uh, can you take out the trash in your hand?” 

“And then?” 

“Then… that’s it, you can go.” Lu Mingxu thought for a moment before answering.

Initially, he wanted Liang Yang to pick up some fruits since the medical report indicated that Stella was lacking in vitamins. However, he quickly remembered that he could just order takeout, which would be faster.

Thus, Liang Yang left the hospital in a daze, carrying the trash bag.

On his way to Zhao Xuezhuzhu’s place, Liang Yang pulled out his phone and called a buddy who had been with him at the “Scenery” KTV last night.

“Xu Lin, what on earth happened last night at ‘Scenery’? Do you know that Lu Shao has someone he likes now?”

He fired off two questions as soon as the call connected.

“Didn’t I tell you everything last night?” 

Xu Lin replied, scratching his messy hair. “I was the one who told you that he likes Meng Fangfei!”

He was trying to catch up on sleep when the call woke him up.

“Absolutely not Meng Fangfei! Lu Shao’s crush is a college student, and she isn’t even pretty!” Liang Yang immediately retorted.

“Speaking of this college student’s looks, she’s really quite average! Compared to Lu Shao’s previous girlfriends, she’s leagues behind!” 

“But Lu Shao is crazy about her! He just told me that this college student is my future sister-in-law!” 

Liang Yang’s enthusiastic disclosure left Xu Lin stunned.

Then, as if recalling something, Xu Lin asked, “Is this college student around 1.6 meters tall, very ordinary-looking, and has her hair in a low ponytail?”

“I’m not sure about her height; she was lying in bed at the time, her hair was down, but she did look quite ordinary.” Liang Yang answered.

“What the hell! Lu Shao took her to bed?” 

Xu Lin was shocked by Lu Shao’s decisiveness!

“Bed! It was a hospital bed!” 

Liang Yang shouted into the phone, trying to dispel the inappropriate thoughts forming in Xu Lin’s mind.

“Hospital play?!” 

Xu Lin was even more shocked. “Could it be that Lu Shao hit her?”

“Impossible!” 

Liang Yang immediately dismissed that idea, continuing, “Lu Shao treasures that girl, and he never hits women!”

“Oh my! Oh my! Oh my!” 

Xu Lin was completely bewildered.

So, it turns out that Lu Shao wasn’t mistaking someone else for Meng Fangfei due to drunkenness last night! He genuinely liked the ordinary-looking stranger he had pulled into the private room!

A whole night had passed; Lu Shao couldn’t still be hungover, right?

Xu Lin struggled to digest the fact that Lu Shao had fallen for an ordinary-looking girl. 

What kind of taste was that? Had he downgraded?

Last night, Xu Lin thought Lu Shao was just drunk and mistook someone, but now it seemed like he had truly lost his mind!

Seeing that Xu Lin had fallen silent for a long time, Liang Yang broke the silence, asking, “Don’t you think this is odd? Do you think Lu Shao has been possessed?”

“Get out of here! Possessed people shouldn’t lack taste! Maybe he’s been cursed!” Xu Lin countered.

The two continued their conversation on the phone, with Xu Lin even detailing what had happened last night, but still, they couldn’t reach any conclusion that made sense.

When Liang Yang finally returned home, his dazed expression was noticed by Zhao Xuezhuzhu.

She immediately approached him, feigning concern, “What’s wrong? Did you mess something up and get scolded by Lu Shao?”

“Not at all! I’ve never made a mistake in my work! It’s just that he introduced me to a sister-in-law.”

As he spoke the latter part, Liang Yang looked completely bewildered.

“Ah?” 

Zhao Xuezhuzhu’s tone rose in surprise, and then her jealousy ignited like fire meeting oil.

Liang Yang had no older brother, so this sister-in-law could only be Lu Shao’s woman!

With a mix of bitterness and jealousy, Zhao Xuezhuzhu adjusted her expression, smiling as she asked, “That’s good news! But who is this sister-in-law? Is it Meng Fangfei?”

Which little vixen is it?! 

Wasn’t Lu Shao only looking for female companions?

Where on earth did this sister-in-law come from?!

Liang Yang hesitated to answer, and Zhao Xuezhuzhu, feeling anxious, prompted him several times before he finally recounted everything that had happened at the “Scenery” KTV and in the hospital that day.

He had been holding onto this information, feeling uncomfortable; besides Xu Lin, he needed to share and analyze it with a few more people.

After hearing Liang Yang’s account, Zhao Xuezhuzhu confirmed that Meng Fangfei was indeed not Lu Shao’s new love interest. No wonder Huang Lu had reacted that way after she sent a message!

However, a woman who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere had firmly captured Lu Shao’s heart, even making the fat pig beside her call her “sister-in-law”!

The most critical point was that Liang Yang said the woman was very ordinary, which didn’t match Lu Shao’s previous tastes.

Not just Liang Yang and his buddies, even Zhao Xuezhuzhu found something off about this situation.

After pondering for a moment, Zhao Xuezhuzhu leaned closer to Liang Yang and said, “Hey, darling, you know that some people in our circle will take shortcuts to get famous, right?”

“I’ve heard about it.” 

Liang Yang nodded, wrapping his arm around Zhao Xuezhuzhu.

“Don’t you think that woman might have some connections?” Zhao Xuezhuzhu pressed on.

“I’ve suspected it, but it still feels unlikely.” 

Liang Yang replied. He had heard from Xu Lin last night that Lu Shao was scratched by his future sister-in-law.

Today, when he saw Lu Shao, he had noticed the bruise on his face but didn’t say anything out of respect for him.

If that woman really used such tactics to approach Lu Shao, why make such a fuss? Wouldn’t it be better to just give in?

“Why not?” Zhao Xuezhuzhu asked curiously but felt frustrated that Liang Yang wasn’t biting.

Liang Yang explained his reasoning for not being suspicious.

Hearing this rationale, Zhao Xuezhuzhu rolled her eyes internally and seductively said, “But I heard people in the circle say that to confuse a specific person, someone who worships the Fox Immortal must have a medium. That woman scratching him might be a precondition for her charm to take effect!”

“However, before she scratched him, Lu Shao kissed her first,” Liang Yang stated cautiously.

Zhao Xuezhuzhu rolled her eyes again, persistently arguing, “That charm might have already taken effect, and to avoid suspicion, she’s just pretending to be a virtuous and chaste woman!”

“Uh, that could also be a possibility,” Liang Yang replied uncertainly, glancing at his girlfriend.

“Ah! You can’t be too careful about Lu Shao!” 

Zhao Xuezhuzhu pounced into Liang Yang’s arms and playfully insisted, “What if that girl really used some underhanded tactics? If you tell Lu Shao about your suspicions in advance, he can be on guard. If you need, I can help you find someone in the circle who knows about this to see if that woman really worshiped the Fox Immortal.”

Liang Yang thought it over and found that Zhao Xuezhuzhu had a point, so he nodded in agreement, “You’re right; let’s do it your way.”

Meanwhile, Stella Ling was unaware that she was being viewed as a woman with ulterior motives, using supernatural means to get close to Lu Mingxu.

At that moment, she was eating fruits while chatting casually with Lu Mingxu. Just recently, she had learned his name, and now Lu Mingxu was scrolling through her WeChat moments, asking in a slightly aggrieved tone whether she had restricted his access to her posts.

Swallowing a piece of banana, Stella explained, “No, I just never post anything.”

Upon hearing this, Lu Mingxu remembered that he had added her on WeChat using her phone earlier, and at that time, he hadn’t restricted her moment’s visibility.

Later, when Stella took her phone back, she only glanced at WeChat and then set it down without doing anything extra.

“Why don’t you post anything?” 

Lu Mingxu asked curiously, wondering if Stella might have another WeChat account that she didn’t use often.

“There’s nothing to post.” 

Stella answered truthfully.

Her life was so mundane; every day was either about studying or working. Not many happy things happened in her life, and she didn’t want to burden her only friend with her worries by posting bad news.

Though she never posted, she often browsed her friends’ moments to see their daily funny stories. 

Seeing others living well brought a sense of healing to her monotonous world.

Lu Mingxu was at a loss for words. 

Through their brief interaction, he realized that he and the person he liked had completely different personalities and interests.

He, for instance, posted at least two moments a day—not because he liked posting, but because so many interesting things happened around him each day.

Thinking about those fun experiences, Lu Mingxu suddenly stiffened and hurriedly opened WeChat to delete his posts. 

All those videos and photos where he was cuddling with female idols and stars, as well as those wild nights at bars with friends—they all had to go!

Those experiences were no longer fun stories but rather his dark history!

As he deleted, he broke out in a cold sweat, trying to erase everything before Stella could see those moments!

Once he had deleted those videos and photos, there was hardly anything left in his moments.

Lu Mingxu stared at what remained, took a deep breath, and relaxed his body, feeling as if he had just survived a disaster.

From now on, he, Lu Mingxu, decided to be a person of integrity!

Seeing Lu Mingxu fiddling with his phone, looking serious while staring at the screen, Stella thought he must be busy and said, “If you’re busy, you can go ahead. I can manage by myself.”

“No, I’m not busy! I can stay with you!” Lu Mingxu replied earnestly.

Stella felt a twinge of disappointment as she fiddled with her fingers; she didn’t actually need his company.

Lu Mingxu would be better off visiting the guy in the pink shirt he had sent to the hospital last night—he was the one who truly needed company!

Being in the same space as him was becoming increasingly awkward for her!

*“Xiao Xing, I have a way to make him leave!”* the system chimed in.

“What’s the way?” Stella’s eyes lit up.

*“Sleep!”*

No sooner had the system said this than Stella felt her mind grow heavy, and in the next moment, she lay back down on the hospital bed, fast asleep.

Having wrapped up his dark history, Lu Mingxu had initially wanted to continue chatting to know more about the girl he liked. However, he noticed that Stella had unknowingly fallen asleep.

Lu Mingxu approached the hospital bed, gently touched Stella’s forehead, and paused under her nose for a moment.

Confirming that Stella didn’t have a fever and showed no other abnormalities, he shifted his chair closer and sat down.

Lu Mingxu lowered his head, quietly admiring Stella’s sleeping face, unaware that a little system cat was observing him from the shadows.

*“Why isn’t he leaving yet? Xiao Xing is asleep; he can’t chat with you anymore!”* the system complained, only to see Lu Mingxu suddenly lean down and gently plant a kiss on Stella’s forehead.

*“You little rascal!”* the system yelled in a frenzy, but the sleeping Stella and the blushing Lu Mingxu couldn’t hear its cries.

The annoyed system thought that Lu Mingxu would just steal a kiss and leave it at that.

But to its shock, Lu Mingxu pulled out his phone and started taking a flurry of pictures of Stella’s sleeping face!

*“How outrageous! You wait for me!”* the system cried in frustration.

It was all its fault for suggesting such a terrible idea that allowed Lu Mingxu to take advantage of Stella!

It simply couldn’t understand why someone like Lu Mingxu met the standards of the Heaven’s Chosen Ones!
