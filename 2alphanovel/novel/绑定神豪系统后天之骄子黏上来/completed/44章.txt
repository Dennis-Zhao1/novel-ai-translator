**Black Gold Card**

Stella Ling didn't pay any more attention to the four girls. After settling the bill, she left BVLGARI directly. As she walked, she examined the shiny golden disk in her hand.

Among the rewards she received, there was a peculiar black card labeled as the "American Express Black Gold Card 5-Minute Usage Right." Stella had no idea what this was and immediately inquired with the Celestial Fortune System, "What is this?"

【If you click on that area, you can learn more about the specific information of this item.】

Stella followed the instruction, and in an instant, detailed information about the American Express Black Gold Card appeared before her eyes.

The American Express Black Gold Card is globally recognized as the "King of Cards." It is aimed at a top-tier clientele with no credit limit, primarily held by politicians, billionaires, and social elites across various countries, and is issued only through invitation from American Express—no online applications are accepted.

In Hua country, the American Express Black Gold Card is a cooperatively issued credit card, which means there are limits on it, with credit limits ranging from 30 to 50 million.

"So, if I draw this reward, I can buy anything I want with this card within five minutes?" Stella asked.

【That's right.】

"This is a credit card; once I use it, I don't have to pay it back, right?"

【Of course, it’s just like a 50 million yuan check.】

Stella's heart raced as she began to silently chant in her mind. She had to draw this American Express Black Gold Card!

Clicking the lottery button, the pointer spun rapidly before finally stopping straight at the section where the American Express Black Gold Card was located. 

Awesome!

Stella cheered internally; it was in moments like this that she truly felt her lucky streak. 

"50 million! What are we waiting for? I'm definitely renting a company space!" Stella declared decisively.

This black gold card could only be used for five minutes; as long as she didn’t claim the reward now and waited until payment time to claim it, the short usage time wouldn’t be a problem!

【Theoretically, that's correct, but you must claim the reward today, Stella. What if there's a random task tomorrow? If you keep delaying this reward, the Black Gold Card might get replaced by a random task that appears tomorrow! I might issue a task at midnight, you know!】 

Zhao Cai's voice came through, sounding like a little devil.

Stella was shocked. 

What? Why would it be like this? Zhao Cai, am I no longer your little angel? Does love just disappear like that?

Stella reminded herself to stay calm as she glanced at the emerald watch on her left wrist. It was now 11:30 AM, and she still had the entire afternoon ahead of her.

The company definitely couldn’t be based in Jing City. Not even in the Shanghai or Guangdong’s Sui City; those places were out of the question. 

Jing, Shanghai, and Sui are three of the most significant first-tier cities in Hua country, vital hubs for trade, economy, finance, and politics, with global influence. 

Stella didn’t want to set her company up in these crowded cities; she had her reasons, and no need to elaborate on them.

So, where should she go instead?

An entertainment company couldn't be too far behind; at the very least, it needed to be in a first- or second-tier city to facilitate future growth. And as the monetary values of the system tasks she accepted increased, she needed to reside in a luxury brand-filled metropolis—otherwise, where would she spend money to complete tasks? Surely she couldn't be online shopping every day? 

Time was pressing, and Stella felt her anxiety rising. 

In her nervousness, she suddenly realized she was hungry. 

So what if she was hungry? This wasn't the time to think about food.

Wait, how about opening the company in a city known for its food? 

When it came to cuisine, the first thing that popped into Stella's mind was Guangdong...

No, that had to be ruled out!

How about the capital city of Sichuan Province, Chengdu! 

The culinary capital of the world!

This was the place!

Having made her decision, Stella quickly hailed a cab to the airport. 

Once she arrived at the airport, she purchased a ticket for the next flight to Chengdu. 

The plane landed at Chengdu’s Capital Airport at around 3 PM. 

Stella was as anxious as an ant on a hot stove as she took a taxi to the rental company she had found while waiting at the airport. 

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at the Property Service Center of the International Financial Building located in Chengdu’s Jiangjin District. Speaking rapidly, she told the staff, “I want to rent a company space, the top floor here, the entire floor! I also want to rent two luxurious serviced apartments of 400 square meters each and another one of 260 square meters!” 

“Sure, ma'am. Let me take you to see the top floor of the International Financial Building,” the staff member replied.

“No need to see! I know this office building is great! I want to sign the contract today!” Stella quickly insisted.

“...Oh, alright. Please have a seat here while I prepare the documents!” 

The staff member was taken aback, muttering to herself that a god of wealth had descended from the heavens—she didn't even want to look at the property before signing. 

But honestly, there was no need to look. 

With a little background check, anyone could tell that this office building is one of the most high-end and influential landmark buildings in Chengdu.

The International Financial Building in Chengdu is among the first batch of super-class A office buildings, covering an area of 55,000 square meters, with a total construction area of about 760,000 square meters, composed of four towers and a podium, where Towers One and Two stand at 248 meters high, each with 50 floors.

It is a city complex integrating shopping, cultural entertainment, office spaces, serviced apartments, and hotels.

The International Financial Building has won awards such as the "VIVA Design and Development Award" from the International Council of Shopping Centers and the "LEED Existing Buildings Operations and Maintenance" Platinum Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.

With its many advantages, there was indeed no need for serious clients to view the property.

The area of the top floor was 3,000 square meters, with a monthly rent of 500,000 yuan. Stella planned to rent it for five years, totaling 31.5 million yuan, including the deposit. 

She also rented two luxurious serviced apartments of 400 square meters each and one ultra-luxurious 260 square meter presidential suite for five years, totaling 10.61 million yuan, including the deposit.

Stella intended to use the two serviced apartments for her company’s artists as dormitories and live in the ultra-luxurious presidential suite herself.

Even though spending this much on these three properties was a bit excessive, the Black Gold Card could swipe for up to 50 million yuan, so what if it was expensive?

Moreover, the Black Gold Card could only be used today and had to be claimed within five minutes, so Stella had no choice but to go for a longer rental and spend more.

The top floor of the International Financial Building was a trading floor, customizable according to the client’s needs, meaning that clients renting this floor could design and decorate it as they wished.

However, Stella didn’t plan to look for a separate renovation team. She decided to hand over the remaining 7.89 million yuan to the property management so they could provide her with a company renovation design plan and handle the renovations.

After signing the agreements, the staff at the property center brought out a special POS machine capable of processing a one-time transaction of 5 million yuan.

Stella reached into her stylish handbag, using it as cover to claim the Black Gold Card reward, and then swiped it on the POS machine ten times in a row. 

In less than five minutes, the full 50 million yuan limit of the Black Gold Card was completely used up.

What she didn’t know was that as the landlord, Manager Liu's eyes lit up upon seeing the Black Gold Card.

Could it be the American Express Black Gold Card?

Thinking of this, Manager Liu immediately took out his phone to check, and after confirming that it was indeed the American Express Black Gold Card, he was left in utter astonishment.

There were only 100 of these cards worldwide!

When did such an influential person come to Chengdu?

If it wasn’t for the fact that the credit limit of this card in Hua country was capped at 50 million yuan, Manager Liu guessed that Miss Ling might have outright bought the entire top floor of the International Financial Building! 

No, she could probably buy the whole building!

The holders of Black Gold Cards are all people with profound backgrounds and substantial financial power! 

Ling...

There doesn’t seem to be a powerful Ling family in Hua country, right? 

Could it be a Chinese family that developed abroad?

Manager Liu sighed inwardly, realizing his lack of knowledge about the upper echelons of society. 

But not knowing much was fine; he just had to remember not to neglect this Miss Ling. 

With that thought, Manager Liu approached with a smiling face and said, “Miss Ling, I just heard you mention that you want to rent the top floor for an entertainment company. Our property can also assist in company registration, so if you need it, you can leave that matter to us.” 

Hearing this, Stella's heart leapt with joy, and she quickly stood up to express her gratitude, “That would be great, thank you!”

What a stroke of luck; she thought she would have to stay in Chengdu for a couple of days.

After all, registering a company seemed quite troublesome.

“It’s no trouble at all! It’s a small matter! Having such an outstanding young entrepreneur like you settle in the International Financial Building is an honor for us in Chengdu!” Manager Liu praised.

“Uh, thanks for the compliment.” 

Stella felt a bit embarrassed inside.

Her company wasn't even up and running yet, and she was already being labeled an outstanding young entrepreneur. 

Manager Liu certainly knew how to flatter.

Then she thought, may his words come true and make Star Entertainment thrive!

After that, Stella entrusted the company registration to Manager Liu. 

She planned to register a sole proprietorship with a capital of 10 million yuan.

Now all she needed was to wait for the business license to arrive.

Since someone else was handling the registration, Stella flew back to Jing City that same day. 

The plane landed in Jing City around 10 PM. 

After a busy day, Stella felt exhausted but still gathered her energy, planning to stroll around the Sanlitun SOHO area to scout for potential talents for her entertainment company.

She wouldn’t be in Jing City for too long, so she needed to seize this time to recruit more talent from the entertainment industry to take with her to Chengdu. 

As Stella sipped her coffee to stay alert, she glanced at the entrance of nearby office buildings, hoping to spot some promising candidates.

Someone was coming!

A group of boys appeared, all wearing caps, and they seemed to have good physiques.

Stella felt disheartened. 

Although she couldn’t see their faces clearly, boys who could sign with a company as trainees must be handsome, right? 

She currently had a psychological barrier against attractive men and was a bit hesitant to approach them. 

Moreover, Stella only had plans to form a girl group for now; forming a boy group hadn’t crossed her mind.

Maybe it was better to let it go. 

【Stella, I just checked; you can relax. Those boys are all poor and have undergone plastic surgery—they definitely don’t count as Heaven’s Chosen Ones.】 

Zhao Cai suddenly chimed in with a reminder.

“...Zhao Cai, your words are so harsh.” 

Stella muttered under her breath, this little kitty was so mean! 

【I’m just speaking the truth!】 

Zhao Cai retorted.

Realizing that none of the boys in the group were Heaven's Chosen Ones, Stella activated her Insightful Eyes and scanned them. 

“6.7 points, 8.2 points, 7.2 points, 9.1 points!”

Stella was taken aback; the potential was impressive! 

She had three more to check, so she continued using her skill: “7.1 points, 6.4 points, 6.5 points.” 

“Perfect! My target today is that one with 9.1 points!” 

With that, Stella settled her bill and stepped out of the café.

In Stella's eyes, cosmetic surgery was not a flaw at all. 

She had learned from Linghua that there wasn’t a single artist in the entertainment industry who hadn’t undergone some form of surgery; even her ultimate idol, Yuan Fei, had done it. 

Even naturally beautiful artists would go for minor adjustments through injections.

She had even considered that if her company recruited artists who lacked looks but had high potential scores, she would send them to reputable beauty clinics for enhancements.

She wouldn’t let them undergo risky surgeries, as those types of procedures could be dangerous, potentially leading to serious injury or even death!

She would only allow subtle adjustments that could make their looks more appealing. 

Ultimately, artists needed to rely on their talent to gain fame. 

The image of relying solely on looks was not what Star Entertainment aimed for with its artists.

Stella quickly approached the group of boys but noticed they were increasingly quickening their pace, and a few of them occasionally looked back toward her. 

Stella gradually fell behind and had to run, shouting, “Hey, the boy in the red shirt, wait up! I need to talk to you!” 

To her surprise, just as she started running, one of the boys shouted, “Run! The sasaeng fan is coming after us!” 

Following that, the group of boys took off in a hurry, with some shouting, “Yu-ge, that person seems to be your sasaeng fan!” 

“Don’t worry about it, let’s hurry! We can’t let outsiders see us now!” 

Ren Xinyu pressed his cap down, replying as he ran. 

He had just had his double eyelids done, and they hadn’t fully healed yet!

No matter if she was a sasaeng fan or just a regular fan, he couldn’t let anyone see him in his imperfect state!

He should have had his manager drive them back to the dorm!

Seeing that the boys were fleeing without paying her any attention, Stella was so anxious that she nearly activated her hundred-meter champion skill. 

If it weren’t for the lingering aftereffects of that skill, she would have shown those boys what a world champion's speed looked like!

“I’m not a sasaeng fan!” Stella shouted in explanation. 

She understood the term sasaeng fan, as Linghua had told her about it.

After chasing for five minutes, Stella, out of breath, could only sit on the ground, watching the group of boys run further away.

“I’m the president of an entertainment company…” 

Stella sighed, exhausted and nearly in tears.

“Are you alright?” 

At that moment, a hoarse female voice reached Stella’s ears. 

Looking up, she saw a figure above her with a bright shining score of 9.6 floating above her head!
