**Triple Task Activation**

Before she knew it, June 15th had arrived—the day Stella Ling officially left her job. With a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her colleagues, including Zhang Aiyue, Jin Linghua, and others, before turning away from the company for the last time. As she stepped out of the office building, she glanced back one final time at the place where she had interned for three months.

During her time there, Stella had consistently exceeded her translation quotas, which led her supervisor to notify her during lunch that she could pack up early and head home. Raising her wrist, she checked the elegant emerald green watch adorning her arm, the dial showing it was now 12:05 PM. With no more work obligations, she decided to fly straight to Rong City to check on the company’s renovations. After all, she could stay in the luxurious presidential suite she had previously rented.

Around 4 PM, Stella arrived at the top floor of the International Financial Building in Rong City. She watched the renovation workers for about ten minutes when suddenly, a flurry of notifications pinged on her phone from the Celestial Fortune System.

**[Today's daily task is issued: Spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!]**  
**[It’s time for the weekly task: Spend 10 million yuan within 4 hours!]**  
**[Random task triggered: Spend 7.5 million yuan within 3 hours!]**  
**[Hehe, it’s a triple activation today!]**

Stella was stunned. Reacting as if she were escaping a fire, she sprinted to the elevator doors, pressing the button to summon the lift. When the doors slid open, she was shocked to find Manager Liu inside.

Upon seeing Stella, Manager Liu’s face broke into a broad smile. “Miss Ling! Why didn’t you let me know you were coming to Rong City? Are you here to check on the renovations? How do you like it? Is there anything that needs improvement?”

Stella stepped into the elevator, feeling a bit embarrassed. “It looks great! No need for further changes, Manager Liu. I have something urgent to take care of now; let’s chat later.”

Unexpectedly, Manager Liu didn’t exit the elevator. Instead, he pressed the button to close the doors and proceeded to ask, “What’s the urgent matter? Perhaps I can assist you.”

“I need to spend money!” Stella blurted out, her frustration spilling over.

Manager Liu was momentarily taken aback. “…”

Realizing her bluntness, Stella felt a bit sheepish. “I’m sorry, Manager Liu. I have a tendency to shop impulsively; I just love to buy things.”

Hearing this explanation, Manager Liu felt even more uneasy, lamenting that such a luxury was a disease only the wealthy could afford. Nonetheless, he smiled and suggested, “Well, you can shop here. Our International Financial Building is a comprehensive commercial complex with many international brands and boutiques.”

“Is there a place to buy cars? I want to purchase a few good business vehicles for our artists,” Stella inquired, her mind racing with ideas about how to utilize the funds from the tasks. 

“Actually, there isn’t a car dealership here, just a car wash,” Manager Liu replied thoughtfully. “But there’s a 4S dealership nearby. I’m friends with the owner. If you need, I can contact him right away to arrange for the best cars.”

“That would be great!” Stella responded with a smile. “I don’t need anything too extravagant. I plan to spend 17.5 million yuan on three business vehicles—one for regular use, so please prepare accordingly. However, I need the business vehicles to be top-of-the-line.”

Although Stella wasn’t well-versed in cars, she knew some could be outrageously priced, so she wanted to set her budget upfront. Manager Liu’s smile faltered for a moment. “…Okay, I understand. I’ll notify my friend right now. Let’s head over.”

Seventeen point five million yuan! 

In his entire life, he had never driven a car that cost over 2 million. Watching Stella spend such vast sums without batting an eye, he couldn’t help but marvel at the power of someone wielding a black American Express card. But no matter how extravagant Stella seemed, she was still running a business, which meant she was likely in it for profit. 

Is the entertainment industry truly this lucrative? Spending so much just on initial investments!

Then, Stella and Manager Liu took the elevator down and exited the International Financial Building. 

At the Tengfei 4S dealership, the salespeople were taken aback when the usually elusive General Manager Peng Lide hurried into the store. He called out to the nearest salesperson, “Quick! Get your sales manager over here! We have a VIP guest arriving soon!”

After delivering this command, Mr. Peng straightened his clothes and sternly instructed the sales team, “Make sure your appearances are neat! No joking around—show me the best spirit of an automotive salesperson! Understood?”

“Understood!” The sales team responded loudly, quickly tidying themselves up.

Who could this VIP be? They had never seen Mr. Peng act this way!

Sales Manager He Yan rushed in, followed closely by Sales Director Zhang Xiaoguang. Upon her arrival, Mr. Peng gave her a thorough briefing, emphasizing the importance of serving the VIP well. He turned to Zhang Xiaoguang and said, “You don’t need to tag along. You’ve been a director for years; you probably forgot all the sales scripts. Just let Xiao He handle the introductions.”

“Mr. Peng, what if this esteemed guest wants to build a long-term relationship with our dealership? Establishing good rapport, analyzing customer needs—this is part of my job,” Zhang Xiaoguang quickly countered.

Mr. Peng paused, considering the point, then relented. “Alright, you can come along too.”

With that, Mr. Peng positioned himself at the entrance, with Zhang Xiaoguang and He Yan following closely behind. Zhang Xiaoguang leaned in, curiosity piqued. “Mr. Peng, who exactly are we expecting? What do they do?”

Knowing more about the client’s background would help him tailor the sales approach effectively.

“It’s the president of a yet-to-open entertainment company. She’s a woman, and I’ve heard her background is quite impressive,” Mr. Peng recalled from a message sent by a friend.

Zhang Xiaoguang mulled it over. An entertainment company, female—this last bit of information seemed vague. If her background weren’t substantial, Mr. Peng wouldn’t be this anxious, nor would he rush to the dealership personally.

After a few minutes of anticipation, a young woman in her thirties entered the dealership. The moment she stepped inside and saw the lineup of staff awaiting her, she looked taken aback. 

“Wow, is this the kind of service you get at a 4S dealership now?” she thought, marveling at the reception she had never experienced before.

Mr. Peng had just mentioned the VIP was a woman, and Zhang Xiaoguang quickly realized the bewildered young man who had just walked in was not their intended client. He swiftly signaled a nearby female salesperson to attend to him instead.

Seeing this, Mr. Peng let out a sigh of relief. Despite running over a dozen 4S dealerships and facing many challenges, he had never encountered a client of this caliber before—especially someone with a black American Express card.

Previously unaware of such a credit card’s existence, he learned that only 100 of these exclusive cards had been issued worldwide, reserved for the elite, symbolizing wealth and status. Only by invitation from American Express could one obtain this card, making it all the more exclusive.

Imagining what kind of person could possess such a card, Mr. Peng felt his nerves heighten, swallowing hard as he stood by the entrance.

Zhang Xiaoguang and He Yan noticed Mr. Peng’s unusual demeanor, their own anxiety spiking. The atmosphere in the dealership grew tense and silent, as if they were under a spell.

After what felt like an eternity, Mr. Peng finally spotted his friend Liu Dengfeng entering, accompanied by a woman with fair skin and an ordinary appearance. 

Once inside, Mr. Peng immediately plastered on a welcoming smile, leading his capable assistants toward them. After a round of polite handshakes and small talk, Stella quickly expressed her urgency in buying cars, prompting them to move swiftly to the vehicle introductions.

With a warm smile, He Yan inquired, “Miss Ling, what are your requirements for the cars?”

“I’d like to start with three business vehicles, preferably high-end models,” Stella replied, then asked, “How much do your best-configured business vehicles cost?”

“Our top-tier business vehicle is the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, this year’s latest MVP model, which has undergone luxury upgrades by KLASSEN. The total price is 3.5 million yuan,” He Yan explained.

KLASSEN is a well-known brand in the liquor country, famous for its perfectionist approach to luxury vehicle interiors.

While He Yan spoke, she led Stella toward the car. However, Stella cut in before she could finish. “Let’s take three, all paid in full. I haven’t secured my temporary residence permit in Rong City yet, so don’t worry about the plates for now.”

“…Understood,” He Yan responded, a bit taken aback before quickly regaining composure. “Would you like to see the vehicle first? I can provide a detailed introduction.”

“Let’s just purchase it. You mentioned it’s the latest and the best; I can learn about it later,” Stella replied.

With only seven minutes remaining until her daily task deadline, any further delays would force her to use her task funds for online shopping instead. Noticing Mr. Peng signaling behind her to keep it short, He Yan promptly said, “Alright, please follow me.”

Five minutes later, Stella swiped her card, completing a purchase of 10.5 million yuan, fulfilling both her daily and random tasks. 

Now with 7.01 million yuan left and over three and a half hours to complete her weekly task, she turned to He Yan and said, “Let’s move on to the Mercedes Sprinter I just bought.”

“Of course,” He Yan agreed with a smile, internally questioning the service process being entirely out of order. 

They arrived at a stunning black, extended luxury business vehicle that exuded power and elegance. 

“Miss Ling, this is the Mercedes Sprinter you just purchased. It’s the latest MVP model by Mercedes and a favorite among stars, wealthy individuals, and business tycoons,” He Yan elaborated.

“This Sprinter has been luxuriously upgraded inside and out by KLASSEN, making it more comfortable and adding many new features, including a PlayStation 5 gaming console,” she continued, opening the door and retrieving a controller to hand to Stella, while pointing at the oversized onboard television.

Stella didn’t know much about gaming consoles but thought that since Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng might get bored in the car, they would enjoy playing games to pass the time. 

“Because this is the extended version, it’s significantly longer than standard Sprinters, measuring over 6.5 meters. Thus, reflective warning lights typically found on trucks have been added to the sides,” He Yan explained.

“The exterior has been completely upgraded, with the front grille replaced by the AMG black chrome grille, giving it a youthful and sporty appearance, rather than resembling a truck. The signature three-pointed star has been replaced with the KLASSEN emblem, and the entire bumper has undergone a blacked-out treatment. The front diffuser was designed and installed by KLASSEN, and the exhaust outlets have been swapped for AMG’s signature angular tips, with the taillights redesigned by KLASSEN as well.”

He Yan opened the trunk, continuing her detailed presentation. “The trunk is spacious and roomy. Underneath the mats, there’s a board that can be combined with the small table inside to create a larger working surface.”

“There’s an additional horizontal bar on the ceiling for hanging clothes,” she added.

“From the trunk, you can visually appreciate just how spacious the interior is.”

He Yan invited Stella to sit inside the vehicle. 

“All the seats can recline, and there’s a button on the side to extend the leg rests, which will automatically rise, but you can adjust the angle yourself.”

As she pressed the button, the seats began to recline as described.

“There are also two buttons for seat ventilation and heating, and in front, there’s a digital touchscreen where you can change the ambient light and adjust the air conditioning temperature. The ceiling lights’ colors can also be modified here, as can the ambient lights above the side windows.”

He Yan pressed buttons, demonstrating how the vehicle’s lights changed colors in response.

“This control system resembles a bar counter, complete with extra lighting below and several glasses stored inside,” she continued.

“The vehicle is equipped with a state-of-the-art air conditioning system, different from regular cars. It can cool or heat the interior independently, allowing it to drop the temperature by several degrees within seconds, perfect for the hot summers in Rong City.”

“Here’s a metal remote for the onboard TV. You can use it to turn on the television and pair it with the PS controller for gaming entertainment during long drives.”

“There’s also a hidden center console between the two seats that can be pulled out with a button press. On the center console, there are two foldable tabletops, which I mentioned earlier. The additional board in the trunk can be placed on top of these tabletops, creating a complete surface for work or dining, with curtains on all the windows that can be manually drawn.”

“The car can seat up to seven, with the last row accommodating three people. Each seat has its own armrest, ensuring no one feels cramped. There’s also a Berlin Sound surround system around the seats, along with storage drawers that pop out at the press of a button.”

“Additionally, there are USB charging ports and extra cup holders along the sides.”

Overall, it felt like a luxurious mobile office. Aside from the absence of a bathroom, this lavishly modified Mercedes Sprinter was practically perfect!
