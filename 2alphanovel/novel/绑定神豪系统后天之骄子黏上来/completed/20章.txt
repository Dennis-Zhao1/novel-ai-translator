**Translation:**

Stella Ling effortlessly finished a day's worth of work in just one hour, leaving her colleagues around her desk in shock at the towering stack of documents she had completed.

"What's up with Stella? Did something happen to her?" one colleague remarked, raising an eyebrow.

"Who knows? It might have something to do with that day she went to the police station," another added.

"I asked her about that incident this morning, and she said she’s fine now," someone chimed in.

"Of course, she’ll say she’s fine in front of us outsiders. Who knows what her true mental state is? But I'm more worried about how quickly she's translating. She’s bound to make a bunch of mistakes when she reviews them later," another voice noted.

"Yeah, it's possible that even Manager Zhang, who usually loves her work, might end up scolding her," came the response.

At that moment, Stella, completely in the zone, was oblivious to the chatter around her. She was immersed in a state of profound clarity. Ever since she obtained the proficiency skill in Han language, the documents in front of her seemed to translate themselves into Chinese, allowing her to type directly on her computer without a hint of difficulty. It felt like a breeze, and she was brimming with confidence in her skills. She resolved to seek out translation work with a higher level of complexity next; after all, typing from documents every day was rather dull.

Cough, cough—pride was sneaking in, wasn’t it? It was always better to remain humble.

Stella had already sent a portion of the translated documents to her colleague in charge of reviewing them, Yang Lan. However, when Yang Lan took the documents from Stella, her expression was anything but pleased. 

"She finished translating all this so quickly? I’m going to have a lot of corrections to make!" Yang Lan thought, frowning. This was a girl who had been diligent and reliable. How had she transformed in just two days? If there were too many mistakes when she checked them, she would definitely have to talk to Stella—she couldn’t let her slack off like this!

With a sense of dissatisfaction, Yang Lan opened the file and began her review. She meticulously searched for translation errors, and before she knew it, she had flipped through three pages of dense text, only to find not a single mistake. Not only that, but some of the translations were even more professional than what she had anticipated, prompting her to consult her dictionary just to confirm their accuracy.

The more she reviewed, the more astonished she became. She spent the entire morning examining the translations Stella had completed in just one hour. By the time she was done, she was utterly shocked.

With the pile of translated documents cradled in her arms, Yang Lan rushed over to Stella’s workstation. Just as her colleagues were gearing up for a show, they were taken aback when Yang Lan exclaimed, “Stella, you are amazing! Did you go to some elite translation agency for training? How did your skills improve so much?”

“No, I was just a bit lazy before and didn’t put in enough effort. Now I want to take my work seriously,” Stella replied, laughing.

Little did Stella know, her humble response sounded to Yang Lan like the boastful words of a powerhouse, igniting both envy and jealousy. Yang Lan’s tone turned slightly sour as she said, “You called that lazy? What does that make the rest of us—slackers?”

Stella felt a bit awkward. “I didn’t mean it like that…”

Yang Lan wasn’t looking for a fight; she quickly waved her hand. “Okay, I know you didn’t mean anything by it! But I probably won’t be able to review all these translations today.”

“I have confidence in your translation skills, and I really want to just let you pass,” she sighed. However, she understood that was out of the question—reviewing translations was her job. If Stella made a critical error and Yang Lan, trusting her, failed to review, they would both face the consequences.

But the speed at which Stella was translating was clearly beyond Yang Lan's usual workload, so they would need to talk to their manager, Zhang Ai Yue, about it.

After hearing about the situation, Zhang Ai Yue felt even more regretful about Stella leaving the company. But it was evident that the company couldn’t provide the advancement opportunities Stella sought. She wanted promotions in translation, not a direct transfer to the marketing department; her skills didn’t lie in that area.

Thus, Zhang Ai Yue had no choice but to let Stella go.

“How about this? Since you, Xiao Yang, say Stella’s translations are excellent, your review team will be in charge of her translations until the 15th of next month,” Zhang Ai Yue instructed.

“Sounds good,” Yang Lan nodded. Their review team had three members, which should be sufficient.

By the time lunch break officially rolled around, the colleagues in the marketing department’s translation team learned about Stella’s impending departure. Initially, they had been a bit displeased with Stella’s abrupt display of translation prowess, but once they learned she would be leaving next month, their irritation evaporated, and they began to chat and laugh with her.

Since Stella would no longer be a competitor within the department, there was no need for hostility; after all, having more friends meant more opportunities. Who knew—when they moved on from this job, they might even seek her help when looking for new positions.

Moreover, everyone had witnessed Stella’s true translation abilities today. The job she found after leaving would likely be even better than her current one, so they needed to handle their relationship with this former colleague carefully and maintain a solid connection.

Faced with her suddenly enthusiastic colleagues, Stella felt a bit overwhelmed. After lunch, she noticed five new contacts added to her phone, which made Wang Lingling beside her a bit envious. 

It wasn’t that Wang Lingling wanted to add those colleagues; she just couldn’t stand seeing someone like Stella, who should have been unnoticed, suddenly gain popularity among her coworkers.

However, she thought that after some time, those colleagues would be even more enthusiastic in their flattery of Stella.

With that in mind, Wang Lingling turned her face away, gazing dreamily across the street at the office building through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Li Qicheng, oh Li Qicheng. Since you’ve reached a collaboration with the company for me, why don’t you just come find me directly?

Just as Stella finished translating a document, she noticed Wang Lingling was gazing out the window again, lost in thought. She followed her gaze but found no man with binoculars across the way.

It seemed that the guy had only looked once—he didn’t appear to be some sort of peeping Tom.

【Ding! I’m here to release today’s daily task!】 

The system’s youthful voice echoed in her mind.

“But I’m working right now…” Stella replied, feeling a bit helpless.

【But releasing tasks is my job too…】 

【Today’s daily task is to spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!】

The system mimicked Stella's tone of complaint before eagerly announcing the task.

Stella groaned and stood up from her workstation, darting out of the department toward the restroom. 

Since she couldn't go shopping during work hours, she might as well do some online shopping instead. 

She couldn’t let the system's free money go to waste.

Now, she just had to think about what she still needed to buy.
