**Merit**

Stella Ling was busily selecting an outfit for a casual dinner gathering. 

After trying on several outfits, none of which satisfied her, she felt each was too formal for the occasion. Stella understood it was just a small get-together, and she could wear something more casual. But the moment she thought about the possibility of Li Qichen being there, she couldn't help but reach for the more formal attire typically reserved for grand banquets.

Giving up on her own selection process, Stella turned to her assistant and said, "Can you help me pick something more casual?"

The assistant replied, "Sure..." internally grumbling. Hadn't she just picked something that he rejected? Now he wanted her to choose again.

Resigned, the assistant helped her find a suitable outfit. After three rejections, they finally settled on a fourth option that received a slight nod of approval from Stella.

Once dressed, Stella was fastening a pair of emerald cufflinks onto her black shirt when she asked her assistant, "Have you resolved the trending topic issue?"

"Yes, it was taken care of this morning. Here, take a look at the clarification video," the assistant replied, handing her a tablet.

It was strange; even though their boss had been slandered online, he seemed unconcerned about it. He had spent the entire afternoon sighing at WeChat, as if he had encountered a more pressing issue.

The video revealed the footage that clarified the facts. However, upon seeing the last scene, a flash of anger crossed Stella’s light-hued, almond-shaped eyes. She turned to her assistant and said coldly, "Remove the woman who appears in the last scene of the video, and delete that segment entirely. We can't leave any traces online."

"O-Okay! I’ll take care of it right away!" the assistant stammered, startled by her sudden fury.

Since when did the usually amiable boss get so angry? The tech department had purposely left that segment in to highlight the malice of Meng Yan Han Xia, but who would have thought she would dislike it so much?

"Wait a moment," the assistant was called back as she reached the door.

"What is it?" she asked, bracing herself for more instructions.

"Dig deeper into that female influencer. If she has any incriminating evidence, collect it all and submit it to the police," Stella ordered, her tone icy.

The assistant felt a chill run down her spine. It seemed that this influencer had truly crossed the line with their boss to warrant such an extreme response. But then again, she had it coming!

"Boss, some netizens have already uncovered your identity. If we continue digging into the influencer's background, won't it make people think you're being too ruthless?" the assistant suggested cautiously.

"Don’t worry about what they think. Just do as I say." Stella brushed off the concern, adjusting her collar with indifference.

"Understood." The assistant nodded, knowing she had no choice but to follow her boss's orders. Besides, if they uncovered enough evidence against the influencer to qualify as a crime, it would be her own fault for breaking the law. She was merely bringing her past actions to light, not spreading rumors.

Still, the assistant felt uneasy. She worried that once the public saw the influencer's continuous negative exposure, they would view the Li family as overly cold-hearted. The discussion might spiral into class-related insults, branding the Li family as capitalists or worse.

It seemed necessary to create a narrative that painted the influencer as a casualty of her own actions, avoiding the impression that Stella was the mastermind behind it all.

At six o'clock that evening, at the Lingyan Building, a sleek black Maybach S680 pulled up outside.

Stella stepped out of the car, straightening her attire and taking a few deep breaths before entering the building. Given the sizable number of attendees, she had reserved the entire Lingyan Building for the dinner.

As soon as she walked in, she was greeted by Manager Park of "Bai Xue" cosmetics, who had been waiting at the entrance for who knows how long. He approached her enthusiastically, struggling with his Mandarin as they exchanged pleasantries.

Stella casually responded, following him toward their reserved room. 

Once inside, she quickly scanned the room, hoping to see a familiar face. But to her dismay, the one person she had been looking forward to seeing was absent.

Before she could voice her disappointment, Manager Park called over two young women and introduced them. "Stella, this is Zhang Aiyue, the head of our marketing department, and this is our translator, Wang Lingling."

Stella glanced at the young woman in a soft yellow dress standing beside Zhang Aiyue, then turned back to inquire, "Is Ling Xiaoxing here?"

"Uh, um..." Zhang Aiyue froze momentarily. "Oh, she took a leave of absence today due to some matters."

"What kind of matters? Is she feeling unwell? How was she when she left?" Stella shot out three questions in rapid succession.

A wave of anxiety washed over her. What if Xiaoxing found out about her following her that day?

Seeing Stella's anxious expression, Zhang Aiyue quickly reassured her, "No, she didn't show any signs of illness. She likely just had things to take care of."

"I can call her and ask her to come over," she offered, reaching for her phone.

Stella immediately stopped her, "No need! If she has something to do, let's not bother her." 

Her heart was heavy with disappointment for not seeing Xiaoxing, coupled with the fear of her discovering what Stella had done. She felt foolish for not approaching Xiaoxing in a more thoughtful manner; instead, her impatience had led to the scandal involving the influencer and the subsequent online exposure.

Zhang Aiyue, sensing Stella's unease, couldn't help but pry further, "So, do you know Xiaoxing?"

"Yes, we're friends," Stella replied with a smile, adding, "The rumors online were actually told to me by her."

Wang Lingling, who had been quietly observing, suddenly couldn't hold herself back. She interjected loudly, "But I was the one who discovered the video! I told Ling Xiaoxing about it! I even notified other colleagues to help!"

How dare that woman take credit for my discovery! And how could she know Li Qichen?

Stella's eyes widened in surprise as she watched Wang Lingling act so impulsively, shattering her composure. Zhang Aiyue quickly leaned in, tugging at Wang Lingling’s sleeve, urging her to keep quiet.

Stella felt embarrassed for both of them. Li Qichen had just said that Xiaoxing informed him about the video, even going so far as to say they were friends. How could they contradict him?

Realizing the revelation about Xiaoxing's identity as the praised colleague from Jinghua, Zhang Aiyue couldn't help but think that perhaps Li Qichen was intentionally keeping it under wraps to surprise Xiaoxing.

Stella smiled at the overzealous Wang Lingling and calmly stated, "I know. Xiaoxing mentioned that her colleague discovered the video, but she sent it to me directly on WeChat. She helped me out."

Wang Lingling felt an upsurge of frustration. She wanted to shout that she was the first to find that video! Why was all the credit going to Xiaoxing?

Did she not contribute at all? She had left hundreds of scathing comments on Meng Yan Han Xia's video! Xiaoxing only got ahead because she had Li Qichen's WeChat! If Wang Lingling had it too, she would have sent the video directly to him!

She felt aggrieved, wondering why reality was unfolding so differently from her expectations.

Manager Park blinked, looking between them in confusion. What were they talking about? Could they please slow down? He couldn't follow the conversation!

Since Xiaoxing was absent, Stella continued chatting with Manager Park in international English for a while before excusing herself, citing she had other matters to attend to and leaving the Lingyan Building.

Once back in the car, she turned to her assistant and asked, "Is the video issue resolved?"

"Yes, that part has been deleted," the assistant confirmed.

As the driver started the car, Stella instructed, "Don't take me to the villa yet. Head to the Beijing Foreign Language Institute."

"Understood, ma'am," the driver replied.

…

Meanwhile, Ling Xiaoxing was busy viewing apartments with her landlord.

The apartment she was considering was located in the heart of Beijing, in a community called Sunshine Huajing. It was a spacious 151 square meter high-rise that offered three bedrooms, two living rooms, and two bathrooms, directly rented from the landlord.

"Look at this great location! The park is right next door. If you want to exercise, it’s super convenient!" the landlord enthusiastically pointed out.

"The apartment is fully furnished with all new appliances. The monthly rent is only 30,000 yuan, with a one-month deposit and three-month prepayment. If you’re satisfied, we can sign the contract today, and you can move in right away."

"Sounds good, I’ll take it," Xiaoxing nodded in agreement.

She had just gone through the apartment with the landlord, checking every corner and all the appliances. Confirming that everything was new and fresh, she felt content with her decision.

"Great! Let’s sign the contract!" the landlord exclaimed, her smile wide as she pulled out two copies of the agreement from her bag.

After signing, Xiaoxing immediately transferred 120,000 yuan to the landlord's account, who beamed even brighter upon receiving the payment. Finally, she had managed to rent out a property that had been sitting idle!

The feeling of having extra income was delightful!

After receiving the keys and saying goodbye to the landlord, Xiaoxing promptly closed the door behind her and asked her system, "System, can you check if there are any surveillance cameras in this apartment?"
