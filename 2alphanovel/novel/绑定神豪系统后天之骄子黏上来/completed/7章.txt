**Skill Reward**

Li Qichen felt a wave of relief wash over him as he observed Stella Ling shop with remarkable efficiency, swiftly gathering her desired items and completing the payment. Just when he thought they could finally leave this embarrassing place behind, Stella was unexpectedly led by a store attendant into the fitting room.

Li Qichen froze in place: ?! 

A sudden sensation of being toyed with by someone he cared about washed over him, leaving him feeling vulnerable. To make matters worse, his mind began to wander into inappropriate territory. He couldn't help but recall the colors and sizes of the two bras Stella had selected earlier, and he found himself imagining what she would look like wearing them.

Stop it, stop it right now!!!

If he allowed his thoughts to spiral further into madness, he would really become a pervert! He shook his head vigorously, trying to dispel the discordant images invading his mind while enduring the occasional curious glances from passersby.

As he waited, increasingly anxious, he inadvertently caught sight of the name of the lingerie store: "Desire." The words pierced his heart, making him feel so embarrassed that he wanted to flee from this place. But for the sake of their upcoming encounter, he stifled the urge to escape. 

Stella emerged from the fitting room as quickly as she had entered, and for a moment, he thought he could finally leave. However, she defied his expectations by strolling over to the lounge area of the store and leisurely sipping on a cup of coffee.

Li Qichen stood outside, feeling like time was dragging on. Why was this woman torturing him so? Just then, a young woman passing by approached him, asking for his WeChat. Caught off guard and still waiting for Stella, he outright rejected her.

Undeterred, the young woman persisted, teasingly inquiring if he was waiting for a girlfriend at the lingerie store entrance. Li Qichen's heart raced, and he felt heat rise to his cheeks. He wanted to respond that he was waiting for his girlfriend, but he and Stella barely knew each other—they weren't even friends.

The young woman, noticing the handsome man's flushed face, was taken aback and thought, Wow, he's so innocent! She couldn't help but feel envious of the mysterious girlfriend who could elicit such a reaction from him. In her mind, this man's girlfriend must be stunning—so beautiful that he would willingly stand outside a lingerie store for her.

Yet, she couldn't shake a sense of competition. What if the other woman wasn't as pretty as she was? If she tried hard enough, maybe she could steal this charming innocent boy away!

Having never encountered a man so perfectly aligned with her tastes, she was determined. Even if they couldn't become an intimate couple, just being friends with a guy this handsome would be worth it!

As the young woman remained at his side despite being rejected, Li Qichen felt a growing irritation. If Stella came out and saw him with another woman, it could lead to misunderstandings about their relationship!

With that thought in mind, Li Qichen stepped away from the entrance of the lingerie store, moving to the other side to continue waiting for Stella. The young woman felt disheartened when the handsome man distanced himself from her; she bit her lip, contemplating whether to give up. But the allure of such a rare find compelled her to follow him.

As the saying goes, "A girl chasing a boy is like passing through a thin veil." As long as a girl was willing to be proactive, even if the boy initially showed disinterest, persistence would eventually yield results!

Li Qichen was caught off guard by the young woman's tenacity. He knew he was good-looking and attracted attention, but he usually remained indifferent to advances. Each time, he would simply reject them outright. After being turned down, his suitors would typically back off, perhaps deterred by his family's influence or his cold demeanor.

This was the first time he had encountered someone who simply refused to take a hint. Of course, at that moment, Li Qichen didn’t entertain thoughts like those often found in romance novels: “Very well, woman, you have piqued my interest!” Instead, he only felt an escalating irritation, unconsciously adopting a cold, detached expression.

Looking at him, even his most capable assistant knew better than to approach when he was in such a forbidding state. 

The young woman, who had previously felt merely a slight blow to her confidence, now felt embarrassed. Used to being adored by the men around her, this was her first time being so bluntly rejected. Her pride wouldn’t allow her to linger, yet her competitive spirit swelled.

With a complex expression, she boldly questioned, “What makes her better than me?”

Li Qichen was taken aback. He mentally rolled his eyes—did he even know her? Did he owe her an explanation? If it came down to comparisons, he firmly believed the woman standing before him couldn’t hold a candle to Stella! 

Stella was the brightest, most dazzling star in the night sky! The woman in front of him was simply an obstacle in his pursuit of love. 

“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be bothered right now,” Li Qichen replied coldly, his tone dripping with impatience.

Again rejected, the young woman stubbornly persisted, raising her hands and pointing her index fingers at each other, tilting her head with a pitiful expression. “I’m not trying to bother you; I just want to get to know you…”

“I’m not interested in getting to know you,” Li Qichen shot back, his handsome features now tinged with visible annoyance.

The young woman, her plan to flirt having backfired, finally lost her composure. “It’s just a pretty face! What’s the big deal?”

Their altercation attracted the attention of a store employee inside. Meanwhile, Li Qichen, aware of the situation, decided to tactically withdraw and head to the third-floor lounge area to wait. That space was a necessity for anyone leaving the mall, and Stella would surely pass by there on her way out. He could just sit there and wait for her to come to him.

Before leaving, Li Qichen seriously addressed the agitated young woman still lingering. “I have someone I like, and I won’t be adding any more female friends on WeChat. Please stop following me!”

At that moment, completely unaware of the drama unfolding outside, Stella had just received her newbie reward from the system. It wasn’t the property she desired in the capital city, but a random skill reward instead.

Upon receiving the skill, Stella discovered she had been granted expertise in the Han language. With this skill, she would become comparable to a language expert in Han linguistics. Not only could she perform high-level simultaneous interpretation, but every new word added to the Han language would automatically be input into her brain.

This automatic knowledge update would continue until Stella passed away, freeing her from the burden of memorizing vocabulary lists every day!

Stella found the sensation quite extraordinary. Becoming a language expert so effortlessly made her feel that her four years of studying Han had been a waste, yet it was also incredibly magical how her proficiency could increase so dramatically in just one day!

With her current level of Han proficiency, she could easily resign and seek a new path as a high-level Han translator, aiming for a better salary. However, ever since she began her internship, her senior, Zhang Aiyue, had helped her immensely. She preferred not to leave the internship period, not wanting to cause any trouble for her company or make things difficult for her senior.

Once her internship was complete and she handed over all her responsibilities, she could consider quitting then. 

Having made the decision to stay, Stella let out a long sigh. Since she didn’t win the property she wanted this time, she would have to rely on her own efforts to buy a house!

It was frustrating—she didn’t even have a proper place to stay in the capital, yet here she was, already thinking about buying a house with her translation skills!

Of course, Stella wasn’t considering buying a property in the capital. Even with her newfound Han translation proficiency, she didn’t believe she could afford a home in such a pricey city. 

Owning a small place in a third-tier city in Huaguo would be more than enough for her! 

Having her own little nest in a city with decent development had always been Stella’s dream. It was also a dream shared by many in today’s society. They worked tirelessly, striving for a place to call home.

For the former Stella, buying a house had seemed a distant dream. Yet now, with the Celestial Fortune System at her side, it felt like it might not be as unattainable as she once thought.

“System, will there be a random task tomorrow?” Stella asked in her mind.

【Not necessarily, since it’s random.】

The system replied ambiguously. 

Stella wasn’t discouraged; even if there wasn’t a random task tomorrow, she could still look forward to the weekly tasks in a week, the upcoming monthly tasks, and even yearly tasks. Completing those tasks would also yield opportunities for system rewards. 

If luck was on her side, winning a property wasn’t out of the question!

With those thoughts swirling in her mind, Stella felt a surge of excitement, eager for tomorrow to arrive so she could start on the tasks released by the system.

【Comrade Xiaoxing, take it one step at a time; tasks are meant to be completed one by one. Being anxious won’t help!】

“You’re right; being anxious won’t do any good.” 

Stella slowly stood up from the sofa, thinking, “Then I’ll just take my time browsing around the mall, scouting out items for my next task. After all, KFC is open 24 hours a day; I can go anytime. Today, I can definitely treat myself to a bucket of fried chicken without rushing.”

【Ah! That’s something you can be anxious about!】 

The system whimpered, eager to sink its metaphorical teeth into some delicious fried chicken!

If it weren’t for the Celestial Fortune System, a financially strapped Stella wouldn’t have been able to afford such expensive lingerie today, nor would she have gained expertise in the Han language. 

She was just teasing the system, of course, and would prioritize satisfying its cravings. 

KFC, here we come!

As Stella left the lingerie store, she brushed past a stunning young woman. At that moment, the woman gave her a curious glance, leaving Stella somewhat puzzled. 

However, the woman quickly glanced at her face a few times before mumbling something and turning back to enter the store.

Stella didn’t catch what the woman said and assumed she must have mistaken her for someone else.

【Host, that woman just insulted you!】

“Really? What did she say?” 

Stella continued walking away, asking the system in her mind.

【She said: Hmph! So ugly, it can’t possibly be her!】

【That’s so mean! You’re clearly very pretty!】 the system exclaimed indignantly.

“Are you serious?” 

The system’s compliments made Stella feel both delighted and slightly amused. She could say she wasn’t ugly, but “very pretty” seemed a stretch.

The system didn’t think much of it; it simply believed that Stella, heading to KFC for a bucket of fried chicken, was the most beautiful fairy in the world! Anyone who insulted her was just a mean-spirited ugly person!

Inevitably, Stella felt a twinge of disdain towards the young woman she had just passed. Insulting someone’s appearance for no reason was truly lacking in basic decency.

Meanwhile, sitting in the third-floor lounge, Li Qichen quickly turned down two more young women who approached him, finally spotting the figure he had been longing to see.

As he saw Stella, shopping bags in hand, about to step onto the escalator, he immediately stood up and strode over to her.

Just two steps away from Stella, Li Qichen suddenly halted, realizing that meeting Stella at the entrance of the lingerie store might not have been the best idea.

Introducing themselves at the escalator didn’t seem like a romantic beginning to a love story at all—he found it utterly unromantic! 

Most importantly, he couldn’t figure out a way to introduce himself to Stella!

He had no choice but to trail closely behind her, keeping a safe distance. 

Li Qichen followed Stella out of Jinghua Guomao, and she led him to a nearby fast-food restaurant. 

As they entered KFC, the joyful sounds of children mingling with adults' conversations filled the air, reaching Stella’s ears. Everyone here seemed genuinely happy, especially the children and students. 

Under the watchful eyes of their parents, they happily devoured their meals, occasionally sipping on soda through straws, completely content. 

For them, this was a moment of joy. 

Although it was Stella’s second time at KFC, she vividly remembered experiencing such happiness. 

When Stella had turned ten, her parents had taken her to Lin City for her birthday, where they enjoyed KFC together. It was her first taste of such delicious food. 

At that time, she had begged her parents to bring her back the following year for her birthday. Naturally, they had happily agreed. 

But sadly, they never got to fulfill that promise. Three months before her eleventh birthday, they left this world forever. 

After that, she had never set foot in a fast-food restaurant again. 

Subconsciously, Stella felt that this place was meant to be shared with her parents. She shouldn’t be going in alone.

【Host, what are you daydreaming about? Don’t you want to eat fried chicken?】 

At that moment, the system reminded her, its digital mouth watering at the thought, pulling Stella back from her memories.

“Don’t worry, I’m going to get in line right now.” 

Collecting her thoughts, Stella smiled back in her mind.

Today, she wasn’t alone in this place. She had her little greedy cat system with her, so it wasn’t lonely at all! 

Inhaling the tantalizing aroma of fried food wafting through the air, Stella stepped to the end of the line to place her order. 

Suddenly, she caught a whiff of a fresh, cool scent that was distinct from the food. 

Turning to locate the source of the scent, she found a strikingly handsome man standing barely half a step behind her. 

Once she saw his full figure, Stella was immediately taken aback by his breathtaking looks, causing her heart to race. 

Not daring to stare too long, she quickly turned her head away. 

Though she had only caught a fleeting glimpse, she couldn’t help but feel that such an extraordinary-looking man, exuding elegance, must not appreciate being stared at. 

Humans are visual creatures; when confronted with a beautiful stranger, the instinct to look more is hard to resist. 

Stella suppressed that desire, not wanting to earn a disdainful glance from the handsome stranger.

However, the man took the initiative to step closer and greet her. 

“Hello, miss.”

“… Hello.” 

The pleasant scent drifted into her lungs, and Stella responded a bit shyly. 

“Do you often come here to place orders?” 

His magnetic voice continued to captivate her ears. Stella blinked a few times, momentarily lost for words, before stammering, “... Not really.” 

“That’s a pity. I’m here for the first time and was hoping you could recommend some items from the menu.” 

“I’m ordering for my little nephew. He only said he wanted KFC but didn’t specify anything else.” 

Li Qichen feigned exasperation as he glanced up at the electronic menu hanging above the counter, continuing, “I can’t just order everything on the menu, can I?” 

Stella realized with relief that the handsome man was simply seeking her help. 

But considering this was only her second time at KFC, and the first had been thirteen years ago, she felt unqualified to recommend anything. 

Looking at the man’s beautifully shaped lips and his seemingly troubled expression as he stared at the menu, she felt a pang of sympathy. 

She glanced over at the kids eating nearby, noting how varied their orders were, offering no real guidance. Finally, she suggested, “Why not ask the staff when you order? They should know what kids like.” 

“You make a good point. Thank you for the suggestion.” 

Li Qichen’s bright and charming eyes lit up with a grateful smile. 

“No need to thank me; I didn’t really help much.” 

As she noticed the smile gracing the handsome man’s lips and the warmth in his gaze, Stella felt a touch of shyness and waved her hand dismissively.
