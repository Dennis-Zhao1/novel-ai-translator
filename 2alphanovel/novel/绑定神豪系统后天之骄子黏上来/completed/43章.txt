**Wealthy Watch Enthusiast**

Stella Ling naturally believed in the promise of the Celestial Fortune System.

“Then they know how much money I have in my account now, right?” Stella asked.

“Li Qichen should know, but the one surnamed Zhong hasn’t probed that deeply; he only checked your transaction records,” Celestial Fortune responded, taking a sip from his hand-pulled Hong Kong milk tea.

After receiving a confirmed answer, Stella furrowed her brows, her lips unconsciously drooping. Her impression of Li Qichen was worsening, nearing the level of disdain she held for Lu Mingxu. She hadn’t expected that the man pretending to be dazed would be surnamed Zhong. Stella was surprised that he had managed to investigate her identity so quickly. However, given his extreme personality and unstable mental state, she wasn't too shocked by his actions. After all, this was a man who would go to great lengths, even risking his life.

For the moment, Stella didn’t want to comment on the man’s behavior. But why was Li Qichen investigating her? Was it simply because he liked her? Could someone be so infatuated that they would check a bank account? 

Stella felt offended, but also thought it was a result of her extraordinary luck. She could only rationalize that these people weren’t acting normally and deserved some leniency. As long as they didn’t touch her money, there was no need to make a fuss.

The next day, Stella went to Huaguo Industrial and Commercial Bank to apply for a new bank card. She transferred all the money from her old account to this new card and upgraded it to a platinum card, becoming a six-star client of the bank. Her account information would receive tighter security measures.

Once Stella’s assets surpassed one hundred million and she started her own company, owning real estate and luxury cars, this platinum card could even be upgraded to a diamond card after a bank evaluation. Stella was confident that with Celestial Fortune by her side, that day would come sooner than later.

Today was Friday. Last week's Dragon Boat Festival marked a crucial phase in the collaboration with Jinghua International Trade. As a result, all employees of Stella's company had worked diligently through the holiday weekend without any break. It was only yesterday that the company compensated them for the missed holiday and advanced their salaries by five days, covering the overtime pay for those days as well.

Stella planned to use these days off to scout for high-potential talents in the entertainment industry around Sanlitun SOHO. She knew she should return to this area in the evening, just like she did yesterday, to search for talent. However, the thought that someone might be lurking near her rented apartment, peering through her windows, made her reluctant to stay there.

Fortunately, whenever she was at her rented place with Celestial Fortune, they always drew the sheer, opaque curtains, ensuring that the unique aspects of her home remained hidden from prying eyes. Celestial Fortune reassured her that even without the curtains, he could use high-tech virtual imagery to conceal the reality inside, so even if someone leaned against the window to look in, they wouldn't notice anything unusual.

With Celestial Fortune's words calming her, Stella began to wander around the Sanlitun SOHO area. The streets were bustling with fashionable young people, but Stella couldn’t tell if they were trainees in the entertainment industry or just youths out for fun. She hesitated to activate her Insightful Eye ability, as it had a daily limit of one hour, and she didn’t want to waste it.

After wandering for a long time without spotting any particularly outstanding young talents, she remembered that since she had decided to recruit Xu Shujun into her girl group, the other members couldn’t be any less attractive than her. They had to be of equal or greater beauty, and she wasn’t looking for anyone with a potential score below nine; it had to be higher.

**Ding! Today’s daily task: Spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!**

**Ding! Random task triggered: Spend 5 million yuan within 2 hours!**

“Stella, I’m so annoyed! There are too many people, and I don’t want to keep looking for handsome guys near you! Let’s hide in a store and rest for a bit!” Celestial Fortune whined.

Stella replied, “…”

It was obvious Celestial Fortune was trying to slack off again. But with so many tasks requiring spending, the nearest shopping center was Taikoo Li. Wouldn’t that place be even more crowded?

Reluctantly, Stella walked west toward Taikoo Li amidst Celestial Fortune's complaints. Once inside this open shopping area, she noticed many luxury brand stores.

Since the random tasks Celestial Fortune had been issuing were getting increasingly expensive, Stella had done some online research on luxury brands for future reference. Today, she was just scouting for talent and didn’t plan to buy heavy items that would be inconvenient to carry.

After considering various luxury stores, she finally entered a brand watch store named Vacheron Constantin. To be honest, Stella felt she didn’t really need a watch; she could check the time on her phone. But she had heard the saying: the poor play with cars, and the rich play with watches. As someone about to become a boss of an entertainment company, she felt she should buy a watch to serve as a status symbol.

Once inside, Stella approached the nearest salesperson and said, “Please show me women’s watches around a million yuan.”

Since she was buying a watch, it had to be something worthy of collecting. The salesperson quickly presented two stunning women’s watches for her to choose from.

The first was the ÉGÉRIE Moonphase 8016F/127G-B499 from the Goddess series, made of 18K white gold adorned with diamonds that sparkled brilliantly. The moon phase display was positioned between one and two o'clock, showing two mother-of-pearl moons behind a sapphire crystal cloud, radiating enchanting charm. The price was 1.25 million yuan.

The second was from the Tradition series, the Tourbillon Jewelry 6025T/000G-B635. This watch featured an 18K white gold case with two blue straps made of satin and leather. The design was inspired by the Maltese cross, showcasing a complex movement with an edge-type rotor, highlighting the beauty of the movement. The body was studded with 559 brilliant-cut diamonds and step-cut diamonds, presenting extraordinary artistry. The price was 1.61 million yuan.

Stella thought both watches were beautiful and decided to buy them both. After completing the payment, she received a notification that her daily task was complete. She immediately put on the adjusted ÉGÉRIE Moonphase watch and carried the shopping bag containing the other watch as she left Vacheron Constantin.

With 2.15 million yuan remaining from the random task budget, Stella pondered for a moment before turning back into a jewelry store, BVLGARI. Inside, apart from her, there were four stunning young women in their twenties picking out accessories.

To be precise, only one girl was selecting jewelry, while the other three were simply accompanying her. 

“Lili, Mr. Wang is too good to you; he gives you pocket money every month for jewelry!” One of the girls with bleached hair said enviously, looking at the girl shopping.

“Of course! Mr. Wang really likes me now, so he spoils me,” Li Li said proudly. She loved hearing others speak to her with envy.

She tried on an 18K white gold snake-shaped bracelet, twisting her wrist back and forth to see how it looked, and said with a coy tone, “You guys should come with me to the cocktail party tonight. I guarantee each of you can find a boyfriend who treats you like Mr. Wang treats me.”

Hearing this, the girl with the bleached hair hesitated for a moment, but she and another girl with a bun nodded in agreement, thanking Li Li for the opportunity.

“What about you, Song Mengmeng? Why aren’t you saying anything?” Li Li asked, turning to the girl with half-black, half-pink hair.

Song Mengmeng blinked her big eyes, adorned with smoky eye makeup, and quietly replied, “I want to think it over some more.”

“What is there to think about? Do you want to spend your life in a bar, or do you want to be a trainee at that small company forever?” Li Li scoffed at Song Mengmeng.

Trainee!

Catching the sensitive term, Stella paused as she approached the jewelry display case and turned to closely observe the four girls. Aside from the half-pink-haired girl, who was heavily made up, the other three girls looked quite appealing. However, recalling their earlier conversation, Stella instantly lost interest.

She didn’t want anyone with a troubled past in her girl group. Bars, cocktail parties, trainees—so these four were just looking to ingratiate themselves with some big shots tonight.

“Just give me a little more time to think about it,” Song Mengmeng murmured.

“Humph.” Li Li snorted lightly, turning back to continue picking out accessories, saying, “You’d better give me an answer before I finish choosing; I’m only giving you this one chance.”

Song Mengmeng's eyes flashed with struggle as she hesitated for a moment before whispering, “I’ll think about it some more.”

Li Li instantly lost interest in selecting jewelry upon hearing Song Mengmeng's response. 

She was so captivating when singing, yet outside of the mic, she couldn’t muster a coherent thought. 

Thinking about how Mr. Wang had frequently inquired about Song Mengmeng’s absence from the cocktail party, Li Li felt even more annoyed. 

What was the point of picking anything? Mr. Wang had just given her 30,000 yuan; what could she possibly buy here!

Just as Li Li was about to notify Song Mengmeng that her time to decide was up, she suddenly heard a soft female voice say, “Please show me a piece of jewelry priced around 2.15 million yuan.”

Stella scanned the jewelry around her and noticed that snake-shaped accessories were quite common, so she added, “I don’t want snake-shaped jewelry.”

The jewelry salesperson smiled and replied, “Certainly, please wait a moment.”

Before leaving, the salesperson noticed Stella’s watch and the shopping bag she was carrying and suggested, “Ma’am, we have a 2.2 million yuan emerald jewelry watch. Would you like to take a look?”

“Sure,” Stella nodded. It wouldn’t hurt to buy another watch; she could wear it interchangeably.

Li Li thought to herself, “What a rich girl!”

Shortly after, the jewelry salesperson brought over the 2.2 million yuan emerald jewelry watch.

“Ma’am, the GPHG is the Oscar of the watch industry, and this BVLGARI DIVA emerald luxury watch won the ‘Best Jewelry Watch’ award at the 14th GPHG. The design is inspired by classical aesthetic forms, reflecting the mosaic patterns of ancient Roman tile art, rooted in 2,700 years of Roman history and tradition.”

As the salesperson helped Stella put the emerald watch on her right wrist, she continued, “This watch’s case and bracelet are made of 18K white gold, set with 42 step-cut diamonds, 8 round-cut diamonds, and approximately 10.29 carats of brilliant-cut diamonds, along with 250 step-cut emeralds and 8 round-cut emeralds totaling about 10.52 carats.”

The outer dial was surrounded by a series of fan-shaped patterns, each of which was movable, resembling a gracefully dancing queen.

Stella absolutely adored this exquisite jeweled watch and asked the salesperson, “Can I buy it for 2.15 million yuan?”

“Absolutely, I’ll wrap it up for you now,” the salesperson nodded.

“No need; I’ll just wear it out,” Stella replied, taking off the moonphase watch from her left wrist and putting on the emerald jewelry watch instead.

The silver and green hues sparkled with starlight, and Stella slowly turned her wrist, finding herself falling more in love with the watch by the second.

It wasn’t just Stella who loved the watch; everyone who saw it was captivated by its luxurious and elegant appearance.

Li Li felt a pang of jealousy. She couldn’t even afford a 50,000 yuan white gold bracelet yet had to watch a girl who looked better than her flaunt a 200,000 yuan jewelry watch.

The disparity between people was just too vast!

“That watch is stunning!” the girl with the bun exclaimed.

“What does that matter? As long as you come with me to tonight’s cocktail party and find a caring boyfriend like Mr. Wang, you could wear a watch like that without spending your own money!” Li Li said, enviously and jealously throwing out her skewed perspective, causing the jewelry salesperson assisting Stella to roll her eyes at her.

How shameless!

Did this woman not realize her loud voice made it clear to everyone in the store about her experiences of accompanying older men in bars?

The salesperson inwardly lamented the decline of societal values.

Stella glanced back at the four girls, looking particularly at the one who had just made that shameless remark, now standing awkwardly behind the other three girls.

For some reason, Stella recalled what Hu Dongdong had once told her: “In their lives, no one talks to them about knowledge or insights; they only discuss resources and connections. Very few genuinely focus on learning what a trainee should learn.”

“Each person came to this city with dreams, wanting to strive for something.”

“And now, when I talk to them about ideals, they think I'm a fool.”

Stella didn’t want to be the fool, so she decided against lecturing them.
