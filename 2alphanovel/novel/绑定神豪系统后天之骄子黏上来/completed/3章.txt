**Increased Amount**

The next morning.

Stella Ling woke up from her dreams, squinting at her phone only to realize she still had five minutes before her alarm would ring. Feeling a bit annoyed, she turned off the alarm and sat up in bed.

Ever since her internship started, Stella found herself waking up a few minutes early almost every day. Setting an alarm seemed unnecessary at this point.

Rubbing her eyes, she glanced down at her little cat, curled up like a fluffy ball beside her pillow, deeply asleep. After thinking it over, she decided not to wake it, and quietly slid out of bed, making her way to the bathroom in her dorm.

After freshening up, Stella slipped out of her pajamas and pulled a clean outfit from her storage locker. The new bra she put on felt a bit tight; the one that fit her perfectly was currently being washed and hung out to dry on the balcony of her dorm. With only two bras to her name, she had no choice but to endure the discomfort for now, as she was determined not to spend money unless absolutely necessary. For someone like her, an orphan, saving money was crucial, and she only spent when absolutely needed.

Inhaling the fresh scent of laundry detergent wafting from her clothes, Stella brushed her shoulder-length hair back in front of the mirror, tying it into a low ponytail with a black hair tie. 

Hmm, today she looked pretty much the same—still quite ordinary. However, having grown accustomed to her appearance, there were times when she felt that the girl in the mirror looked a bit better than usual, even if it was just her imagination.

She began applying makeup using the cosmetics laid out on her desk. Stella was interning at a cosmetics company, a well-known brand in her country called "Snow White," which had established a subsidiary in Jing City, Huaguo, where she worked in the marketing department as a translator.

She remembered her first day of the internship when she applied lip balm before heading to work. That day, her supervisor and senior sister brought her a small box filled with the company’s cosmetics and insisted she learn to apply makeup properly.

Thus, the cosmetics she was currently using, along with a few samples, were all gifts from the company, saving her a chunk of change in that department.

As she was going through her makeup routine, her eyes paused on the eyeliner pencil sitting on the desk. After a couple of seconds of contemplation, she decided against using it today. Her hands often fumbled with makeup, and if she made a mistake, she'd have to remove it and start over, wasting precious time.

Coughing lightly, she decided to skip that step altogether.

Stella's four years in university had been rather mundane; aside from attending classes, eating, and sleeping, she spent most of her time studying or tutoring to earn her living expenses. She was broke and busy, unlike other students who could afford to buy cosmetics early on and experiment with makeup.

It wasn't until her internship that she began to dabble in makeup, and her skills were still quite lacking. Since she was interning at a Huanguo company, most of the higher-ups were from Huanguo, where appearances were highly regarded. In their eyes, not wearing makeup was almost as inappropriate as being undressed.

Therefore, despite her lack of skills, Stella had to muster the courage to slather on some makeup. Looking at her face in the mirror, which appeared a shade lighter after the application, she finally applied a coral lip balm. She preferred softer shades over bold colors, not only because she disliked the latter but also because her looks and makeup skills couldn't handle such vibrant hues.

Once she had finished her makeup, Stella grabbed her bag and woke up her little tricolor cat, who was still lost in its dreams.

"Meow~ Is it morning already?"

The system stretched with its back arched and paws on the ground, yawning widely. 

Stella, still half-asleep, wondered if the system really needed to sleep like a regular cat. Was it truly a system or just a cat?

"Time for a new day! Lucky goose, come collect your daily mission: spend 1 yuan within ten minutes!"

Once the system shook off its drowsiness, it raised its paw high and issued today’s task. The amount wasn’t particularly exciting, but it was a significant increase compared to yesterday—ten times more, in fact.

This time, the system directly transferred the task funds into Stella's hands. With little time to waste, she quickly grabbed a 1-yuan bill and rushed out of her dorm, heading straight for the supermarket she visited yesterday.

The small supermarket in front of the dorm not only sold snacks and daily necessities but also had a breakfast stall. Stella planned to use the task funds to cover her breakfast today.

Since she woke up relatively early, only a few students were in the supermarket, and the two tables in front of the breakfast stall were empty. 

Stella approached the stall and, as usual, ordered two vegetarian buns, a boiled egg, and a bowl of black rice porridge before finding a seat.

Each vegetarian bun cost 0.5 yuan, the boiled egg was 1 yuan, and the black rice porridge also cost 1 yuan, totaling 3 yuan for breakfast. However, thanks to the task funds, her actual expenditure was only 2 yuan. 

Happy to save 1 yuan, Stella took a bite of her bun when she noticed some movement in her bag. 

Looking down, she was startled to see a cat's head popping out, its big, round eyes fixated on her breakfast.

Suddenly facing that drooling cat face made the delicious bun in her mouth feel a bit less appetizing. 

After a moment of hesitation, Stella peeled the shell off her untouched boiled egg. She glanced around and, seeing no one paying attention, she discreetly handed the egg to the system hiding in her bag, communicating with it in her mind. 

"Remember not to get the egg crumbs all over my bag, or it’ll stink!"

【Don’t worry, I won’t get any crumbs in your bag!】 

The system nodded enthusiastically. 

After handing over the egg, Stella was stunned by what she saw next. The system actually stuffed the entire boiled egg into its mouth, leaving her in shock as she instinctively reached out to pull it back out.

What the heck! She just wanted it to be careful, not to swallow the whole thing!

That egg was almost as big as its little cat head—was it not afraid of choking?

Just as Stella was panicking over the system's egg-swallowing antics, the next moment, she saw the egg smoothly sliding down the system's throat. 

She even caught a glimpse of the bulge as it passed through the system’s throat.

【Don’t worry, I’m a system. How could I choke on something so trivial?】 

The system patted its belly with satisfaction.

Stella shook herself out of her shock. 

Right, she had almost forgotten—it may look like a small cat, but it was essentially a high-tech system from another dimension. There was no way it could choke on a mere boiled egg.

“Almost forgot you’re a system, not a real cat.”

Then, shifting her tone, she narrowed her eyes and asked in her mind, “Didn’t you say that systems don’t need to eat?”

【Um, well, I can eat a little. The food I consume can be converted into energy, helping me to issue tasks in better spirits...】 

The system replied slowly, its tone revealing a hint of guilt.

Hmph, so you thought you could scare me!

Watching the system curl up and hide back in her bag, Stella resumed enjoying her bun.

After finishing her breakfast, Stella stepped out of the school gates and headed to the nearby subway station. 

By 8 AM, she arrived at the company. 

In her office, aside from the logistics and administrative departments, everyone else worked a 9 to 5 schedule. Currently, Stella was the only employee in the marketing department. 

The reason she arrived an hour early was to study Huanyu vocabulary. 

Since being hired, Stella had discovered that even though she had memorized the entire Huanyu dictionary during her university days, there were still some Huanyu terms she didn’t recognize—especially those related to cosmetic ingredients.

Moreover, every year, Huanyu introduced many new foreign terms, so Stella continued her early morning vocabulary review that she had started back in her freshman year.

Her diligent study habits not only earned the admiration of her department supervisor but also made her translation work much easier.

However, there were those in the company who found Stella’s behavior pretentious, thinking she was just putting on an act. 

One such person was a fellow intern, who happened to be from the same school, major, and even shared the same dormitory as Stella.

Just as she thought of this, a young woman dressed in a Barbie pink dress sat down at the workstation to Stella's right. 

The newcomer first placed her matching pink handbag on the desk, then swept her chestnut-colored long curls behind her ear. 

Next, she pulled out a makeup mirror from her bag and spent about five minutes checking her makeup before lazily putting the mirror away and turning on her computer.

“Wow, you’re here early again today.” 

Wang Lingling seemed to just notice Stella’s presence and greeted her casually.

Stella nodded slightly in acknowledgment.
