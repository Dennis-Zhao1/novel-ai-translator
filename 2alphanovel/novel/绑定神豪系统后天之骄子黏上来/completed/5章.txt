It wasn't until the department supervisor arrived that Wang Lingling reluctantly returned to her workstation. From that moment on, her focus was clearly elsewhere, and the documents she translated contained several glaring errors. The supervisor, infuriated, called Wang Lingling into her office and reprimanded her until she was in tears, finally letting her go only after a thorough scolding.

During the lunch break, the supervisor asked Stella Ling to bring her lunch to the office. Upon entering, Stella noticed that the supervisor, Zhang Aiyue, gestured for her to pull up a chair and sit across from her desk. Stella felt a bit uneasy, knowing that this senior, two years her elder, had something she wanted to discuss, which was why she had invited Stella to share lunch.

Zhang Aiyue noticed that Stella's meal was a cheap box lunch consisting of one meat and two vegetable dishes, with the meat being nothing more than fried starch and a hot dog. Without hesitation, she picked up a chicken leg from her fried chicken combo and handed it over to Stella.

Stella wanted to refuse the offer, but Zhang Aiyue's insistence was firm, and she had no choice but to accept the chicken leg. Satisfied, Zhang Aiyue began to eat while casually asking, “Stella, why did you switch workstations with Lingling?”

“It was her sudden decision,” Stella replied after swallowing a mouthful of vegetables.

“Why? Was there a reason?” Zhang Aiyue pressed further.

“I don't know,” Stella shook her head.

Stella speculated that Wang Lingling's reason for wanting to change desks was due to the guy in the shirt across the office building. But that was purely a guess; what if it wasn't true? Remembering Wang Lingling's bizarre behavior earlier by the floor-to-ceiling window, Stella felt a lingering shock. She never liked gossiping behind people's backs, so she decided not to share her thoughts with her senior.

Fortunately, Zhang Aiyue only asked a couple of questions and then dropped the topic about Wang Lingling, which relieved Stella as she focused back on her meal.

As she picked up the chicken leg that her senior had given her, just as it was about to reach her mouth, she heard the sound of the greedy Cat System salivating in her mind.

【Is it tasty?】

Stella couldn't help but roll her eyes in her thoughts: “I haven't even eaten it yet!”

“I can't give you the chicken leg. If I leave it in the box lunch, the supervisor will think I have issues with her.”

【Alright… then I’ll just watch you eat.】

Suddenly, the chicken leg in front of Stella seemed less appetizing. In reality, it was just her imagination. The moment she took a bite of the fried chicken leg, a burst of salty, juicy flavor filled her mouth.

It was far from hard to swallow; in fact, she wanted to have another one after finishing the first. Outside of company gatherings, Stella rarely got to enjoy meat. It wasn’t that she couldn’t afford it, but rather she was trying to cut down on food expenses to save more money. Usually, she’d order the cheapest vegetarian box lunch. Occasionally, she would splurge on a meat-and-vegetable combo to satisfy her craving for meat. Today was one of those days.

Unfortunately, luck wasn’t on her side, as the meat in her box lunch turned out to be a starch hot dog. Although she found the starch sausage delicious, real meat was still more appealing. Fried chicken legs were unbeatable!

After the lunch break ended, Stella returned to her work. Perhaps it was because her senior had scolded her so harshly, but in the afternoon, Wang Lingling shifted her focus away from the floor-to-ceiling window and concentrated on her tasks. While there were still errors in her translations, they weren’t as outrageous as in the morning.

Finally, it was time to clock out. Stella quickly tidied her desk and grabbed her bag. She wanted to rush back to the dormitory, take off her ill-fitting bra, and relax.

Suddenly, a message from the system echoed in her mind: 【Random task triggered, spend 1000 yuan within 20 minutes!】 

【The task funds have been deposited into the host's bank account by the lovely system. Hurry and complete the task!】

The system prompt rang in her head like a clap of thunder, causing Stella to stop in her tracks. 

“Ding!”

At the same time, her phone buzzed with a notification. Pulling out her phone, she saw that 1000 yuan had just been transferred into her bank account.

“Huaguo Construction Bank notification: Your account ending in 3939 received 1000 yuan on May 26 at 17:01, balance 10578.00 yuan.”

Stella's heart raced as she walked out of the office, internally asking the system, “Is the money that just hit my account the funds for this task?”

【That’s right.】

“Is the amount for random tasks always this much?”

【Is that a lot? The minimum amount for a random task is always 1000 yuan, with no upper limit!】

Stella’s fingers tightened around her bag strap as she felt a slight tremor in her hand. She kept moving, joining the crowd of people heading to the elevator. 

Inside the elevator, it was packed, with people crammed together like sardines in a can. The excitement of the random task made Stella's heart race. Her breathing quickened, and combined with the cramped space of the elevator, she felt her bra constricting even more.

Trying to ignore the discomfort, Stella continued to ask the system in her mind, “Is there any problem with the account that deposited the money? Am I going to get investigated?”

【Of course not!】 

【All task funds issued by this system are safe and legal in the host's world.】

【Plus, I am a system from the gods, from the 888 Nebula. With the current technological level on Blue Star, it’s impossible for anyone to trace it back!】

Stella felt her worries dissipate. Finally, the elevator reached the ground floor, and she flowed with the crowd out of the office building, heading straight for the nearest shopping center across the street.

That shopping center was located right next to the building where the shirt guy was. Stella quickly crossed the road and entered the largest shopping center in Jing City—Jinghua Guomao Mall.

Pulling out her phone, Stella checked the reviews to find an underwear store on the third floor of the mall. With only 10 minutes left before the task deadline, she headed directly to the nearest store named “Lianmu.” 

As soon as she stepped inside, a young and beautiful sales assistant approached her. 

“Hello, ma’am! How can I assist you today?”

“I’d like to get this one and this one in a B cup, please.” Stella raised her phone to show the assistant the items.

The two items were priced at 500 yuan each, totaling exactly 1000 yuan.

“Sure, ma’am! Please have a seat over here while I get those items for you.” The assistant led Stella to the designated waiting area for customers.

After about two minutes, the assistant returned with the two items Stella requested.

“Ma’am, I have the items you wanted. The fitting rooms are over there; please follow me.”

“Can I pay first and then try them on?” Stella was eager to spend the task funds.

The assistant paused for a moment, then smiled and replied, “Of course.”

She added that if the bras didn’t fit, Stella could exchange them as long as the tags weren’t cut.

With just 5 minutes left on the clock, Stella paid with her card, completing the random task.

【Congratulations, host! You have completed the random task and earned a system lottery draw!】

【Would you like to draw now?】

After finishing her payment, Stella was overjoyed but decided to hold off on the lottery draw for now. The assistant led her to the fitting room.

The two bras Stella bought were one in a rocky blue with a flowing pattern and another in a lavender lace design. Both were quite comfortable and fit perfectly, making Stella reluctant to take them off.

However, she had a bit of a cleanliness obsession; even though she tried them on, she insisted on washing new bras before wearing them.

After putting on the tight-fitting bra again, Stella didn’t rush back to the dorm. She told the assistant she felt a bit tired and wanted to sit for a while in the rest area.

The assistant gladly obliged and even brought Stella a cup of complimentary coffee to enjoy.

Sipping the coffee contentedly, Stella looked around at the dreamy, fairy-tale-themed decor of the lingerie store. 

Jinghua Guomao truly lived up to its reputation as a high-end commercial hub; even the lingerie stores were so upscale. 

The staff were also incredibly friendly. Regardless of the fact that Stella was purchasing from the store's lower price range, the assistant didn’t show her any disdain.

Nothing like the condescending behavior she had seen in those melodramatic dramas she watched while studying Han language.

Looking out through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the rest area, the sunset cast a golden glow over the bustling streets, creating a breathtaking view that put her at ease.

After finishing her coffee, Stella notified the system that she was ready to draw her lottery.

The next moment, a spinning golden wheel appeared before her eyes.
