Chapter 1: The Insightful Gaze

Stella Ling, a 24-year-old woman, was sitting in her modest office at Starry Entertainment, a newly established talent agency she had founded. The walls were adorned with posters of popular artists, but the space still felt a bit empty—much like her heart, which longed to see her dreams come to fruition. Today, she was reviewing a batch of resumes, looking for fresh talent to add to her budding roster.

One resume caught her eye: Feng Xiaocong. The details were impressive. She was 22 years old, stood at 167 centimeters, and had graduated from the People's Sports Academy. What truly piqued Stella's interest was the title of "National Wu Ying-level Athlete" and the fact that Xiaocong had won the national martial arts championship in 2019. Starting martial arts at the tender age of five, she was proficient in various styles, including Bajiquan and Baguazhang, and skilled with weapons like the sword and spear.

Stella's smile froze on her face as she absorbed the weight of the accomplishments listed in front of her. National champion? Wu Ying-level athlete? She quickly grabbed her phone and began to search for the significance of these titles. After reading through the information, she felt an overwhelming desire to shout, “Wow!”

“9.7 for martial arts performance? Feng Xiaocong must be a real powerhouse!” Stella thought to herself, realizing that this resume was not something she would have overlooked. Had she seen these credentials earlier, she would have immediately called Xiaocong to invite her for an interview, offering to cover her travel expenses without a second thought.

Even though Stella wasn't particularly invested in the entertainment industry, she had heard of the film "Dragon Rising, Tiger Roaring," directed by the renowned Liang Jiahe. She hadn’t watched it, but she remembered reading about its international film awards. To think that Feng Xiaocong had been the stunt double for the lead actress, Zhang Yunying, made her feel a mix of admiration and insecurity.

Starry Entertainment was still in its infancy, lacking a representative project to showcase its strength. How could she manage to secure such a talented individual? The earlier statement from Xiaocong about not wanting to be a stunt double suddenly clicked for Stella. Xiaocong clearly wanted to step away from the shadows and into the spotlight.

Stella scrutinized Xiaocong's face, noticing her striking yet approachable features. While she may not fit the traditional mold of a stunning actress, there was something captivating about her. But looks alone wouldn’t cut it; she needed to appeal to the audience as well. It was clear that Xiaocong had aspirations of making a name for herself on the big screen.

"Maybe some cosmetic enhancements could help?" Stella mused, albeit with a hint of concern. Would a martial arts champion even consider undergoing such procedures? Would it affect her performance?

Lost in her thoughts, Stella stared at Xiaocong, who began to feel increasingly uneasy under her gaze. "Is she judging my looks?" Xiaocong wondered, feeling a wave of self-doubt wash over her.

Breaking the silence, Stella spoke up, "Ms. Feng, if you’re willing to join Starry Entertainment, I can outline two potential career paths for you."

"First, we could go straight for the big screen. I would cast you as the lead in a movie, handpicking the best scripts and hiring a top-notch production team to package you as a female action star."

"Second, you could join our company’s girl group, performing alongside other members. After building a solid fan base both domestically and internationally, you could transition to the big screen as an action star."

"Please, just call me Xiaocong!" she quickly interjected, her brow furrowing in disbelief as she pointed at her face. "But... am I really suited for a girl group?"

"Of course! It’s absolutely doable!" Stella replied enthusiastically, though she couldn't shake the feeling that having Xiaocong in a girl group would be a bit of a waste. After all, she was a national-level athlete!

Xiaocong, feeling suddenly decisive, declared, "Then I choose option two!" Stella was surprised by her decisiveness and quickly led her to the office to sign the contract.

Later that evening, Stella treated the hard-working artists and staff to dinner, formally introducing Xiaocong to everyone. The atmosphere buzzed with excitement when Xu Shujun and Park Haneun learned about Xiaocong's credentials as a national-level athlete.

"Wow, our girl group is going to be incredible! We even have a martial arts expert!" they exclaimed, clearly impressed.

Sitting beside Xiaocong, Song Mengmeng’s eyes lit up like bright bulbs. She loved all things cool and was instantly drawn to the new arrival. However, unbeknownst to her, while Xiaocong appeared fierce during training, she was just like any other girl, with a soft spot for cute and pretty things.

Xiaocong adored the color pink and admired Song Mengmeng's half-dyed pink hair. But she knew such a sweet color didn’t fit her martial arts persona. It suited someone like Mengmeng much better.

That night, as Xiaocong lay in bed, she reflected on her journey into the entertainment industry. With exceptional talent in martial arts, she had won the national championship at 19 and earned the title of Wu Ying-level athlete. It was a year of glory for her, as she was invited by director Liang Jiahe to join the crew of "Dragon Rising, Tiger Roaring" as a stunt double.

The film was a massive success, leading to another offer for a role in "The Stormy Road of Jianghu." Though she once again played a stunt double for the lead actress, the film's reception was lukewarm, primarily due to a weak script. Even with an award-winning actor like Tang Qian in the lead, the film flopped, impacting his career as well.

Xiaocong brushed off the failure of the second film, confident that her stunts had been executed flawlessly. But the subsequent offers that flooded in began to grate on her. All of them were for stunt roles, with not a single opportunity to appear on-screen herself, not even as a supporting character.

She felt a sense of pride typical of martial artists and couldn't help but think, "Why can't I get a role? I can fight well and I don't look that bad!" Frustrated, she turned down those offers and auditioned for roles with fight scenes, only to be met with the same outcome: "We want you as a stunt double."

It felt as though being a stunt double had become an inescapable curse for her. As resentment built up inside her, she channeled those feelings into her training. Her martial arts instructor noticed her distress, prompting him to ask what was troubling her. After she shared her experiences, he offered a sobering perspective.

"These days, it's not about being an action star anymore; the industry has changed," he explained. "With advancements in technology, special effects can handle what used to require physical stunts. The need for action stars has diminished, and opportunities are limited."

As she looked around the industry, Xiaocong saw how the star-making machine had evolved, with various types of celebrities competing fiercely for attention. The action star niche was being squeezed tighter, and it became clear to her that unless she built a fanbase, she would remain a stunt double as long as she stayed in this role.

Her looks didn't help either. Even for minor roles, production teams preferred hiring experienced actors with better looks, relegating her to the background yet again. Over time, Xiaocong's self-esteem took a hit, and she often felt inadequate.

But today, everything changed. She had successfully signed with Starry Entertainment, where the benefits were enticing. Most importantly, Stella had complimented her looks! The thought brought a smile to her face.

"Joining a girl group..." Xiaocong's heart fluttered with excitement as she wondered what her instructor would think when he saw her performing on stage. Would he scold her for not pursuing a serious path? A hint of worry crept in, but the assurance that Stella had given her—building her fanbase first and then transitioning to a female action star—put her mind at ease.

On July 6th, 77 candidates showed up for auditions, but none met the standard. Stella's spirits plummeted. The girl group had four members, but it still felt insufficient. Despite having dancers, vocalists, and even a martial arts performer, she felt something was missing.

Stella's mind drifted to traditional arts—she envisioned integrating elements of opera and folk dance into their performances. The night before, she had stayed up late, researching various traditional performances that combined these genres, which inspired her to recruit members skilled in these arts.

With only two days left to find the right talent, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She planned to visit schools that specialized in opera and folk dance to scout potential members. 

First on her list was the esteemed Sichuan Dance Academy. Founded in 1961, it was a renowned institution in the western region of China, known for its exceptional facilities and comprehensive training programs.

However, since Stella was an outsider, she couldn't just walk in and start recruiting. Instead, she waited outside the school gate, biding her time until the students' lunch break. As she sat in the car, she glanced at her wristwatch—a Vacheron Constantin moon phase model. In just ten minutes, her Insightful Gaze ability would expire, and it was still only 10:30 AM; the lunch break was not yet upon her.

“Insightful Gaze has such a short activation time,” Stella mused to herself.

“Let me guess, you're frustrated?” her system, Zhao Cai, responded with a hint of exasperation. 

Stella chuckled softly, “I can’t help it! I’m just trying to make this work!”

With a quick decision, she transferred the 100,000 yuan from her daily task into a Walmart shopping card. “Let’s head back to the office and swing by Harry Winston first.”

Half an hour later, her Rolls Royce Cullinan Black Badge parked near Harry Winston. Stepping into the luxurious jewelry store, she was greeted warmly by the staff. The dazzling displays of diamond pieces captivated her attention.

“Diamonds may depreciate, but Harry Winston never does,” she recalled reading. This was the confidence behind the brand known as the "King of Diamonds," boasting ownership of a third of the world's most famous diamonds.

Stella wasted no time and headed straight to the most extravagant display. Under the astonished gaze of the sales associates, she selected two high-end jewelry sets. The first was a sapphire and diamond necklace and earring set, priced at 9.2 million yuan, featuring 18 natural sapphires totaling 84.74 carats, complemented by 18 round-cut diamonds.

The second set was even more expensive, coming in at 16,878,000 yuan. This extravagant collection included a necklace, ring, bracelet, and earrings featuring 169.34 carats of Colombian emeralds and diamonds. 

After completing her purchase, Stella became a VIP member of Harry Winston. Once back in her car, she pretended to drop off the jewelry at her residence, but in reality, she stored them in her space ring.

Reflecting on her shopping spree, she noted the upward trajectory of her purchases—starting from 100,000 yuan, then to one million, and now hitting the ten million mark. Next time, she might even consider bidding at an auction for collector-level pieces!

With 3,922,000 yuan left from her task funds, she deposited it into the company’s main account before deciding to spin the prize wheel. 

The pointer whirled around, eventually landing on the rewards area—Insightful Gaze Monthly Card. Claiming this reward would grant her 24-hour access for an entire month to the entertainment industry exclusive version and the luck detection version of the Insightful Gaze ability.

As she received the reward, the card transformed into two invisible white orbs that darted into her eyes, empowering her with a newfound perception.

Little did Stella know, this was just the beginning of her journey into the vibrant, competitive world of entertainment, where dreams and challenges intertwined in ways she’d never anticipated.
