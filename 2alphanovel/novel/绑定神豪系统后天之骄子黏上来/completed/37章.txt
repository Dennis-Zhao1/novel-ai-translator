### The Big Brand Makeover

Even though it was the scorching summer, the lake water in the early morning was still icy cold.

Stella Ling shuddered as she plunged into the water. With all her strength, she pulled Zhong Shensheng up to the shore, only to find him lying there with his eyes tightly shut, appearing to be in a deep coma.

Despair washed over Stella.

She didn’t know how to perform CPR!

Gasping for air and coughing, Stella felt an urgent need to ask her Celestial Fortune System, “What should I do?”

She had managed to get the man out of the water as quickly as she could, yet he was still unconscious from choking on the water.

“Maybe I should call for an ambulance!” 

Just as this thought crossed her mind, the system blared in her head, **[Stella, I just checked his physical condition; he’s fine! This man is quite the trickster! He’s pretending to be unconscious!]**

Stella shot a glance at Zhong Shensheng, still sprawled on the ground. His face was pale, his lips devoid of color, and his chest barely rose and fell; it was clear he seemed to be in a comatose state.

But Stella chose to trust her system.

“Why would he do this?” she wondered aloud, “Is he trying to scam me? He must be a resident of this villa area, right? Does he really need money?”

**[I don’t know.]**

The system replied confidently, leaving Stella speechless.

After a moment of silence, an idea struck Stella. “System, does this guy meet the standards of the Heaven’s Chosen Ones?”

**[No way! He’s disabled!]**

**[Let me check… Wow! He actually qualifies!]**

Stella, upon receiving the system's response, scrambled backward, distancing herself from the man on the ground. 

After calming herself down, she shot a fierce glare at the still-pretending Zhong Shensheng. 

What had she been thinking? Just the other day, she was lamenting how there were too many Heaven's Chosen Ones in the capital, praying she wouldn’t run into any extreme characters.

And then, just like that, she encountered one!

What a coincidence!

He was joking with her life right off the bat!

What was his deal?

Stella seriously doubted whether she was truly a person of good fortune. Why was she so unlucky? If she had known she would run into such a lunatic, she wouldn’t have come to fetch the system at all. After all, the system would eventually find its way back.

Even though the man pretending to be unconscious was a disabled person who couldn’t walk normally, Stella felt no sympathy at that moment. Instead, she found him frightening, her fear of him now rivaling that of Lu Mingxu, who had beaten people half to death.

After taking a moment to rest, she felt strong enough to walk again, so she cradled her little kitten and prepared to leave.

Just as she took a couple of steps, she abruptly halted.

After a moment of thought, she decided to venture back into the lake, retrieve the wheelchair soaked in lake water, and push it next to the man, saying, “I know you’re faking it. If you jump into the lake again, I won’t save you a second time.”

“Life is only once; no matter what the reason, you shouldn’t joke with it.”

With that, Stella picked up her kitten and left.

Zhong Shensheng opened his eyes and turned his head to watch her gradually disappear into the wax plum forest, his expression dark.

Did she see through his act of feigning unconsciousness? Did she think he jumped into the lake because he wanted to end his life, or did she guess he did it to catch her attention?

In truth, it was a mix of both.

He was a disabled man.

Since he couldn’t chase the person he liked with his legs, he had to resort to extreme measures to get her to notice him.

If she showed no interest in him at all, then what did it matter? His life was already meaningless; dying would be better.

“Shouldn't joke with life…” Zhong Shensheng mumbled.

He was surprised himself; a love he had never felt before was ignited by a woman’s abrupt entrance into his life.

His heart began to stir, and he found his gaze involuntarily following her.

He had always thought that a life where he needed caring from others was utterly meaningless and could end at any moment. Yet, because of her parting advice, he started to feel an urge to cherish his own life.

After a struggle, Zhong Shensheng managed to sit up from the ground. He extended his hands and grasped the handles of the wheelchair beside him. With a push and a twist, he effortlessly settled back into the chair.

It was evident that, despite his frail appearance, his arms were surprisingly strong, capable of supporting his entire body.

When Stella returned to Meixiang Park and made her way back to her rental apartment, she attracted countless glances along the way. 

There was no help for it; she was wearing light gray casual sports pants that clung to her legs after getting soaked, dripping water now and then. It was impossible for others not to notice.

Fortunately, while the pockets of her top were dampened, her phone, protected by its case, remained dry.

“System…” 

**[Call me Zhaocai! That’s the name you gave me, and I’ll use it forever!]**

“Alright, Zhaocai, let’s make a deal.”

Stella smiled and continued her mental conversation, “From now on, whenever we go out, can you scan for any men nearby and check if any of them are Heaven’s Chosen Ones?”

**[But that would be so tiring! I still have to give you tasks…]**

Stella agreed that it sounded exhausting. She recalled Li Qizhen, Lu Mingxu, and the man who had just jumped into the lake, and from these three, she identified a distinct common trait—they were all exceptionally good-looking.

“Then just scan for handsome men around me, like Li Qizhen,” Stella suggested.

**[Sure, no problem! You can count on me!]**

After returning to her rental, Stella hurriedly took a shower.

Once she finished, she busied herself in the kitchen preparing breakfast. 

Though she was an orphan, she hadn’t stepped foot in a kitchen in four years since starting university, mostly relying on the cafeteria or small stalls near her dorm for affordable meals. Consequently, her already mediocre cooking skills had deteriorated significantly.

She ended up making a pot of vegetable and egg noodles that turned out bland because she accidentally added too much water.

When she placed two bowls of noodles on the table, Zhaocai eagerly picked up chopsticks, slurping the noodles without any disdain for their insipid flavor.

Seeing Zhaocai enjoy the meal brought a smile to Stella’s face, and she decided against adding salt to the bowl, picking up her chopsticks to eat as well.

For the past few days, they had been indulging in rich foods and snacks, and while Zhaocai would be fine with such a diet, Stella worried about developing health issues from it.

If she did end up with health problems, how could she enjoy spending money then?

So, starting with this bowl of noodles, she decided to eat lighter for the next two days, considering it a way to cleanse and care for her body.

After arriving at the office, Stella was once again the center of attention, as she had worn a new outfit from the luxury brand.

The purple base of her black plaid cotton jacket complemented her matching form-fitting skirt, paired with black and white pointed sandals. She carried a purple sequined Maxi classic handbag.

The purple attire made her skin appear exceptionally fair, especially since she had been taking care of her skin recently, making her look radiant.

However, her makeup skills still left much to be desired; her eyeliner was uneven, ruining the rich girl vibe she was going for.

“Stella, your outfit today costs 130,000! And it's the latest spring/summer collection from the brand!” 

A colleague in the know gossiped with others around.

“That expensive! Yesterday it was 100,000, and today it’s 130,000! That’s a total of 230,000!”

“I can’t believe it! What she wore in two days could match my salary for over two and a half years!”

“I’d be eating dirt if I tried to buy even one bag from that luxury brand.”

“Wow, Stella, you look like a star today!”

Jin Linghua sidled up to Stella, excitedly saying.

“Don’t exaggerate, don’t exaggerate,” Stella smiled and waved her hand.

“I’m not exaggerating! Look!”

Jin Linghua promptly thrust her phone in front of Stella’s eyes.

On the screen, a fair-skinned, beautiful girl with silky black hair was dancing in an outfit identical to Stella's, on a stage illuminated by flashing lights.

Alongside her were several other stunning girls, all moving in perfect harmony, their strong vocal prowess adding to the captivating stage presence.

Stella felt a bit embarrassed, realizing she did indeed look like a star.

However, she noticed some differences in the clothing worn by the female celebrity in the video.

“The outfits seem a bit different,” Stella remarked.

“Right, they are different! Because this company’s stylists will intentionally modify high-end clothing to suit idols for their performances,” Jin Linghua replied with a smile.

This revelation startled Stella; high-end clothing was indeed expensive.

What if the modifications went wrong?

The idols in the video were performing songs from Hanyu, a girl group from Hanguo.

The entertainment company from Hanguo was truly generous in their investments.

Stella also observed that the designs for these modified outfits were unique and creative, showcasing the slender figures of the girls on stage perfectly, making one marvel at the skill of the stylist.

“They look great,” Stella sighed.

“I think they look wonderful too! In this regard, the entertainment companies in Huaguo don’t do as well. Not only do they spare no expense to dress their idols in luxury, but the design of their performance outfits is also tacky and outdated. It’s either bright red or Barbie pink, and the entire outfit is just one color without any creativity in color matching.”

Jin Linghua’s tone was filled with resentment, clearly dissatisfied with the state of female idols in Huaguo.

“Yuan Fei from my family left the girl group in Hanguo and returned to Huaguo. Although she earns more money now, her stage time has decreased significantly. What’s worse is that the quality of the outfits has declined, and the makeup looks utterly cheap!”

“Not everyone suits the grand and luxurious makeup style that Huaguo promotes. Some people are just more suited for a cute and versatile idol look; can’t they stop giving people unsuitable makeup?”

By the time she finished, Jin Linghua was so furious she was grinding her teeth. Stella hurriedly comforted her, saying, “Calm down, calm down! I may not understand the entertainment industry, but isn’t it a good thing that she’s earning more money?”

“Sure, she’s earning more, but the fire of her once burning dream has dimmed significantly.”

Stella found it difficult to comprehend since her original dream had always been to live without financial worries, and that dream had already been fulfilled by her Zhaocai.

Lately, she had developed a new dream of starting her own company. 

Even though she wanted to start a company to avoid being an employee, she also needed to make money.

From what she gathered from Jin Linghua, the entertainment industry seemed quite profitable. 

However, starting an entertainment company seemed to be quite costly too. After all, the fees for those stars were astronomical; could she even afford to develop them?

Thinking about it, Stella felt that the more than 40 million in her bank account wasn’t as substantial as she once thought.

**[Stella, don’t be disheartened! I’ll make sure to give you more money in the future!]**

Zhaocai vowed after sensing Stella’s thoughts.

“Okay, I’ll be waiting for that!” 

Stella happily responded to the system in her mind.

Unexpectedly, just as Zhaocai made the promise, it didn’t issue today’s daily task until Stella got off work and returned to her rental.

Wasn’t it supposed to give her more tasks?

She had already washed up and applied her skincare products.

If it didn’t issue a task soon, she would be heading to bed.

After returning home, Stella kept urging Zhaocai to issue a task, but the little kitten remained unresponsive.

Just as she was about to give up and lie down on her bed, Zhaocai suddenly shouted:

“Ding! Today’s daily task: spend 10,000 within 30 minutes!”

“Ding! Random task triggered: spend 1 million within an hour!”

Stella sprang up from her bed like a fish out of water, quickly throwing on a comfortable short-sleeve shirt and shorts.

Once she was ready, she dashed out the door while asking the system, “Zhaocai, why did you issue the tasks so late today? It’s already nine o'clock!”

“Because there are fewer people outside at this time, and I don’t have to expend too much energy detecting if there are any handsome men around you,” the system replied huffily, clearly wanting to take the easy route.
