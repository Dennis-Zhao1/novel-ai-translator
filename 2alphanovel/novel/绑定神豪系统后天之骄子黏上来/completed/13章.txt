**Hospital**

As Stella Ling found herself cradled in Lu Mingxu's arms, all she wanted was to wriggle away and jump down. However, the sharp pain in her calves left her body rigid, making even the slightest movement feel like an immense effort. Gritting her teeth against the agony, she pushed against Lu Mingxu’s chest in a futile attempt to block his approach and prevent him from carrying her into the car. But in her current state, it felt like a moth trying to stop a moving train.

Once inside the car, Stella sat in the passenger seat, desperate to call her counselor for help. Just as she fumbled to open her phone case, Lu Mingxu snatched her iPhone 13 from her grasp. 

"Don’t be scared. I’m not going to hurt you. I just want to take you to the hospital," he said, his voice steady yet urgent as he leaned in to fasten her seatbelt.

Noticing how tense Stella had become with his proximity, Lu Mingxu quickly pulled back, his handsome face marred by a bittersweet smile. Stella eyed him warily, every move he made scrutinized. When he got out of the car and returned with a bag, her heart raced. Inside were her shampoo and other belongings she had dropped when she fell earlier.

Lu Mingxu tossed the bag into the backseat before starting the car and driving away from the dormitory. The pain in Stella's calves consumed her thoughts, pushing everything else to the back of her mind as she leaned back against the seat, feeling drowsy.

"Does it hurt a lot? We’ll be at the hospital soon," he said, glancing at her. The sight of her pale face, slick with tears and sweat, tugged at his heartstrings. For the first time, he felt genuine concern for a woman.

Realizing that her current condition was a result of his actions, Lu Mingxu felt a wave of remorse wash over him. "I’m really sorry! I got drunk yesterday and acted inappropriately. I didn’t mean to offend you! I came to apologize."

Stella gritted her teeth, enduring the pain as she replied, "…Fine, I accept your apology." 

She wasn’t entirely sure if she should trust him, but if he had truly intended to retaliate, he would have done so already. She just wanted to put this whole incident behind her and live without fear. All she hoped was that after accepting his apology, he would leave her alone. 

Every time she crossed paths with him, something bad seemed to happen! 

As she mulled over this thought, her calves began to cramp violently again, the pain sharp and overwhelming, making her grimace as if she had bitten into a sour lemon. 

Oh, come on! Why won’t this cramping stop? 

Help! I’m in agony!!!

Just as Stella was engulfed in her latest wave of suffering, they finally arrived at the hospital. Lu Mingxu swiftly parked the car, scooping Stella into his arms and rushing inside.

He quickly placed a call, summoning the best neurologist from the Jing City Concord Hospital. Stella lay on the examination table, watching as a doctor in his fifties, with a receding hairline, bent down to examine her calves, which had stiffened due to the cramping. 

The sight of her pale legs, where the muscle was visibly contoured and deformed, evoked a feeling of pain that seemed to breathe.

"What caused this? How long has it been going on?" the doctor inquired.

"I think it was from running! It’s been nearly twenty minutes! I’ve given her some saline solution, but the cramps are still really bad!" Lu Mingxu answered urgently.

"What’s the prognosis, doctor? Will she recover today?" he asked, his gaze fixed on the doctor with worry.

"Of course," the doctor replied calmly. "But just drinking saline isn’t enough. She needs electrolytes—sodium, potassium, calcium, and so on. First, take her to orthopedics for a checkup, just to rule out anything else."

After a series of examinations, Stella lay exhausted on the hospital bed, an IV drip attached to her arm.

"Stella, are you still in pain?" Lu Mingxu asked, sitting beside her, concern etched on his face.

"…I’m feeling much better, thank you," she replied weakly. The cramps were still present, but thanks to the IV, the pain was no longer excruciating.

Seeing the girl he liked curled up on the hospital bed like a frail little kitten, Lu Mingxu felt an impulse to caress her face. However, as he raised his hand, memories of her earlier resistance held him back, and he settled for tucking the blanket around her instead.

A heavy silence fell between them.

Stella glanced around the single room, then remembered that he had covered her medical expenses. "I’ll pay you back for the hospital fees," she said, breaking the quiet.

"You don’t have to!" Lu Mingxu replied hastily.

"You ended up like this because of me. It’s the least I can do!" 

Stella shook her head slowly. "I caused this myself. I will pay you back; let’s exchange contact information."

Reflecting on how he had acted earlier, she realized that her reaction had been overly dramatic. His intentions today weren’t about revenge. Her leg troubles had stemmed from her own panic and the urge to escape.

Even though she didn’t have much money right now, she was determined to repay him for the hospital fees. She didn’t want to owe anyone anything, especially not a favor to the man sitting beside her.

Lu Mingxu initially intended to reject her offer, but when she suggested exchanging contact information, he quickly changed his mind. Although he already had her number, he hadn’t added her on WeChat yet. Plus, having a reason to stay connected would be beneficial for him. When the time came for her to return the money, he could simply refuse.

It would be best if that debt lingered indefinitely!

"Let’s add each other on WeChat," he suggested, pulling out his phone.

Stella’s phone was still with him. Instead of handing it over, he directly accessed her phone to add his WeChat account before returning it to her.

Once Stella had her phone back, she opened WeChat, hearing Lu Mingxu say, "I’m the one with the username ‘Rising Sun’."

As she stared at the newly added contact, doubt crept into her mind. 

Would a guy who chose a middle finger picture as his avatar genuinely apologize? 

Could he be playing her?

Just then, her stomach grumbled audibly, making her cheeks flush with embarrassment. Nonetheless, her pale complexion remained due to her discomfort.

"Wait here; I’ll go get you something to eat!" Lu Mingxu said before dashing out of the room, leaving Stella with no chance to stop him.

Great, not only was she going to owe him for the hospital, but now for food as well.

Once outside the room, Lu Mingxu hurriedly called one of his followers, Liang Yang, instructing him, "Quickly order two medicinal meals from Jinghai Hotel and bring them to Jing City Concord!"
