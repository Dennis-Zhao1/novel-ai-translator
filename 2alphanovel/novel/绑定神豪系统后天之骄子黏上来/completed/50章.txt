**Contract Termination**

In less than half an hour, Peng Lide arrived at the private dining restaurant with the contract and POS machine in tow. 

After another twenty minutes, Yang Zheng, the boss of the renovation company that Liu Dengfeng had contacted, also showed up with his own contract and POS machine. 

Following a quick introduction from Liu Dengfeng, Stella Ling and Yang Zheng shook hands, officially getting acquainted. 

Next, the three parties—Stella, Peng, and Yang—got down to business. 

Stella started by signing the land sublease agreement for the A-level 4S dealership in the High-tech Zone of Rongcheng with Peng Lide. She planned to pay Peng a total of 15,865,000 yuan, which included an additional 2.5 million yuan for the car purchase costs.

Peng Lide hesitated, wanting to refuse the payment as he had willingly offered Stella a discount of 2.5 million yuan. “Miss Ling, you really don’t need to pay me this amount,” he insisted.

“Come on, President Peng, just accept it. This 2.5 million is more than enough to cover a year’s worth of land lease fees. If you keep refusing, I might think twice about shopping at your store next time,” Stella replied with a smile, making it clear she wasn’t trying to take advantage of him. 

The thought of this middle-aged man potentially going home in tears over a loss of 2.5 million made her feel a bit guilty. After all, money didn’t just fall from the sky; it was earned through hard work. 

“But…” Peng Lide was torn. Deep down, he did want to accept the money. However, Miss Ling was a top-tier connection that Old Liu had specifically introduced to him—someone others would jump at the chance to meet. 

The 2.5 million was initially a voluntary discount; asking for it back would seem inappropriate and would also put Old Liu’s reputation on the line. 

“President Peng, just take it. I have no qualms about the 2.5 million. Instead of giving me a discount, how about you introduce me to some rare high-end custom cars when I visit your store? That way, I’ll be happy with my purchases, and you can still make a profit. It’s a win-win situation for both of us—there’s no sense in letting one party take all the losses,” Stella suggested.

This was not the first time Liu Dengfeng had heard Stella make such a proposal. If Old Peng refused again, it would seem a bit pretentious, so Liu chimed in, “Old Peng, just accept it. Miss Ling wants to be your friend.” 

With Old Liu’s encouragement, Peng Lide felt embarrassed to continue refusing and finally agreed, “Alright then, I’ll accept the payment.” 

“Miss Ling, from now on, you’ll be our top VIP customer at Tengfei 4S. No one else will surpass your status. I promise to inform you first when we get any new high-end custom cars in stock so you can pick them out first.” 

“Thank you, President Peng,” Stella replied with a smile, satisfied with the arrangement. 

“No need to be so polite, Miss Ling. What I’m doing is nothing compared to the help you’ve given me,” Peng Lide waved his hand, downplaying his efforts. 

Following this, Stella shifted the conversation to Yang Zheng, discussing the establishment of a luxurious indoor sports facility linked to the 4S dealership. 

“Mr. Yang, while we’re calling it a sports facility, the main purpose is to create a stage for our artists to perform,” Stella explained. 

“I want this indoor sports facility to be on par with the Cang Room Indoor Sports Facility in Hanguo.” 

“I know that the land I’m offering is 2,000 square meters smaller than that facility, but I hope the aesthetics and various amenities of ours will surpass it!” 

“I’m prepared to allocate a budget of 34,135,000 yuan. If that’s not enough, I can add more.” 

“That's more than enough! Completely sufficient!” Yang Zheng quickly raised his hand to express his gratitude. Knowing that such a budget was generous, he wouldn’t dare claim it wasn’t enough—doing so would imply he was taking advantage of someone inexperienced. 

Besides, this was a big client introduced by Liu Ge, who had warned Yang in a WeChat message to treat her with utmost respect. 

Understanding that Miss Ling had a deep background, Yang Zheng was determined to complete her project with diligence. 

“Miss Ling, do you have any requirements regarding the construction timeline?” Yang Zheng asked. 

“I hope it can be done as quickly as possible, ideally within six months,” Stella replied. 

“Sure, with the funds you’ve provided, if we work overtime, completing it in three months is definitely possible,” Yang Zheng considered, nodding. 

“That would be wonderful,” Stella smiled in response. 

With everything settled, Stella and Yang Zheng signed the renovation project agreement. 

After both contracts were completed, Stella pulled out her American Express Black Card to claim her reward, swiping it on the POS machines brought by Peng and Yang. 

When Peng Lide saw the black card, his eyes widened in astonishment. 

It looked just like the American Express Black Card he had seen online—the one that only 100 exist in the world, reserved for heads of state, billionaires, and social elites! 

Witnessing Stella use it to make a purchase left him feeling excited. 

A week later, Stella finally received her company’s business license.

This meant her company was now able to post job listings online! 

However, since the company was still undergoing renovations, there was no point in hiring staff when they wouldn’t have anywhere to work. 

Stella decided it was best to head to Jing City first to pay the termination fees for Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng, sign them on as her employees, and maybe even scout some talent from entertainment companies nearby. 

With a light heart, Stella boarded her flight to Jing City. 

The plane landed at 11:20 AM. 

As soon as she disembarked, Stella sent a WeChat message to Xu Shujun. 

At that moment, Xu Shujun was sweating it out in the dance studio at Huihua Entertainment with Fang Yao and others, practicing tirelessly. 

Their dance teacher, Tian Rui, was supervising from the side. 

At 11:30, Tian Rui turned off the music, clapped her hands, and called for the trainees to take a break and have lunch. 

Xu Shujun, out of breath, grabbed her towel from the stretching bench, wiping the sweat from her face. 

Just then, Tian Rui walked over and patted Xu Shujun on the shoulder, praising her, “Shujun, your dancing has really improved; it’s like you’ve been infused with new life.” 

“Have you encountered some good fortune recently? You’re not in love, are you?” 

Hearing her teacher's question, Xu Shujun smiled subtly, “No, Teacher Tian. I spend all day in the dance studio practicing; when would I have time to date?” 

Tian Rui was only joking, well aware of the girl’s daily schedule. Other than eating and sleeping, dancing consumed her life—there was simply no time for romance. 

Tian Rui gave Xu Shujun’s shoulder another encouraging pat, inviting her, “Let’s go eat.” 

“Okay,” Xu Shujun nodded in agreement. 

Afterward, she bent down to grab her phone from the stretching bench. 

Even though she was drenched in sweat, it wouldn’t be appropriate to shower right after dancing. 

When a person sweats, their pores open up. Sudden exposure to external stimuli can cause the pores to constrict, which might lead to catching a cold. 

It’s best to shower about an hour after exercising, allowing the body to recover somewhat, which is beneficial for health. 

Even the timing of drinking water is best arranged about ten minutes after exercising. 

So, Xu Shujun could only put up with her sweaty state, feeling both hungry and thirsty, while following Tian Rui to find food. 

Walking behind Tian Rui, Xu Shujun slowly strolled along and opened her phone to check WeChat. 

During this period, Xu Shujun had been keeping up with the renovation progress photos of Xingchen Entertainment that Stella had been posting in their group chat. 

Only by seeing those photos did she feel a sense of reality, confirming that she had indeed been recruited by the president of an entertainment company. 

However, when Xu Shujun saw the new messages in the group, she suddenly felt her current life become surreal and somewhat unreal. 

She pinched her face hard, and upon feeling the pain, Xu Shujun stood there blankly for a long moment. 

It wasn’t until Tian Rui, who had walked ahead, turned around and called for her that Xu Shujun snapped back to reality. 

Hurrying to catch up with Tian Rui, she looked at her dance teacher, who she had interacted with for two years, feeling an unexpected lump in her throat. 

“What’s wrong?” 

Tian Rui asked with concern, “Did something happen at home?” 

“No, everything’s fine at home.” 

Xu Shujun hesitated for two seconds and then looked up, her gaze steady as she told Tian Rui, “Teacher Tian, I might be leaving Huihua.” 

“...Why? Don’t you want to continue pursuing your dream?” 

Tian Rui asked, puzzled. 

She knew the entertainment industry had been tumultuous lately, and it was no longer as easy for trainees to break through. 

The company wasn’t placing much emphasis on capable trainees like Xu Shujun, instead focusing resources on pretty faces. 

But hadn’t Xu Shujun always been tenaciously pursuing her dreams? 

Her dancing had improved significantly; how could she suddenly want to give up and leave? 

“Teacher, I’m not giving up on my dreams. I plan to leave Huihua and join another company.” 

Xu Shujun explained, then shared the story of how she met Stella Ling. 

After hearing this, Tian Rui looked skeptical, “You’re not being scammed, are you?” 

“No! I trust President Ling!” 

Xu Shujun replied firmly and then looked at Tian Rui, “Teacher, I can’t go eat with you; I have to wait here for President Ling.” 

“Then I’ll wait with you.” 

Tian Rui gently patted Xu Shujun’s shoulder, indicating her support. 

She still had some concerns about Xingchen Entertainment, doubting whether President Ling was genuine. 

Even if the contract termination fees were covered, what if Xingchen Entertainment turned out to be another Huihua or even worse? 

She needed to thoroughly investigate for her student’s sake. 

The two of them arrived at the company’s entrance, and after a short wait, they saw a young woman in casual shorts and a t-shirt getting out of a taxi. 

The woman raised her arm and waved when she saw Xu Shujun. 

Tian Rui looked at the girl running toward them with uncertainty, turning to Xu Shujun to confirm, “Is she President Ling? She looks so young!” 

“Yes!” 

Xu Shujun nodded happily, unable to resist running toward Stella’s cheerful figure. 

“Just wait over there; no need to come over here.” 

Stella playfully scolded, her excitement evident. “Let’s go inside to terminate the contract. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time!” 

As they passed by Tian Rui, Xu Shujun grabbed Stella and introduced her, “President Ling, this is Teacher Tian.” 

“Teacher Tian, this is President Ling.” 

Tian Rui looked at Stella with suspicion, “You’re the president of Xingchen Entertainment, Stella Ling?” 

“Indeed! And you must be Teacher Tian, right? Shujun often mentions you, saying you teach her dance very well and take good care of her!” 

At this, Stella glanced at Tian Rui with a hint of regret. 

She was quite pretty but probably in her thirties already. 

The girl group industry thrived on youth; if Tian Rui were a decade younger, Stella might have considered bringing her into her company as a member of the girl group. 

Of course, there was one prerequisite: Tian Rui’s potential score would have to be above nine. 

Hearing this, Tian Rui pursed her lips, noticing the closeness between the two. Was Xu Shujun really going to switch to another company? 

Stella didn’t linger on the conversation with Tian Rui; she was eager to terminate Xu Shujun’s contract and pulled the future star toward Huihua Entertainment’s owner. 

Five minutes later, Stella sat face-to-face with Mi Jie, an agent from Huihua Entertainment, both observing each other across the desk. 

Dressed in cotton floral white shorts and a black t-shirt, the girl before her looked like a recent college graduate. 

So this was Xu Shujun’s sister, coming to terminate her contract? 

It appeared that Xu Shujun couldn’t handle the pressure and had decided to abandon her dreams. 

Given her looks, even if she debuted, she probably wouldn’t find success, so why continue to struggle in this industry? 

“You must be Xu Shujun’s sister. If you want to terminate her contract, you’ll need to pay the fees first. Our company’s contract termination process requires payment before signing the termination agreement,” Mi Jie said slowly. 

Stella nodded in agreement. She reached into her vintage white leather handbag, pulled out her wallet, and took out a platinum card. “Where’s the POS machine?” 

“Just a moment.” 

Mi Jie opened her desk drawer, retrieved a POS machine, turned it on, and placed it on the desk. 

Stella swiped her card, realizing the single transaction limit was only 50,000 yuan, so she swiped three more times. 

After seeing the money transfer, Mi Jie immediately took out a file from her drawer, extracted Xu Shujun’s contract, and handed it to Stella before turning to prepare the termination agreement. 

Once the termination agreement was printed, Mi Jie signed it and placed her seal before pushing the pen and inkpad toward Stella. 

Stella looked at Xu Shujun, urging her, “Shujun, hurry up and sign!” 

“Oh, right!” 

Xu Shujun nodded, took the pen, and with a slight tremble, signed her name on the termination agreement, pressing her seal beside it. 

Mission accomplished! 

Stella cheered internally, but then heard Mi Jie speak up, “Xu Shujun, you’re free now. You can go wherever you want, and the company can’t interfere. But as someone who has been in this industry for a long time, I want to give you a piece of advice: with your current conditions, you won’t make it in this industry. Don’t think about signing with another company; it won’t help! Either you’ll be scammed for training fees, or you’ll find yourself stuck until you willingly pay termination fees to leave the company. Why bother?” 

Stella didn’t appreciate Mi Jie’s words and stood up abruptly, raising her voice, “My sister’s future is none of your concern! I will take good care of her!” 

“Please don’t be upset. I’m just a straightforward person who likes to speak the truth.” 

Mi Jie stood up and acknowledged Stella’s protective nature toward her sister, feeling a mix of respect and pity. 

Having a sister who didn’t focus on her studies but was always chasing dreams would undoubtedly cause some headaches for the family, especially after spending 200,000 yuan. 

After taking a glance at Mi Jie, Stella calmed her anger and smiled slightly, “Speaking of which, I’m quite curious—what makes the entertainment industry so alluring that my sister is so dedicated to it? I’d love to take a tour of the place she’s been for the past two years.” 

With that, Stella turned to Mi Jie and asked, “Sister, could you show me around your company? I want to see the talented artists you have. I want to understand where my sister might be lacking. While she may have given up hope, I haven’t. I still believe in her and that she can make a name for herself in the entertainment industry!” 

“Wow! What you’re saying is love, but it sounds more like harm!” 

Mi Jie exclaimed in genuine surprise and waved her hand. “Alright, come with me. I’ll show you our company’s debut artists so you can see for yourself!” 

Stella felt a surge of joy upon hearing this. 

That was exactly what she wanted! 

She was determined to recruit all the talented artists with scores above nine from Mi Jie’s company!
