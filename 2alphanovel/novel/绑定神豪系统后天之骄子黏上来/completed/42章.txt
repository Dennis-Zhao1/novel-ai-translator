**Out of Control**

In a modest 57-square-meter apartment, a young woman was intently browsing on her phone, searching for the term "Feather Jewelry." 

“Not this, not this either,” she muttered to herself, scrolling through the results with a furrowed brow.

Just then, another girl emerged from the bathroom, her wet hair cascading down her shoulders and her skin glowing with moisture, clearly just out of the shower.

“Jia Yi, are you still looking?” 

As she dried her hair with a towel slung around her neck, she peered over at her friend.

“Yeah,” Li Jia Yi replied, still focused on her phone.

“Didn’t Fang Yao say that the girl was decked out in LV? Maybe the jewelry is from LV too,” the girl suggested.

“Nope, I already checked. LV doesn’t have that jewelry,” Li Jia Yi replied.

“What are you searching for?” 

“Feather Jewelry. Why?” Li Jia Yi asked, slightly puzzled.

“Try searching for Peacock Feather Jewelry,” her friend urged.

“Alright… got it!” Li Jia Yi exclaimed, her voice bubbling with excitement as she tapped her screen.

The other girl abandoned her hair-drying and hurried to sit beside Li Jia Yi, eager to see the results.

“Gem Cage! That’s a super famous jewelry brand!” 

“Those Peacock Feather Diamond Earrings alone cost over a hundred thousand! And the bracelet in that set is the most expensive—adding in the ring and necklace, the total value of that girl’s jewelry is over a million!” 

Li Jia Yi’s eyes widened as she continued reading, her tone turning envious. “Xu Shujun really hit the jackpot. How lucky can one get to be noticed by the president of an entertainment company!”

A flicker of jealousy crossed the face of the girl beside her as she urged, “Look up Xingchen Entertainment and see what kind of big name they are.”

Li Jia Yi immediately complied, but after a moment, she disappointedly reported, “…Nothing.”

“How is that possible? Even a small company like Huihua shows up online. With over a million worth of jewelry, how could the company she works for be so unknown?” the girl expressed her disbelief.

Huihua was the name of the agency signed by Xu Shujun and Fang Yao along with a few others. They were proud to be selected from a sea of trainees, even if they looked down on their own agency.

At least it wasn’t a scam company demanding training fees, and they received a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan.

However, the agency was quite small, providing limited resources for the trainees. 

When a major talent show was announced, Huihua signed up immediately, prompting the trainees to prepare. They thought they finally had a chance to debut and shine like their predecessors.

But unexpectedly, when the boss made a statement, their dreams shattered in an instant, like bubbles bursting. Their carefully prepared dance routine could no longer be showcased.

In their group of trainees, they had previously maintained a facade of camaraderie, as the company planned to debut all six of them together for the show. Any discord could jeopardize their practice progress.

Now that their debut dreams were in ruins, Fang Yao had dropped the pretenses and had been targeting Xu Shujun for days. 

Their dance instructor often praised Xu Shujun for her talent and grace. Initially, the others felt somewhat disgruntled, believing they could catch up with hard work.

Yet no matter how hard they tried, they could never match Xu Shujun, who remained the instructor’s favorite.

The instructor even bluntly stated that in terms of dancing talent, there was an insurmountable gap between Xu Shujun and the rest of them, one that they would never bridge.

While the instructor's words might have been true, who wouldn’t feel resentment toward Xu Shujun after hearing such things?

The least attractive member of the group had an extraordinary talent in dance.

They had previously comforted themselves with the notion that the entertainment industry valued looks and personas; if you didn’t have the looks, even talent was of no use.

But who could have predicted that Xu Shujun would catch the eye of a female president from an entertainment company, who personally came to invite her?

From that moment on, they could no longer deceive themselves, secretly mocking Xu Shujun for her looks. 

Because in the entertainment world, as long as an artist could connect with resources, even someone as unattractive as a pig could be pushed to fame if they had the right support. 

Moreover, Xu Shujun wasn’t even unattractive.

Li Jia Yi had thought that if Xingchen Entertainment was better than Huihua, she could build a good relationship with Xu Shujun in the coming days, hoping the latter would help her out and possibly take her to the new company.

But this company was completely unknown online!

“Could that girl be a scammer?” Li Jia Yi speculated.

“What would she want to scam Xu Shujun for?” the other girl replied, puzzled. “If she were going to scam someone, shouldn’t it be someone prettier?”

If the woman’s intention was to scam for training fees, she had also promised to pay Xu Shujun’s termination fee.

Just then, the door rattled as Xu Shujun returned.

Li Jia Yi and the other girl immediately jumped up from the couch as two more girls walked out of the room.

Everyone except Fang Yao was gathered at the door, waiting for Xu Shujun to step into the apartment.

Upon opening the door, Xu Shujun was startled to see the four girls huddled at the entrance.

Before she could say anything, they pulled her onto the sofa, bombarding her with questions about the young woman’s identity, her intentions, and whether she was a bad person who needed their help.

The feigned concern on their faces made Xu Shujun feel nauseated.

Xu Shujun was clear-headed; their surface concern was merely a guise to see if they could leverage her connection to President Ling for their own benefit, so they pretended to be friends and inquired out of “concern.”

Normally, this group would barely hide their glee at her misfortunes, so why would she believe they genuinely cared about her?

Seeing Xu Shujun silent, the two girls who had just joined them assumed she was afraid they would snatch her opportunity. One of them immediately softened her tone, pleading, “Shujun, please don’t be like this. We joined the company on the same day and have worked hard together for two years. If you have a good opportunity, please help me out. I really need a chance.”

“Yeah, Shujun, we really need opportunities! Fang Yao has been targeting you on purpose these past few days because the company values her. We didn’t dare approach you for fear of being targeted too. I really realize my mistakes now!”

Xu Shujun remained silent.

As the two girls were about to continue with their flattery, Li Jia Yi interjected with a scoff, “Why beg her? Can’t you see? That girl is a scammer! There’s no company named Xingchen Entertainment online at all.”

Li Jia Yi had lost count of how many homophones for “xingchen” she had searched, and the results had nothing to do with any entertainment company.

Xu Shujun still said nothing. She rose from the couch, pushed past the girls blocking her, and headed straight to her room.

“Bang!” 

The sound of her door slamming shut made the other two girls rush over to Li Jia Yi, asking, “Jia Yi, is what you said true? There really is no company named Xingchen Entertainment?”

“None! I’ve guessed that the woman’s designer clothes are probably fake, and she’s just trying to act the part,” Li Jia Yi said with a mocking tone, crossing her arms and looking at Xu Shujun’s closed door.

“Really? Even worse than our current company? Then I got my hopes up for nothing…”

The other girls instantly deflated, their slippers shuffling as they turned back to their rooms.

The girl who had been discussing Xu Shujun’s attire with Li Jia Yi approached, expressing concern, “Jia Yi, don’t be like that. What if it’s real? If you offend her and she doesn’t help us later, what will we do?”

Li Jia Yi waved her hand dismissively. “Come on, look at her! Even if it were true, she wouldn’t let us take advantage of her.”

“Even if she’s lucky enough to debut before us, do you really think her looks will carry her far? Honestly, she should just give up on her dream of debuting and go become a dance teacher. Didn’t Teacher Tian always praise her dancing skills?” 

After saying her piece with a tone full of sarcasm, Li Jia Yi returned to her own room, leaving the other girl alone on the sofa, looking troubled.

Yes, Xu Shujun dances beautifully; even if she doesn’t debut, she can make a living teaching others.

But what about them?

Among the five of them, only Fang Yao had decent looks, but even those weren’t outstanding in the entertainment world.

If there were any exceptionally pretty faces among the trainees, they would’ve been snatched up and turned into actors long ago. What would happen to them if they couldn’t even make it as trainees?

Their singing and dancing skills were nothing remarkable; they held no qualifications to teach, and their grades weren’t good. If they couldn’t be trainees anymore, what on earth would they do?

They could work in factories or serve dishes in restaurants, right?

Or, they could become internet celebrities.

Becoming an internet celebrity had no entry barriers; it was a decent option.

But being an internet celebrity wasn’t easy either. Those who became famous often had clear communication skills or unique talents.

Moreover, who would want to settle for being an internet celebrity after experiencing the hustle and bustle of the entertainment industry?

Those internet celebrities were waiting for opportunities, just like them, to push their way into the entertainment world.

Why couldn’t Jia Yi understand that they were the ones with no way out? They had no right to mock Xu Shujun.

Xu Shujun lay quietly on her bed.

In her small five-square-meter room, which didn’t even have a window, she could hear even the tiniest sounds from the neighbors, making it impossible not to overhear Li Jia Yi’s taunts.

Xu Shujun knew those jabs were meant for her to hear.

If President Ling hadn’t mentioned that Xingchen Entertainment wasn’t operational yet during their meal, she might have felt doubtful or anxious upon hearing that.

However, she knew better, so she simply brushed off Li Jia Yi’s words.

She had already accepted Ling Xiaoxing’s invitation, and she had been promised that once the company was established, she would be helped out of her contract with Huihua.

A C-POP girl group even more powerful than the top-tier K-POP idols!

Just the thought of it made Xu Shujun’s heart race with excitement.

If only Xingchen Entertainment could launch tomorrow…

Li Qicheng stared at the investigation report on Ling Xiaoxing that his assistant had submitted, feeling increasingly uneasy.

Since sending a message the previous day, he hadn’t received a response, leading him to suspect that Xiaoxing might know he had been following her.

The report he had just received revealed that Xiaoxing’s identity was far more complicated than he had imagined.

How could a girl with no connections suddenly become wealthy overnight?

Her wardrobe and spending habits had skyrocketed.

According to the investigation, Xiaoxing had inherited a fortune from a relative living abroad. 

But when had she met that suddenly emerging relative, and when had she handled the inheritance? His people couldn’t find any trace of it.

Did this mean the rumors coming from “Bai Xue” Company were true? 

A colleague of Xiaoxing had mentioned that her true identity was that of a rich girl, someone from a similar background as him.

The thought that they might be evenly matched made Li Qicheng momentarily pleased.

That way, his family wouldn’t intervene in his romantic affairs.

Yet, why did he feel more and more anxious?

Even if they came from similar backgrounds, shouldn’t he have uncovered any information?

Or perhaps Xiaoxing’s family background was even more remarkable than the Li family’s.

There were indeed prominent Chinese families thriving abroad, many of which were based in the United States.

These conditions seemed to match up.

However, it appeared there was no family with the surname Ling among them.

Could it be from Xiaoxing’s mother’s side of the family?

Regardless, Li Qicheng understood that he shouldn’t continue his investigation any further.

Because Xiaoxing might discover his actions, and he didn’t want her to dislike him.

Even though he hated the feeling of losing control, it was far worse to be hated by the person he cared about.

At least, Xiaoxing hadn’t deleted him from WeChat yet, which meant he still had a chance, right?

That Lu Mingxu, who didn’t even have Xiaoxing’s contact information, had the audacity to pursue her.

He had heard Lu Mingxu was no longer interested in nightlife, and there were even rumors from the Lu family that he wanted to turn over a new leaf and strive for success.

Old Master Lu had cried tears of joy, hosting several banquets, proudly telling friends that his son had finally matured.

Though Li Qicheng didn’t like Lu Mingxu, especially since they were both after the same woman, he despised the two Lu brothers even more for trying to take advantage of the situation.

Recently, they had frequently invited him out, but Li Qicheng had found excuses to decline.

He could guess their intentions; they wanted him to help deal with Lu Mingxu, who had suddenly turned over a new leaf.

These two were laughable, truly thinking that Old Master Lu had become too old to care.

He wouldn’t help them; in fact, he wanted to assist Lu Mingxu.

Li Qicheng hoped Lu Mingxu would engage more with the Lu family’s business, ideally keeping him too busy to interfere when it came to Xiaoxing.

“Xiaoxing, I’ve found out that your bank account is under investigation,” the little cat, Zhaocai, chomped on a king crab leg, taking a break to speak.

“Who is it?” Ling Xiaoxing’s heart raced with caution.

Could it be Guo Jia?

Hadn’t Zhaocai said before that the money it transferred to her wouldn’t raise any red flags?

“It’s Li Qicheng, and there’s also someone with the surname Zhong—the one who pretended to faint that day,” Zhaocai replied, licking its paw to clean off the crab meat, then reassuring Xiaoxing while munching on shrimp, “Xiaoxing, don’t worry about any financial matters. No matter who investigates your account, they won’t find anything wrong, I promise!”
