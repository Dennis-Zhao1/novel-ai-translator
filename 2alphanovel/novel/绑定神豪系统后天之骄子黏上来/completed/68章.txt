**Continuous Efforts**

The trending news about the Beidou Girl Group from Xingchen Entertainment had been plastered across various online platforms all night long. By the time the Mid-Autumn Festival rolled around the next day, it had only dropped one spot to second place in the trending topics. The top spot was taken by a news piece featuring national leaders wishing the entire nation a happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Who would dare to compete with that headline? Only a fool would try.

Most of the internet users who watched the Beidou Girl Group's live stream and recordings the previous night had little interest in discussing the festival. They were far more eager to know about Xingchen Entertainment, the powerhouse behind the creation of "Super Star," and when the Beidou Girl Group would hold their second live performance.

On Weibo's trending comments section for the second hot topic, the comments flowed in:

"That wasn’t even a real live stream! The whole thing didn’t even last ten minutes. Xingchen Entertainment, do you even know what a live stream is? Hurry up and give us another 100-minute show. I advise you not to underestimate us!”

"The girls from the Beidou Girl Group are so beautiful! I’m officially your loyal fan from now on!"

"Brothers are fans too~ Happy Mid-Autumn Festival~"

"Happy Mid-Autumn Festival! Let’s have another live stream today!"

"Your songs are amazing! When will the audio version be released?"

"Hurry up and release the audio version!"

……

"I’ve never seen a girl group with such diverse members before. Thumbs up!"

"I heard the Beidou members aren’t just Uyghur girls; there are also girls from the Mongolian, Korean, and Bai ethnic groups!"

"From today onward, Beidou is my Super Star! Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!"

Stella Ling scrolled through the Weibo comments, her lips curling up into an involuntary smile. Just then, her senior, Zhang Aiyue, knocked and entered the office. Upon seeing the younger girl lost in her phone, she couldn't help but chuckle. Once Stella noticed her, Aiyue immediately shared some great news: "The recorded video of Beidou's 'Super Star' has already surpassed 3 million views on Douyin!"

"That’s amazing!" Stella exclaimed, beaming with joy.

Zhang Aiyue had joined her from Baixue Cosmetics last month, and Stella had also managed to recruit her friend, Jin Linghua. The two were now working in the comprehensive marketing department of Xingchen Entertainment, handling market promotion just like they had before.

Stella had initially planned to recruit her best friend, An Liyu, to work with them, but Liyu, majoring in Russian, was only interested in pursuing a career related to her field and had turned down Stella's invitation. Now, Liyu was working at a trade company in Russia, and they often kept in touch via WeChat.

"Senior, tonight at 8 PM, make sure to upload the videos we shot to all platforms. Don’t forget the international YouTube platform too. We need to send over the recording of Beidou's 'Super Star' as well," Stella instructed.

"Got it," Aiyue nodded in agreement, though she hesitated and asked, "Do those foreigners understand the video content?"

"Whether they understand or not doesn’t matter; they just need to watch it. There are plenty of Chinese people living abroad, and I believe this video will definitely go viral," Stella replied confidently.

Even if the foreigners initially struggled to accept it, they would eventually be drawn in by the alluring pastoral visuals of the video. Tonight at 8 PM, Xingchen Entertainment was set to release a video shot by Stella, imitating the popular influencer Li Ziqi from a parallel universe.

In that alternate reality, Li Ziqi was an immensely popular Chinese internet celebrity, even praised by major state media for her positive role in promoting traditional Chinese culture. Stella was determined to create the first top girl group in China and attract global attention, so she couldn't miss out on such a wonderful promotional opportunity!

At 8 PM sharp, Xingchen Entertainment released Stella’s beautifully shot video across major online platforms.

Wu Xiaomei was a Chinese girl living in the U.S. Her family had moved there when she was eight. Since childhood, she had learned Chinese, but she faced numerous challenges learning English after moving to the States. Now, at 20, she spoke English as fluently as Chinese, but she still found life in America to be quite an adjustment.

She missed her grandparents back home in China and longed for her childhood friends. Unfortunately, her parents’ work kept them in the U.S., and they had even taken American citizenship, making it impossible for her to go back...

On this Mid-Autumn Festival, Wu Xiaomei's family would typically eat mooncakes and call their relatives in China. However, she found the mooncakes sold at the Chinese supermarket in America to be quite disappointing, as they bore no resemblance to the ones she had enjoyed in her childhood.

Although the Mid-Autumn Festival was meant to be a time for family reunions, Wu Xiaomei could only settle for eating unsatisfactory mooncakes in a foreign land. Now, she could only learn about her hometown through the internet to alleviate her homesickness.

While aimlessly browsing YouTube for videos related to China, Wu Xiaomei was suddenly captivated by an exquisite video thumbnail. The title read, "Seven Fairies—Crispy Pastry, Juicy Filling, Soulful Fresh Meat Mooncake."

Meat-filled mooncakes! 

"Yes! That’s what I used to eat as a child! But they don’t sell those here in America!" she exclaimed, her excitement bubbling over. Without hesitation, she clicked on the video.

As the video started, a carpet of delicate yellow flowers filled her vision. She recognized these flowers—osmanthus, which looked quite similar to the bay laurel back in the U.S. 

In the next moment, she saw seven girls dressed in beautifully distinct outfits ascending steps strewn with osmanthus flowers. Each girl carried a woven basket on her arm, picking yellow and white osmanthus blossoms beneath a lush tree.

The background music was enchanting, radiating a distinctly Chinese vibe. The girls picking the flowers were stunning, their flowing robes making them look ethereal and otherworldly.

In the next scene, the girls’ baskets were filled with osmanthus blossoms, shimmering like scattered gold. Wu Xiaomei sighed, "Oh, they could’ve just kept filming this; I could watch them pick flowers for an hour!"

The video then shifted to an osmanthus grove. Watching the trees and flowers sway gently in the breeze, Wu Xiaomei held her breath, utterly mesmerized. It was so beautiful!

The girls left the grove and found themselves in a charming courtyard filled with vibrant flowers and vegetables, resembling a paradise. They began to divide their tasks among themselves: some were washing utensils, others were moving unfamiliar items, while some were gathering fruits and vegetables from the garden, each busy with their own duties.

Wu Xiaomei watched as they placed osmanthus, red dates, rock sugar, and some unfamiliar dried herbs into a large jar. 

"Are they brewing medicinal wine?" she wondered. Her dad would buy a bottle of peculiar medicinal wine from the Chinese supermarket every year. 

"Using flowers to brew wine? How romantic!" she mused.

Soon, the scene transformed to nighttime in the video. The girls gathered in a kitchen that looked rather old-fashioned, lacking the modern conveniences of a typical kitchen. Yet, Wu Xiaomei felt that this kitchen looked far more appealing than hers at home.

They were kneading dough—were they about to make meat-filled mooncakes? Wu Xiaomei sat up straight, focusing intently on the girls’ actions in the video, hoping to learn how to make meat-filled mooncakes. However, she couldn’t recognize all the ingredients, so she could only watch helplessly as the scenes flowed past her like a river.

"It's so beautiful! Watching them cook is pure enjoyment!" Wu Xiaomei exclaimed.

As the round, flat pieces of dough were placed onto a pan resembling a baking tray, she couldn’t help but swallow hard. She had just seen them stuffing the adorable dough rounds with heaps of meat—surely it would smell amazing!

Moments later, the mooncakes in the video were ready, and one girl began transferring them onto a wooden plate. 

In an instant, a bright full moon filled Wu Xiaomei's eyes. 

The scene then shifted to a dining table. On the long wooden table, alongside the freshly made meat-filled mooncakes, there was an array of delicious dishes and fruits. The jar of osmanthus wine also adorned the table.

The girls gathered around the long table, each holding a piece of mooncake. One girl broke open a mooncake, revealing an overflowing meat filling.

"Wow! I’m about to drool!" Wu Xiaomei exclaimed, her eyes glued to the screen.

The video didn’t capture the girls eating the mooncakes; instead, they took their handmade pomelo lanterns to the riverside. Each girl placed her pomelo lantern onto the water.

Watching the floating pomelo lanterns drift on the river, Wu Xiaomei cradled her face in her hands, feeling envious. She wanted to release a pomelo lantern too.

After placing the lanterns, the girls all looked up at the moon together. The camera zoomed in on the full moon, getting closer and closer.

Suddenly, one of the girls’ silhouettes appeared in the moon, as she made mooncakes with her family. The mooncake’s edges featured decorative patterns, with the center showcasing a large moon with the character "月" embedded in it.

As the bright moon rose, the long-haired girl began to burn incense and pray to the moon. The whole family enjoyed mooncakes and fruits while an elder narrated folklore stories, all while gazing at the moon and watching sky lanterns float up.

At that moment, a caption appeared beside the girl, indicating that she was from the Bai ethnic group of China.

The camera then zoomed in on the moon again, where another girl appeared. Dressed in traditional attire similar to what Wu Xiaomei had seen in Han-Guk historical dramas, she was busy preparing food with her family.

They placed steamed glutinous rice into a stone trough, using a wooden pestle to pound it rhythmically, "bang, bang, bang..." The steady rhythm filled the courtyard with a festive and joyous atmosphere.

Next, they began to construct a "moon-viewing platform" using wooden poles and pine branches. As the bright moon ascended, selected elders climbed the platform to appreciate the moon. Afterward, they ignited the platform, beat drums, played flutes, and began to dance together.

A subtitle appeared beside the girl with her hair tied up, indicating that she belonged to the Korean ethnic group of China.

"Ah? So she’s not from Han-Guk!" Wu Xiaomei exclaimed in surprise, genuinely unaware that there were such ethnic groups in China.

Once more, the camera shifted to the moon, where it zoomed in, revealing a vast grassland. The sound of galloping horses filled the air, and the scene changed to a girl riding a majestic white horse, racing across the grassland.

Wu Xiaomei suddenly realized that the girl in the video was galloping after the bright moon, chasing after it!

A caption appeared, indicating that the girl on horseback was from the Mongolian ethnic group of China.

The scene shifted back to the seven girls, who gradually walked towards a brightly lit high platform by the river. They climbed up and sang to the moon together:

"When will the bright moon appear? I raise my glass to ask the sky. 
I wonder what year it is in the heavenly palaces tonight. 
I wish to ride the wind to return, but I fear the jade tower is too high 
And too cold. 
Dancing and playing with my shadow, how is it like in the mortal realm? 
Turning the vermillion pavilion, lowering the intricate windows, shining on my sleepless self. 
There should be no hate; why must we part when the moon is full? 
People experience joy and sorrow, separation and reunion; 
The moon has its phases of brightness and dimness, 
Such matters have always been hard to come by. 
I only wish for longevity; may we share the beauty of the moon, even thousands of miles apart."

As they began to dance gracefully during the second verse, it felt as if they were about to ride the wind and soar away:

"I wish to ride the wind to return, but I fear the jade tower is too high 
And too cold. 
……
There should be no hate; why must we part when the moon is full? 
Parting when it is full~ 
People experience joy and sorrow, separation and reunion; 
The moon has its phases of brightness and dimness, 
Such matters have always been hard to come by. 
I only wish for longevity; may we share the beauty of the moon, even thousands of miles apart."

Once the song concluded, a subtitle appeared, revealing that the song was titled "May We All Live Long."

"That was so beautiful! So melodious! I really want to go back to China!" Wu Xiaomei exclaimed, overwhelmed by emotions. She had never experienced such a wonderful feeling from any video before!

Determined, Wu Xiaomei decided that after graduating from university, she would return to China to develop her career! She would reclaim her nationality and savor the delicious meat-filled mooncakes!

On YouTube, the video’s view count wasn’t astronomical, but it was steadily increasing. However, in China, the video was skyrocketing in views across various platforms, showing signs of going viral.

In the Douyin comments section, the reactions poured in:

"That was stunning! I can't believe someone could turn the lyrics of 'Shui Diao Ge Tou' into such a beautiful song! The national style is rising!"

"Xingchen Entertainment is too impressive! The girls from Beidou are absolutely gorgeous!"

"What girls? They are the Seven Fairies!"

"The fairy sisters are amazing! I want to be a fan of yours!"

"I followed them yesterday! You people are so slow!"

"Hurry up and release the audio version; I want to loop it over and over!"

"Where was this video filmed? The scenery is incredible!"

"I was planning to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival alone, but seeing this beautiful video suddenly made me feel less lonely."

"Did no one notice the meat-filled mooncakes? I've never had one, and I really want to try!"

"My shopping cart is already filled with meat-filled mooncakes; I’ll be able to eat them in two days! Slurp!"

"Ah! I want to buy them too!"

"Meat-filled mooncakes? I can't even imagine. Aren't mooncakes supposed to be sweet?"

"I’ve had both sweet and savory; they’re both delicious. This topic isn’t as controversial as the sweet vs. savory tofu pudding debate—I declare it a tie!"

"I’ve heard there are ham mooncakes. Are they good?"

"Ham sausage mooncakes? Isn’t that a dark culinary dish?"

"No, it’s smoked ham made from pig legs! This kind of mooncake is super tasty; I, a Northerner, love it!"

"Everyone’s welcome to Yunnan Province to try ham mooncakes; they are really delicious~"
