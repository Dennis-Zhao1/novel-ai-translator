**Insurance**

The livestream host known as "An Ning Mama" is actually named Huang Xiufen. 

Three years ago, her husband passed away due to illness, leaving her and her mother-in-law to care for a pair of twin children. Unfortunately, just at the beginning of this year, both of her twins were diagnosed with uremia! Their father had died from uremia, and Huang Xiufen could never have imagined that her children would suffer from the same condition. 

Huang Xiufen's family lives in a small county town in Anhui Province. They aren't wealthy but manage to get by, living at a level typical of ordinary citizens. Initially, to pay for her husband’s uremia treatment, they drained their savings and borrowed a considerable amount of money from friends and relatives. Sadly, when her husband was diagnosed, it was already at an advanced stage, and before they could gather enough funds for a kidney transplant, he succumbed to heart failure in the hospital.

After her husband’s death, Huang Xiufen repaid the money borrowed for the kidney treatment to her friends and family. Who would have thought that three years later, she would have to ask them for money again, and this time, the amount would be even greater than before? Some relatives who had lent her money last time refused to help again, while others still extended a hand, offering loans. But the funds were far from sufficient, only enough to temporarily cover the children's hospitalization and dialysis costs.

To find kidney sources for her two children and get them the necessary surgeries, Huang Xiufen needed much more money. She had applied for the Water Droplet Fund, but the world is filled with people facing similar hardships—countless individuals apply for funding every day. In the end, her application only raised 10,000 yuan, and once the 30-day period ended, the fundraising channel automatically closed.

Just when Huang Xiufen was at her wit's end, overwhelmed with the stress of her children's medical expenses, a relative suggested she start a livestream on Douyin, noting that many people in need had received help from the public through livestreaming. Without hesitation, Huang Xiufen opened a livestream on Douyin.

Unfortunately, she still couldn’t raise enough money for the treatment through the livestream. After three months of broadcasting, she had only received a little over 3,000 yuan in donations. This amount came directly from viewers who contributed through the donation link she had set up during her livestreams. The audience watching Huang Xiufen's streams were everyday people, each burdened with their own financial pressures, typically donating only 5, 10, or 20 yuan to express their support, with a few even giving 50 or 100 yuan. Since these were not tips, they didn't count as livestream earnings.

During the streams, Huang Xiufen received a few gifts, but they were only worth 1 Douyin coin each—a mere 10 cents in cash. After splitting that with the Douyin platform, she ultimately earned just 30 cents from the livestream. With her daughter’s health deteriorating, Huang Xiufen felt a bitter pang in her mouth, but she was determined not to let her viewers see her despair.

She noted that successful streamers who had received social assistance always maintained a positive attitude, spreading hope and encouragement rather than negativity. She resolved to learn from them. Even though she had to work night shifts and care for her children during the day alongside her mother-in-law, she forced herself to keep a smile on her face.

At that moment, Huang Xiufen noticed a comment in the livestream asking how much the total treatment cost would be for her twins. Before she could respond, another comment popped up, berating her.

"What are you asking that for? Do you want to help them? If parents had any sense, they would have bought insurance for their kids when they were born! Now that something’s happened, you want people to donate money? The situation your family is in is your own responsibility!"

Huang Xiufen felt a mix of anger and helplessness as she read the comment from a user named "Shige." This person repeatedly criticized her on the livestream, accusing her of lacking safety awareness and pushing insurance, claiming that her family's misfortune was due to their negligence. Huang Xiufen had cried over "Shige's" comments twice, feeling wronged; if they had the money, they would have certainly bought insurance for their children.

Her family was covered by the national basic health insurance but had not purchased any additional disease insurance from private companies, as those plans typically cost around 10,000 yuan per person per year. For a family earning less than 40,000 yuan annually, how could they afford that?

Their current health insurance could reimburse outpatient and hospitalization costs, but it did not cover kidney source fees, and the reimbursement for surgery was minimal. After the operation, they would also need to pay for post-operative monitoring. But Huang Xiufen couldn't even scrape together the kidney source and surgery fees, let alone think about subsequent expenses.

Although there weren't many viewers in her livestream, most of them couldn't stand "Shige's" comments and started defending Huang Xiufen.

"I think if you can help, do it! If you can't, then don’t kick someone when they’re down! This family has suffered enough! Bringing up insurance at this point is ridiculous; how many people around you have actually bought insurance?"

"Does buying insurance prevent illness? Both kids have uremia; what good will insurance do?"

"Some people are just trying to get by; buying insurance is a luxury they can’t afford."

"Everyone's trying their best, and you’re here throwing salt on their wounds! Your actions only tarnish the insurance company's reputation!"

"Shige" replied, "Accidents come unexpectedly, and major illnesses can strike at any time. It's a high probability that people will face serious health issues in their lifetime. Aging, sickness, and death are natural human processes, but many face them prematurely. You folks don’t understand the importance of being prepared for the worst; I suggest you check out my video on ‘Why People Should Buy Insurance’."

"I think it’s better to consider buying insurance only when life is stable. Everyone has different thoughts; don’t impose your views on others."

"You’re so funny! With insurance costing over 10,000 a year, who in rural areas or small towns is even thinking about that? How many people pay and then cancel? If you can’t help, don’t harm others! No one expects a family member to fall ill!"

“Seriously, not all insurance is good! The industry is riddled with traps! A friend bought a policy for nearly 20,000 a year, but after looking into it, he found that if he ever got sick, a lot wouldn’t even be reimbursed! Insurance companies have their own agenda, and they always come out on top!”

"Get out of here! Don’t sell insurance in someone else's livestream!"

"Let’s be kind here! The fact is, someone is already sick. If you can’t help them, don’t criticize them, and don’t disrupt the livestream! An Ning Mama would rather not receive donations than have her kids be unhealthy!"

"Shige" replied again, "I’m a straightforward guy, and I speak plainly. My goal is to remind everyone with elderly and young ones to prepare for the worst because you never know when disaster will strike. Don’t wait until something happens to beg for help from society; I’m not a miracle worker!"

"I’m a straightforward guy, and I speak plainly. Ugh! You’ve twisted the meaning of being straightforward!"

"Shige" shot back, "If you didn’t comment, no one would think you couldn’t type!"

Stella Ling, watching these comments, felt a headache coming on. Why was no one responding to her question?  

While she believed that within one's means, insurance was indeed necessary, she found "Shige's" behavior—poking at others' wounds—very irritating. She decided to block the insurance company he was promoting. 

Who promotes insurance like this?

“An Ning Mama, don’t worry about other comments for now; just tell me how much you need for all the treatments combined.”

“The kidney source fee here is about 200,000 yuan…”

Before she could finish, "Shige" jumped in again, “What are you asking that for? Want to be a fool? Let me tell you, the total treatment cost for these two kids is at least 600,000 yuan! Add in hospitalization and post-operative monitoring, and that’s another 200,000 yuan! Stunned, are we? It’s not easy to find a fool! Now do you see the necessity of insurance?”

Stella Ling rolled her eyes at "Shige's" comment on her screen. 

Now she finally understood how much "An Ning Mama" needed. A minimum of 800,000 yuan; she’d add another 200,000 yuan to make it a million. 

After checking the Douyin platform's gift-sharing rules, Stella realized that the platform shared gifts with hosts at a 50-50 split. That meant she would need to donate gifts worth 2 million yuan in total. 

The most expensive gift in the livestream gift shop was the Carnival, costing 30,000 Douyin coins, which was equivalent to 3,000 yuan. 

Stella calculated that to donate 2 million yuan, she would need to send 667 Carnivals.

Huang Xiufen was deeply pained by "Shige's" comments and wanted to block him but hesitated. She remembered having blocked him before, only for him to return with a new account, leaving even ruder comments that incited the wrath of the other viewers and turned the entire livestream atmosphere chaotic.

Just as Huang Xiufen was feeling conflicted, a massive, colorful effect suddenly erupted on her screen, startling her.

What was that?

Huang Xiufen stared at the screen in shock, and in the next second, the effect appeared again, repeating a total of 15 times.

“Wow! An Ning Mama has found a benefactor! That’s a Carnival! The most expensive gift in the livestream!”

“Fifteen in a row! That’s 45,000 yuan! What a generous contribution!”

“Am I the only one who thinks it’s a bit of a waste? Why not just donate directly to the fundraising channel? This way, only half of it goes to ‘An Ning Mama’.”
