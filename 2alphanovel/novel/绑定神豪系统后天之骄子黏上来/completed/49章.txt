**Building with Money**

She wasn't some gang collecting protection fees from door to door. Why was Mr. Peng acting this way?

Stella Ling felt confused. Mr. Peng was a friend of Manager Liu; could it be that Liu had said something to him that led to such a strange act of giving money away?

With that thought in mind, Stella stopped and turned to Liu Dengfeng, her expression grateful. "Manager Liu, I really appreciate your help this time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even know where to purchase such a great custom car. Let me treat you to a meal."

"Miss Ling, you’re too polite. As an owner of our property center, serving you is my duty," Liu Dengfeng quickly replied with a smile.

"No need for us to be so formal. Come on, Manager Liu, there are some things I’d like to discuss with you," Stella said.

"Sure, it’s my honor. Thank you for the invitation, Miss Ling," Liu Dengfeng responded, smiling, but he was also pondering what Stella wanted to talk about.

"Of course." 

After Stella replied, she walked to the roadside, intending to hail a taxi, but Liu Dengfeng stopped her, saying, "Miss Ling, why not take my car? It’s parked at the International Financial Building, not far from here."

"Alright," Stella nodded.

Half an hour later, the two arrived at a private dining restaurant that Stella had found on a review website.

The restaurant had a courtyard-style décor. It was Stella's first time here and she hadn’t made a reservation, but since there were private rooms available, she booked one for the convenience of their conversation.

Glancing at the menu, Stella ordered one of everything from the restaurant’s signature dishes, then passed the menu to Liu Dengfeng for him to choose what he liked.

"That's enough, we won't finish all this," Manager Liu laughed, trying to decline.

Dishes included precious yellow flower fish, splendid lobsters, East China sea cucumbers, New Zealand black gold abalone, exquisite flower snails, heavenly ducks, summer truffle chicken, braised beef head, osmanthus deer tendons, and pocket tofu.

In total, ten dishes were ordered, plus some desserts for after the meal, more than enough for the two of them.

"Great." 

Stella nodded, then turned to the waiter recording their order. "Let’s go with these dishes, and please make another portion of the ones I just ordered. I’ll take that to go when we leave."

"Sure," the waiter quickly noted.

Liu Dengfeng was taken aback. He recalled Stella had mentioned she came to Chengdu alone; was that extra portion her late-night snack?

Well, she certainly had quite the appetite.

As Stella sipped her tea, she mused to herself about how exhausting it was to communicate with these executives and managers; they were never straightforward about their intentions.

After a moment of contemplation, eager not to owe anyone any favors, Stella decided to cut to the chase.

"Manager Liu, I actually prefer a straightforward way of communicating. I don’t like beating around the bush. Is Mr. Peng looking for my help with something?" 

Stella absentmindedly scratched her forehead with the index finger adorned with a Serpent Bohème rose garnet ring, looking inquiringly at Liu Dengfeng.

"Uh? How should I put this?" Liu Dengfeng was momentarily stunned; did old Peng ask Miss Ling for help without his knowledge?

He had been at the Tengfei 4S store the whole time with Stella and hadn’t paid attention to what Mr. Peng was doing...

Seeing Liu Dengfeng genuinely appeared confused, Stella had no choice but to clarify what Mr. Peng had done: "I bought a Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge for 7 million, but the actual price is 9.5 million. Mr. Peng sold it to me for 2.5 million less."

"I find Mr. Peng’s behavior a bit hard to understand. If he needs something from me, he could just say so. I like things to be mutually beneficial; I don’t enjoy being in debt to others. Giving someone money without explanation is really puzzling." 

Liu Dengfeng fell silent for a moment. If Stella was confused, so was he.

Old Peng, the stingy guy, was actually willing to part with so much cash!

He had helped Mr. Peng so many times, yet the man had never treated him to a meal costing over 300 yuan! It was always hotpot or skewers!

He was nothing like Miss Ling, who treated people to abalone and lobster without a second thought!

If it weren’t for their old school ties, he would have cut ties with that stingy guy a long time ago!

"Miss Ling, this matter is also puzzling for me. Give me some time to ask him," Liu Dengfeng said, pulling out his phone.

"Alright," Stella nodded.

According to Caishen, when Mr. Peng had to dig into his own pockets, he was almost in tears.

If he needed her help with something, she would assist if she could, and if not, she could just pay him back that 2.5 million.

After all, she was someone with extraordinary luck, and money came easily to her; others had to earn it through hard work.

Liu Dengfeng quickly typed and sent a WeChat message to Peng Lide: "Old Peng, what’s gotten into you? Does Miss Ling need that 2.5 million? She’s asking me directly if you need her help!"

The response came quickly: "Did Miss Ling notice there’s an issue with the car price? How does she know?"

Liu Dengfeng wanted to roll his eyes at the reply and continued texting: "She’s no ordinary person; of course, she has access to such information!"

"Old Peng, are you stupid? If you really need something from her, you should have mentioned the car price up front and then given her a 2.5 million discount, rather than sneaking around. It’s no wonder Miss Ling is puzzled; I’m confused too!"

The response from Peng Lide was: "I just realized how silly I was!"

"Maybe it’s because I was too nervous dealing with someone of such a high background for the first time; my brain just short-circuited."

Liu Dengfeng felt exasperated and shot back: "Stop wasting my time! Miss Ling doesn’t like beating around the bush. If you want something from her, just say it! Does she really need that little money?"

The wait for a reply was a bit long, and by the time the dishes arrived, a long message finally came through.

After learning of what Peng Lide wanted, Liu Dengfeng couldn’t help but frown deeply.

What the heck!

He thought a mere 2.5 million could convince Miss Ling to take over his mess?

What a pipe dream!

Seeing Liu Dengfeng’s troubled expression, Stella couldn’t help but ask, "What’s wrong?"

"It’s nothing. Old Peng just miscalculated," Liu Dengfeng hesitated for a few seconds before answering. "Miss Ling, let’s eat."

"Really?" Stella asked for confirmation, then continued, "Manager Liu, I already mentioned I don’t like guessing. If Mr. Peng doesn’t need my help, tell him to send me his bank account so I can pay him back that 2.5 million."

Stella didn’t want to owe anyone anything for no reason.

She wasn’t foolish; she understood that Mr. Peng’s actions were meant to convey a sense of closeness and willingness to build a relationship with her.

Gift-giving primarily serves to establish emotional connections through relationships, which can then be leveraged to achieve goals.

Once Star Entertainment was officially established, Stella knew she would certainly encounter such situations again.

In this society, many things often relied on connections.

If one didn’t have connections, they needed to create them.

Stella didn’t mind establishing a relationship with Peng Lide; in case Caishen sent her tasks with too much funding in the future, she could rely on that relationship to resolve matters swiftly at his 4S store.

Moreover, to maintain this relationship, Peng Lide would surely recommend high-quality luxury cars to her, ensuring she wouldn’t be served inferior products.

"Miss Ling, I’ll be honest then." 

After hearing Stella’s words, Liu Dengfeng paused for a few seconds before relaying Peng Lide’s request in detail.

It turned out that Peng Lide owned an A-level 4S store in the high-tech zone of Chengdu, covering an area of 5,000 square meters.

However, this store had been losing money since opening, and despite trying numerous methods, he couldn’t revive it. After four years, it had incurred losses for four consecutive years.

This 4S store was the largest one Peng Lide had, and without considering the land leasing costs, he had invested 30 million yuan.

Initially, he aimed to make it strong and successful, confident enough to lease the land for ten years.

Who would have thought that after the store was built, it would be the one suffering the most losses among the six 4S stores, consistently leading in losses year after year.

Peng Lide had planned to close this store last year and lease the land to someone else.

Unfortunately, the area was too large, and he had asked everyone he could think of, including his friend Liu Dengfeng, who had connections with Longhua Comprehensive Development Company, but no one was interested in leasing the land.

"So, the land has six years left on its lease? Does Mr. Peng want me to take over that piece of land?" Stella asked.

"To be precise, there are still five and a half years left. Initially, it took half a year just for renovations," Liu Dengfeng replied, then added sheepishly, "It’s not necessarily about you taking over. You could also see if any of your friends are interested in that land. If not, don’t worry; Old Peng is just putting pressure on you."

Stella didn’t feel troubled at all since a new idea was forming in her mind, so she continued, "Manager Liu, could you describe the geographical location of that land in detail? What buildings are nearby?"

"That land is in Chengdu’s high-tech zone, on the outskirts, with convenient transportation, close to the airport. There’s also an automotive trade market nearby and a well-established public engineering system."

As Liu Dengfeng spoke, he used his phone’s map to circle the location of the 4S store Mr. Peng was eager to offload.

"See? It’s right here. And look, there’s an automotive trade city not far from the store. Logically speaking, the geographical conditions are quite good; I don’t understand why it keeps losing money." 

Stella glanced at Liu Dengfeng’s phone, and the location did indeed seem good; there was even a high-speed rail station nearby.

From her perspective as an outsider, it seemed the reason Mr. Peng’s 4S store was continually losing money had little to do with its location.

Perhaps it was due to the slowing growth of Chengdu’s automotive market and market saturation.

Chengdu had no restrictions on car purchases; having flown to Chengdu twice, Stella had always passed by numerous 4S stores on her way out of the airport, even more than those she passed in the capital city.

This underscored the fierce competition among 4S stores in Chengdu.

After pondering for a while, Stella turned to Liu Dengfeng and asked, "Manager Liu, how much is the annual leasing fee for that land?"

Liu Dengfeng calculated briefly and replied, "Around 2.43 million."

With five and a half years remaining on the lease, Stella calculated that it would roughly cost 13.365 million.

Stella then asked, "Manager Liu, if I wanted to convert that land into an indoor sports complex, how much would the renovation cost?"

Liu Dengfeng’s eyes widened in surprise, quickly asking, "Miss Ling, are you planning to take over that land? And build an indoor sports complex?"

"I’m still considering it. I need to know the renovation costs before deciding whether to take over," Stella replied with a smile.

"Well, to demolish the 4S store and rebuild would require at least 5 million," Liu Dengfeng thought for a moment before answering.

Upon hearing the price, Stella immediately responded, "Oh, that’s not too bad."

Liu Dengfeng was at a loss for words. 

"If you want to create a luxurious indoor sports complex, it might cost even more—1 million, 1.5 million for renovations," Liu Dengfeng added.

Stella nodded, "That works."

Liu Dengfeng was left speechless.

What else could he say? This was the world of the wealthy.

Stella kept a casual appearance, but inside, she was communicating with Caishen: "Caishen A Dream, I’m about to draw a lottery, so you better come through for me!"

**[It’s on me!]**

Having completed random and weekly tasks today, Stella hadn’t drawn a lottery yet.

Now, with a potential expenditure of nearly 30 million, she absolutely needed to hit the jackpot because aside from the company’s 10 million registered capital, she only had over 30 million left in her bank account!

I’m drawing!

The pointer spun wildly, finally landing on the random skills reward section.

**[Congratulations, Little Star! You’ve gained the skill of a seasoned driver!]**

Great, she had just bought a car and now didn’t need to learn how to drive!

But that wasn’t what she wanted!

I’ll draw again!

The pointer spun again, eventually stopping in the physical rewards section.

**[5 minutes of use for the American Express Black Card!]**

Stella slapped her thigh in excitement and said to Liu Dengfeng, "Manager Liu, I’m going to take that piece of land! Please call Mr. Peng over now to sign the contract. I also want to sign a renovation agreement with you. I remember your property center is under Longhua Comprehensive Development Company, so you should know a company that can handle the luxurious indoor sports complex renovation. I want to sign a renovation contract for over 30 million today."

Over 30 million! 

How luxurious do you want it to be?

Liu Dengfeng was stunned, realizing it only took him a moment to react. He quickly called Peng Lide to come over with the contract, then made another call to the owner of a decorating company capable of handling luxurious indoor sports complexes, saying there was a 30 million deal ready to be signed today.

Stella was very pleased with Liu Dengfeng's quick response; she needed to sign both contracts today, or her Black Card might be refreshed by a random task that appeared tomorrow.

The purpose of acquiring that piece of land wasn’t to open a luxurious indoor sports complex.

Wasn’t it said that there weren’t enough performance stages in the entertainment industry?

So why not build one herself?

A stage dedicated solely for her artists to use!
