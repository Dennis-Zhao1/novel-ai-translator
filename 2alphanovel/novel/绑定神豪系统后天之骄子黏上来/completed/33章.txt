**The Elegance of a Rich Girl**

"I—I don’t believe it!" 

Wang Lingling shouted defiantly, but her demeanor had shifted significantly from earlier. Even if the two male colleagues who had been holding her arms let go, she wouldn’t pounce like a rabid dog to bite anyone anymore.

"Enough!" 

A furious voice rang out.

Turning towards the source, Stella Ling saw Zhang Aiyue, who had unexpectedly stepped out of her office, her face etched with anger as she glared at Wang Lingling.

"Wang Lingling, do you think this company is your home?" 

"I can’t even be bothered to mention your work attitude. If we weren’t from the same school, I truly wouldn’t want a subordinate who loves to stir up trouble and quarrel! I'm giving you two choices: either go home and reflect for a while, and come back on the 16th of this month, or pack your things and get out of here!"

Zhang Aiyue pointed vigorously at the door as she shouted at Wang Lingling.

"Senior!" 

Wang Lingling grumbled in discontent. Why was she being singled out when Stella had also argued? Did the senior fear Stella’s true identity and pick on her because she was the easier target?

Seeing that Wang Lingling still had the audacity to protest, Zhang Aiyue, already burning with frustration, fixed her gaze on Wang Lingling and reiterated each word with precision, "Either go home and reflect or pack your things and leave. Which one do you choose?"

Wang Lingling bit her trembling lip, unwilling to respond.

"Choose quickly!" Zhang Aiyue barked.

Her patience was wearing thin; if Wang Lingling continued to drag things out, she’d fire her on the spot!

It was one thing to lose face at last night’s dinner—after all, the private room was filled with senior management from their various departments, and they wouldn't pass the word down to the subordinates. But to see Wang Lingling causing a scene today was unacceptable!

"I'll go home and reflect."

Startled by the raised voice, Wang Lingling quickly replied.

With a reluctant demeanor, she returned to her workstation, wiping her tears as she stuffed her phone and makeup mirror into her bag.

As soon as Wang Lingling left the company, Zhang Aiyue turned to the onlookers still lingering around and scolded, "Haven't you seen enough excitement? Get back to work!"

The crowd dispersed like startled birds.

"Xiaoxing, come to my office."

Stella Ling, who had been heading back to her workstation, was called by her senior.

Once inside the office, Zhang Aiyue had just settled into her chair when Stella Ling lowered her head and confessed, "Senior, I was just fooling Wang Lingling earlier. I’m not close to Li Qizhen at all; we hardly know each other."

"I just dislike Wang Lingling and wanted to provoke her, to scare her."

Zhang Aiyue burst into laughter, "I know, only someone like her would believe that!"

The senior's laughter eased Stella Ling’s tension.

Zhang Aiyue had been chuckling, but Stella Ling’s next words left her speechless.

"But I really have come into money, so I don’t want to be a wage worker anymore."

Stella Ling explained, feeling that as long as she remained a worker, she might still encounter colleagues like Wang Lingling. Especially now that she carried the powerful fortune with its side effects, she worried that if one day a colleague witnessed her being pursued by one of Heaven’s Chosen Ones, there would be gossip behind her back—worse, someone like Wang Lingling, driven mad by jealousy, might come looking for trouble.

Thus, after resigning, she had no desire to seek out a new translation job.

Stella Ling didn’t want to be a wage worker anymore; she wanted to be a boss!

Even if subordinates envied their boss's popularity, they likely wouldn’t express it openly. If any foolish subordinate dared to act like Wang Lingling, she would directly fire them!

Being a boss was exhilarating!

Zhang Aiyue, still in disbelief, asked, "Huh? So you’re not planning to look for a new translation job?"

"Mm," Stella Ling nodded.

Zhang Aiyue couldn't help but advise, "Xiaoxing, living off past earnings is not wise. Even if you have money, you should stay engaged with society. What if something unexpected happens one day and that money isn't enough?"

After hearing her senior's words, Stella Ling smiled, "Senior, I inherited a considerable inheritance from my relatives. While I’m not working anymore, I can become a boss!"

"If I open a large company one day and need to hire people, you must come work for me. I promise to offer you a salary higher than what you earn here!"

Upon hearing Stella Ling's recruitment pitch, Zhang Aiyue was even more astonished.

Zhang Aiyue currently earned around twenty thousand a month. For Stella Ling to offer a higher salary? 

Moreover, starting a company wouldn’t involve just hiring one person, right? If she were to establish a company in the capital, the rent alone would be substantial. 

Zhang Aiyue’s own company spent nearly two hundred thousand a month on rent, and it sounded like Stella Ling was planning something larger than "Bai Xue," making her even more curious about the scale of the inheritance Stella had received.

But curiosity aside, total assets were a private matter; unless the individual was willing to share, outsiders shouldn’t pry. It was simply disrespectful.

Zhang Aiyue didn’t press further but instead smiled and said, “Wow, I’ve just gained a valuable connection!”

"Then it’s settled! When Xiaoxing opens her new company, you must spend a fortune to poach me over there; I’ll be waiting for you!" 

Stella Ling beamed back, "Of course."

Zhang Aiyue had called Stella Ling to her office not for any specific reason but because she was worried that if Stella returned to her workstation now, it might feel awkward. 

After all, the harsh words Stella had thrown at Wang Lingling earlier, upon closer reflection, were clearly a bluff. How well could a socialite pretend to be poor, succeeding too well at it, appearing just like an ordinary person? Who would believe that?

The subordinates outside were likely spreading rumors about Stella.

However, Zhang Aiyue believed that Stella had indeed inherited a fortune. 

Stella truly regarded her as someone close; not only was she unafraid of borrowing money, but she also spoke of her inheritance openly and even mentioned hiring her with high wages if she ever opened a big company.

She felt that her care for this junior had not been in vain. 

But she had also cared for Wang Lingling, and that girl was such a handful—absolutely no peace of mind!

Stella Ling stayed in Zhang Aiyue’s office for about half an hour. 

When her colleagues saw her exit without tears, they were curious about what the two had discussed inside.

A female colleague glanced at the busy Stella Ling’s back and leaned closer to another female colleague, whispering, "Hey, do you think what Stella Ling just said is true? Is she really a rich girl?"

The other female colleague rolled her eyes, scoffing, "You believe that? Stella Ling said that to provoke Wang Lingling, only someone like Wang Lingling would fall for it."

"Are you insulting me?"

"How could I? … Wait, you really believed it! Stella Ling doesn’t have the aura of a rich girl at all!"

"Keep your voice down! Ahem, what aura does a rich girl have?"

"Naturally, it's an air of nobility! Some rich girls might not be conventionally beautiful, but their skin is always fair and smooth. Stella Ling is pale but looks like she lacks vitality—her skin doesn’t look smooth either. Most importantly, her hair, while voluminous, is thin and yellow, clearly a sign of poor nutrition. Real heiresses have thick, dark, and shiny hair! If someone has good skin and hair, they just exude an air of elegance. Moreover, the truly rich girls possess a sense of innocence."

"Stella Ling is quite innocent too. Wang Lingling bullies her all the time, and she never retaliates. She’s always cordial. If it weren’t for Wang Lingling going too far this time, I doubt Stella Ling would have said those things."

"Oh, I’m not talking about her personality! The innocence I’m referring to is that carefree quality that comes from a life of abundance, as if they’ve never faced hardships or troubles. Do you understand?"

"I get it now. I think Xiao Yiyao has that kind of aura you’re talking about. I heard her family is wealthy; her fans say she’s a true rich girl, a white and rich beauty."

"Please! She’s no rich girl! That’s just what her fans say! Did you see how she fought over brand endorsements? Does a real heiress act like that over a mere endorsement fee? It’s all a facade! Besides, don’t you feel there’s a hint of scheming behind her eyes?"

"I don’t see it that way. Isn’t Xiao Yiyao really a rich girl?"

"Of course not! Let me tell you…"

The two’s conversation successfully veered off-topic, and Stella Ling, sitting not far away, let out a sigh of relief.

Sometimes, she truly hated her sharp hearing.

After all, her lie had too many loopholes, and essentially no one believed her.

But it was meant just for Wang Lingling to hear; whether others believed it or not didn’t matter.

After work, Stella Ling took a taxi to a nearby beauty salon.

Don’t get it wrong; she wasn’t feeling self-conscious from the comments of her two colleagues, wanting to undergo beauty treatments to transform into a white and rich beauty.

Instead, she had previously bought two pairs of earrings and hadn’t been able to wear them, so she was going to the salon to get her ears pierced.

Twenty minutes later, Stella Ling got out of the car and raised her eyes to the super luxurious beauty salon before her.

She had asked the driver to take her to any beauty salon, not expecting him to bring her to such a high-end place.

Before leaving, the driver smiled at Stella Ling, saying, "Miss, I’ve brought celebrity clients here before, so I think this beauty salon will meet your needs. Celebrities have been here!"

"Uh, that sounds nice. Thank you."

Stella Ling thanked the driver and then walked into the beauty salon frequented by stars.

Once inside, a female staff member approached her with a smile, inquiring about the service she needed.

"Can you do ear piercings here?" Stella Ling asked.

"Yes, we can! Would you like any other services?" the staff member continued to ask.

"Just the ear piercing," Stella Ling replied.

"Alright, please follow me this way."

Stella Ling followed the staff member into a clean, comfortable room, where a masked female worker was waiting.

After sitting in the chair arranged by the masked worker, Stella Ling began to choose the earrings for her piercings.

There were only two materials for the earrings: platinum and pure silver.

Stella Ling noticed that the earrings were quite small and came in various designs, with the platinum earrings priced around 1000 yuan, while the pure silver ones were 200 yuan.

In the end, Stella Ling opted to use her own star-shaped diamond platinum earrings, leaving the beauty salon without making a sale on their earrings.
