Chapter 1: Fortuitous Encounters

Stella Ling took a deep breath as she glanced back at the two men who looked like they were ready to throw down. The tension between them crackled in the air like static electricity. She made a split-second decision to avoid confrontation and hurried back to her new rented apartment. Clutching her crossbody bag tightly to shield her face, she dashed toward the school gate, her heart racing with uncertainty.

“System, are Li Qicheng and Lu Mingxu really Heaven’s Chosen Ones? Are they approaching me because of the side effects of the Celestial Fortune System?” she thought, her mind swirling with questions.

【...Yes, but it’s not entirely that simple.】The system replied, its tone hesitant.

“What do you mean, not entirely?!” Stella’s frustration mounted as she ran, her mind racing.

By the time she reached her apartment, she was still grappling with the system's cryptic response. Sitting on the couch in her living room, she found the little cat-like system creature perched on the coffee table, its big eyes blinking expectantly as if waiting for her to voice her concerns.

“So, you’re saying both Li Qicheng and Lu Mingxu are classified as Heaven’s Chosen Ones?” Stella asked, still in disbelief. “Are they genuinely pursuing me? They’re not just playing games with me, right?”

“Mmhm!” the little cat nodded seriously.

Stella’s heart sank as she recalled the surveillance footage that had circulated on Douyin, connecting the dots between her and Li Qicheng. Had he actually been stalking her like Lu Mingxu? The thought sent chills down her spine, shattering her previous admiration for Li Qicheng.

“Let’s forget about Li Qicheng for now, but are you sure Lu Mingxu is a Heaven’s Chosen One?” Stella couldn’t help but scoff. “He seems more like a criminal than a chosen one.”

The little cat nodded vigorously, clearly agreeing with her assessment. It also didn’t think Lu Mingxu was a suitable example of a Heaven’s Chosen One.

Stella’s mind drifted back to the disturbing memories from the “Scenery” KTV. She shivered at the thought of being entangled with someone like Lu Mingxu. However, it seemed that Lu Mingxu’s obsession with her was somehow linked to the system’s side effects, making her the unwitting culprit in this bizarre scenario…

With a heavy sigh, Stella sank deeper into the couch, feeling exasperated. After half an hour of contemplation, she made a resolute decision. “System, let’s unbind. You can take back all my money.”

The system’s side effects felt as terrifying to Stella as an ancient curse. It was absurd that normal individuals, under some inexplicable power, would suddenly pursue strangers. With her moral compass, Stella could never allow something like that to happen to her, even if she stood to gain from it.

She shuddered at the thought of being irresistibly drawn to a stranger, like some sort of obsessed stalker. It was a nightmare scenario!

“Unfortunately, once the system is bound, it cannot be unbound,” the little cat said, shaking its head with a solemn expression.

“Then why did you bind me without even asking? And to give me such side effects? That feels terribly unfair!” Stella retorted, feeling particularly aggrieved now that she knew she couldn’t just unbind from the system.

Upon hearing this, the little cat’s eyes welled up with tears, and it jumped into Stella’s lap. “Do you dislike me now, Stella?” it asked, its voice trembling.

Stella’s heart softened as she wiped away the tears from its cheeks. “I don’t dislike you. I just don’t like the side effects of being pursued by Heaven’s Chosen Ones.”

Although Stella had known the little system creature for just a week, she had already come to regard it as family. After losing her own family, she had lived in solitude for far too long, and meeting the system had brightened her days. The generous financial support made her happy, but it was the assistance at “Scenery” KTV that she truly appreciated.

The system always found ways to help her achieve her goals and rewards, and with all its support, how could she ever dislike it? But the idea of a side effect that made others infatuated with her felt utterly repulsive.

“Stella, the truth is, being pursued by Heaven’s Chosen Ones isn’t entirely a side effect of the system,” the little cat said, its mood lifting now that it knew Stella didn’t hate it.

“I bound you not just because you had a strong desire for money,” it continued. “There are plenty of people with a strong desire for wealth. The reason I chose you is that you possess strong luck!”

“Strong luck? What does that mean?” Stella asked, puzzled.

The little cat explained, “Strong luck refers to someone with an exceptional aura of fortune and a high luck value. You’re that kind of person, which is why I bound you!”

“That’s impossible!” Stella exclaimed, unable to accept the idea. “If I really had strong luck, then why did my family pass away so early, leaving me all alone? And why have I lived in poverty before binding with you?”

The logic simply didn’t hold!

But the system persisted in its explanation. “Your strong luck will begin to manifest when you turn 23. By next year, during your zodiac year, your fortune will peak and become unstoppable!”

“Li Qicheng and Lu Mingxu are Heaven’s Chosen Ones, favored by fortune, and they pursue luck.”

“But you are a Heaven’s Chosen Woman with luck thousands of times stronger than theirs, possessing a fortune that can encompass the entire world!”

“You are like luck itself, naturally attracting the attention of Heaven’s Chosen Ones.”

“Ordinary people cannot withstand the binding of the Celestial Fortune System because they lack the virtue to match their position. A forced binding could lead to death. Only those with strong luck can survive the binding and handle such a massive blessing.”

“I didn’t tell you before because I was afraid you wouldn’t accept this explanation and think I was lying, refusing to bind with me.”

“Even without binding me, your strong luck would have attracted Li Qicheng and Lu Mingxu because of the aura you carry.”

“I’m not lying!” The little cat assured her, its chest puffed with pride.

Stella was left speechless, realizing that she was someone exceptional, which was why the Celestial Fortune System had chosen to bind with her. 

“Then why did you initially say that being pursued by Heaven’s Chosen Ones was a side effect of the system?” she asked, still confused.

The little cat scratched its head, looking puzzled. “Isn’t it what most girls dream of? I thought if I framed it as a side effect, you’d be happy and like me even more.”

Stella blinked, momentarily lost for words.

The system had a point. She had fantasized about an incredibly talented partner during her younger years. But that had merely been a girlish dream.

In reality, if an extraordinary man genuinely pursued her, after the initial excitement faded, Stella would rationally question his motives. She’d wonder what he wanted from her. Perhaps an unknown relative had left her a fortune, and that was why he was interested?

If not, why would a Heaven’s Chosen One chase a regular woman like her instead of those who were beautiful and accomplished?

Now Stella understood that Li Qicheng and Lu Mingxu were drawn to her because of her strong luck. Rather than pursuing her, they were chasing the luck itself.

Still, she found it hard to believe that someone as ordinary as her could be considered a person of strong luck. The concept was utterly bewildering.

“Is there any way to resolve this situation of being pursued?” she asked the system, genuinely seeking assistance. The last thing she wanted was to be stalked, even if they were Heaven’s Chosen Ones with top-tier looks and backgrounds.

“Hmm, I could add a skill to the system’s lottery that would conceal your luck. If you manage to draw this skill, using it will prevent Heaven’s Chosen Ones from chasing after you. However, it will be quite difficult to draw,” the little cat explained after some thought.

“Why would it be hard to draw? Am I not a person of strong luck?” Stella inquired, confused.

“And besides, don’t you usually grant me anything I want?” Stella added, her eyes narrowing playfully.

“Cough, cough! I told you not to be so straightforward! If the higher-ups find out, I’ll be penalized!” the little cat coughed awkwardly, trying to cover its embarrassment. “The reason this skill is hard to draw is because you are indeed a person of strong luck!”

“I mentioned earlier that your luck covers the entire world! Just think about how powerful a skill would have to be to conceal such luck? It’s bound to be quite challenging to draw!”

“But don’t worry. As long as the system task completion rate is high, the luck value for drawing will slowly increase, and one day you will draw this skill!” The little cat gave Stella a thumbs-up and winked as if to encourage her.

Stella forced a smile, realizing that until she managed to draw that skill to conceal her aura of luck, she would have to endure the pursuit…

Also, how was it that this high-tech system was suddenly intertwined with the concept of metaphysical luck?

“Isn’t that the case? Metaphysics is just a more advanced form of science! Do you think high-tech realms are devoid of metaphysical concepts?” the little cat replied, crossing its arms with a serious expression.

“As for my realm, I can’t disclose any more details. If I do, I’ll be summoned back by my superior,” it added gravely.

Stella, taken aback by the thought of the little cat being recalled, immediately straightened up. “Okay, I won’t ask anymore! Let’s get some sleep! I’m exhausted after all this.”

The sheer volume of information from tonight was overwhelming, and she hadn’t fully processed it yet. Physically and mentally drained, Stella lay back onto the couch, which was surprisingly spacious enough to accommodate her entire body.

Remembering that she hadn’t brought any change of clothes to her rental, she decided to ask for half a day off from work tomorrow.

Just as she began to doze off, her phone vibrated suddenly, jolting her awake. 

Picking it up, she saw it was a WeChat message from Yang Dan.

“Stella, those two stunning guys almost got into a fight! Luckily, I got the dormitory manager to intervene in time and prevent a bloodbath!” 

Yang Dan had also sent a photo of Li Qicheng and Lu Mingxu standing in front of the dormitory building, both men glaring at each other.

“Stella, who are they exactly? They don’t seem to be students from our school. That handsome guy who came later said he was your friend? Is that true?”

After pondering for a moment, Stella replied, “No, I’m not familiar with either of them. I’m living off-campus from now on, so they probably won’t come back to school to cause trouble.”

“Honestly, it doesn’t matter if they come back or not. If they do, I’ll just treat it as a show to watch. I’m just worried they’ll continue to harass you.” Yang Dan sent a worried emoji in response.
