**Trial**

Upon learning the reason behind it, Stella Ling nearly tripped over her own feet. 

Well, she certainly didn’t expect this to be the cause.

Stella made her way to the nearby street of her neighborhood and hailed a taxi, instructing the driver to take her to the nearest luxury brand store. 

Whether it was jewelry, clothing, or watches, she was open to any upscale shop.

Hearing her request, the driver pressed down on the accelerator, skillfully maneuvering through the streets, finally dropping her off at a neon-lit commercial street bustling with activity.

As Stella stepped out of the taxi, she headed towards the nearest brand clothing store. However, as soon as she entered, she was stopped by a staff member.

“Sorry, miss, but we’re closing. Please try another store,” the female employee said, blocking her path with a polite yet insincere smile.

Stella realized it was a bit late and shrugged it off.

As she left the shop, she brushed past a stylishly dressed woman. Intrigued by the woman's outfit, Stella’s gaze followed her, only to see the woman enter the same store where she had just been turned away. To her surprise, the same employee who had barred her from entering was now eagerly attending to the newcomer, showcasing a dress with a radiant smile.

Is she the store owner coming for an inspection?

Through the glass window, Stella watched as the previously dismissive employee now treated the fashionable woman with utmost respect, displaying the dress with an inviting demeanor.

Glancing at the store's opening hours displayed on a sign by the entrance, Stella couldn't help but confirm her suspicion.

That employee had simply refused to serve her.

What a joke! They don’t want to earn money!

Stella looked up at the brand logo above the entrance and pulled out her phone to search for “Du Jia Bana.”

The first trending information that popped up was about the brand’s offensive stance against China.

Not just that; it seemed to be disrespectful to all Asians worldwide.

Stella felt a wave of relief wash over her, even grateful for the snub. 

Thank goodness they didn’t serve her, or what would her colleagues think if she wore this brand's clothes to work tomorrow? What would Manager Park, a fellow countryman, think?

Determined, Stella walked into another brand store nearby.

This time, it was a brand she had shopped at recently—Scented Grandmother.

Upon entering, she wasn’t met with any resistance. However, all the staff completely ignored her presence. No one approached to assist her, nor did anyone even spare her a glance.

Feeling a bit frustrated, she glanced down at her outfit.

She wore a melon green casual short-sleeve top paired with olive green shorts, which cost nearly a thousand yuan combined.

When she visited the Scented Grandmother store at the Guomao Mall, she was dressed in even cheaper clothes, yet the staff had not treated her this way.

Why was the service so different between stores of the same brand?

If it weren’t for the limited time for her task, Stella would have loved to shop at the Guomao Mall's Scented Grandmother store right now.

With only 13 minutes left to complete her daily task, Stella didn’t want to spend her money in a store with such poor service.

So, she stepped out of the indifferent Scented Grandmother store and entered another clothing shop nearby.

This time, she wasn’t ignored. A neatly dressed female employee, around 35 years old, approached her. With her hands clasped in front of her stomach and a slight bow, she politely inquired, “Hello, miss, welcome to the LV counter. I’m the clothing salesperson, Xiao Wang. How may I assist you?”

“Uh, yes, just a moment,” Stella replied, slightly taken aback as she quickly pulled out her phone to look up the LV brand.

She had definitely heard of this renowned brand, but she needed to confirm its political stance to ensure it wasn’t another Du Jia Bana.

Once she found out that this brand maintained a neutral stance, Stella let out a sigh of relief and pointed to a blue short-sleeve dress nearby. “I want to buy this one.”

Xiao Wang reacted swiftly, retrieving the dress from the mannequin while smiling. “This is the SCULPTURAL short-sleeve dress, priced at 48,000 yuan. I believe this dress’s style and fit would suit your elegant demeanor perfectly.”

“Please take me to the fitting room after we check out,” Stella instructed.

“Of course,” Xiao Wang nodded, sensing that this customer was quite taken with the dress.

After completing the payment, Stella received a notification from the system confirming her daily task completion.

However, she still had a random task left to fulfill. She gestured to Xiao Wang and said, “Can you pick out a bag and accessories that go well with this dress? Also, put together a few outfits that would suit me. The total price should not exceed 962,000 yuan, and I need to finish the payment within 30 minutes.”

Xiao Wang’s calm demeanor flickered with surprise.

As a top salesperson who had faced numerous challenges, she had never encountered a customer with such a peculiar demand before.

Setting a total price was understandable, as it indicated the customer wanted to spend that amount in the store.

But giving a time limit…

This was clearly a test of her professional abilities as a salesperson!

Taking on this challenge, Xiao Wang resolved to deliver a perfect shopping experience for this high-spending customer who intended to drop a million in-store!

Fueled with determination, she began scanning the shop for suitable clothing styles and accessories for Stella.

First, she paired the recently purchased blue dress with a blue PETITE MALLE handbag, blue FLAGS knee-high boots, and an LV VOLT 18K gold bracelet, along with LOUISF earrings as accessories, totaling 127,300 yuan.

Next, she selected a white patterned boxy jacket paired with high-waisted black shorts as Stella's second outfit. She also picked up a black PETITE MALLE handbag, MY LV CHAIN PILOT sunglasses, and an LV VOLT 18K gold ring, along with LV VOLT diamond earrings, bringing the total to 275,000 yuan.

The third outfit featured a boxy shirt combined with tech knit pants, black SILHOUETTE ankle boots, a silver PETITE MALLE handbag, and B BLOSSOM 18K gold carnelian diamond earrings, totaling 149,300 yuan.

For the fourth outfit, she chose a black printed A-line coat layered over a fine-checked knit top and black wide-leg mini shorts, completing the look with black PATTI wedge boots, a dusty lavender BELTBAG COUSSIN handbag, and B BLOSSOM 18K gold onyx diamond earrings, which added up to 128,150 yuan.

Finally, for the fifth set, she opted for a double-breasted suit jacket with shoulder epaulettes, paired with high-waisted trousers, LV BEAUBOURG boots, and a black SPEEDY BANDOUUERE 20 handbag, along with EMPREINTE 18K gold bracelets and diamond rings, totaling 213,300 yuan.

To round it off, Xiao Wang also recommended two best-selling perfumes from the store.

Since the last recommended perfumes were pricier, Xiao Wang adjusted the pricing to ensure Stella could purchase everything for exactly 962,000 yuan.

As the transaction went through, Stella felt a rush of accomplishment.
