**The Glasses of the Queen Boss**

After the interviews this morning, Stella Ling successfully hired two administrative staff members, an accountant, and two drivers holding A1 licenses. Among them was Li Xiang, a 42-year-old woman with a college degree, over ten years of experience in administration and personnel, and more than eight years in management. Under the scrutiny of the Celestial Fortune System, her character level was rated as excellent.

After passing the interview, Stella decided to appoint Li Xiang as the Director of Administration and Personnel, offering her a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan with no probation period, double pay at year-end, and full social insurance and housing fund benefits. She didn’t give Li Xiang time to prepare and requested that she start working today.

Li Xiang was momentarily taken aback but accepted the position happily without any objections. 

The second administrative hire was an assistant named Chen Duo, a 25-year-old with a bachelor’s degree and two years of experience as an administrative assistant. Her character was also rated as excellent by the Celestial Fortune System. After passing the interview, Stella similarly required Chen Duo to start working immediately, to which she agreed with a smile. However, Chen Duo would have a three-month probation period with a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan, which would increase to 5,000 yuan upon confirmation, along with the same year-end bonus and benefits.

The accountant Stella hired was a 40-year-old named Zhou Yulan, who had a college degree and over eight years of financial experience, along with a certified public accountant qualification. After passing the interview, Stella directly appointed Zhou Yulan as the Financial Director with a salary of 30,000 yuan, no probation period, double pay at year-end, and full benefits, insisting that she sign the contract and start working immediately, which Zhou Yulan gladly accepted.

To Stella's surprise, she ended up hiring one more driver than planned. The two drivers were a married couple, Wang Ping and Lin Yueya, both over 40 years old with over ten years of experience driving buses. Their character levels were rated as one excellent and one good. The "excellent" here indicates a positive quality, meaning they prioritize others' interests over their own. Wang Ping was just that kind of person, and his wife Lin Yueya was no less worthy. Thus, Stella hired both of them at a monthly salary of 8,000 yuan, with no probation, double pay at year-end, and full benefits. 

Stella insisted that the couple start working today, as she had just assigned tasks to Financial Director Zhou Yulan to help her set up a basic company account and tax registration, which required the drivers.

Stella briefly explained the nature of the company and its development plans to Li Xiang, asking her to draft a set of management rules and regulations to review.

Suddenly, Stella realized that aside from her own fruit-branded laptop, none of the employees had work computers. So, she quickly called Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng to the temporary office in another serviced apartment and specifically asked Song Mengmeng to come without makeup.

Once the two artists Stella had signed arrived, she turned to her administrative assistant Chen Duo and said, “In a bit, please sort through the artist resumes in the company email. When I posted the recruitment ad, I requested candid, unfiltered full-body shots from various angles along with paper resumes, and I’m only hiring females.”

As she spoke, Stella pointed at Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng, “Their bare faces shouldn’t be worse than either of theirs. The height should be between 165 cm and 170 cm, and ages must be between 18 and 22. Having experience as a trainee or any special talents is a plus. Delete any resumes that don’t meet these criteria and save the ones that do separately.”

“Got it, I’ll take care of it,” Chen Duo nodded.

Afterward, Stella handed her fruit-branded laptop to Chen Duo and took Li Xiang and Lin Yueya out of the International Financial Building, driving towards a nearby Walmart supermarket.

Upon arriving at Walmart, Stella asked the experienced Li Xiang to assist her in purchasing necessary office supplies. “President Ling, we could go to the wholesale market; it’s cheaper there,” Li Xiang suggested.

Stella pulled out a Walmart shopping card and said, “Not for now. There’s 100,000 yuan on this card; let’s spend it first.” 

“...Alright,” Li Xiang replied after a moment's hesitation. 

Stella headed directly to the section selling fruit-branded desktop computers, causing Li Xiang to feel a bit uneasy. Stella intended to choose the best configurations and buy three, so she turned to Li Xiang and asked, “Which color do you prefer?”

She really intended to buy such expensive office equipment! Li Xiang was astonished but didn’t want to waste her boss's time, quickly responding, “Pink.”

“Okay, we’ll take one pink,” Stella said, continuing, “I wonder what Zhou Yulan and Chen Duo like.”

Since they were all women, she figured pink computers would work for everyone. Besides the desktops, Stella also planned to equip a large printer worth over 30,000 yuan. 

In addition, she needed to buy a projector, fax machine, scanner, switch, router, office chairs, ledgers, carbonless copy invoices, receipts, and other office supplies. When they reached the checkout, the 100,000 yuan on the shopping card wasn’t nearly enough.

**[Today’s daily task released: spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!]**

**[Random task triggered: spend 10 million yuan within 4 hours!]**

Perfect! Now that the money isn’t enough, fortune has come to the rescue!

“Fortune, you rock!” Stella praised inwardly.

**[Hmm!]**

Fortune was quite pleased. 

Stella exhausted the funds on the Walmart shopping card and then paid an additional 67,000 yuan in cash, completing the office supply shopping spree. 

Once the group had moved the supplies back to the apartment with the help of the supermarket staff, Stella found that Zhou Yulan had already completed the tasks she assigned.

“The basic account is set up. When can we use it?” Stella asked Zhou Yulan.

Zhou Yulan nodded, replying, “President Ling, it can be used right now. I’ve also set up the online banking for the corporate account.”

Quick! Stella thought she’d have to wait a few more days. 

With that in mind, Stella communicated with Fortune in her mind, “If I deposit the task funds into the company’s basic account as operational funds, does that count as completing the task?”

**[Yes, but once you deposit it, that money can only be used for business operations, not for personal gain.]**

“Don’t worry about that!” Stella assured.

Then, following Zhou Yulan’s instructions, she logged onto the corporate online banking and transferred the remaining funds of 9,943,000 yuan from the random task.

After completing the random task, Stella clicked to draw a prize. The pointer spun around and finally landed in the physical rewards section.

“Glasses of the Queen Boss? What’s this reward?” Stella wondered, clicking on the reward area. Information about the glasses appeared before her.

The Queen Boss’s Glasses were a specially customized physical reward for the host. Wearing these glasses would correct any vision defects and bestow a layer of boss-like aura, enhancing her personal charisma and intimidating others.

Stella claimed the reward and discreetly pulled out the Queen Boss’s glasses from her bag. The name may sound frivolous, but the glasses themselves looked quite stylish. The arms were black with gold wire frames, and the lenses were slightly oversized, capable of covering half her face.

When Stella put on the golden-framed glasses, her vision instantly became clearer. Looking towards Chen Duo, who was the farthest away, she could even see the small mole at the corner of her mouth.

Feeling her gaze, Chen Duo looked up and, startled, immediately lowered her head, fixating on her computer screen.

Did I just get caught daydreaming? 

President Ling looks so stern! What a strong aura! 

It’s tough to find a job these days! 

I don’t want to get fired after just one day! 

With that thought, Chen Duo hurriedly composed herself, fully concentrating on her resume screening. 

Stella was puzzled; Chen Duo clearly looked frightened. She turned her attention to Li Xiang, who, upon noticing her gaze, glanced over quickly and then lowered her head to continue her work.

Stella couldn’t help but sigh. Even though the newly appointed Director of Administration and Personnel appeared calm, Stella was sure that Li Xiang was also intimidated by her current appearance.

She took out a makeup mirror to check her reflection and then snapped the mirror shut in a hurry.

In a daze, she momentarily saw the face of her high school principal. 

Stella recalled the sound of high heels tapping on the hallway floor, echoing like a beating drum in her tense heart. She remembered the sharp gaze from the small window in the classroom’s back door, a look of concern from the principal.

Feeling mischievous, Stella stepped out of the apartment and headed towards the one where Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng were staying. 

She took out her apartment key, quietly opened the door, and tiptoed inside. 

In the living room, Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng were sitting side by side on the sofa, watching a video on their phones, giggling and chatting.

“Cough!” 

Stella intentionally cleared her throat, wanting to grab their attention. 

As she hoped, Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng turned their heads. 

Only Xu Shujun was startled, nearly dropping her phone. Jumping off the sofa, she nervously told Stella, “President Ling, I’ll go practice dancing right away!” 

“No need to be nervous; I just wanted to check how you two were getting along,” Stella said, suppressing her laughter.

To help Xu Shujun relax, Stella took off her glasses and continued, “It’s noon now; what do you want for lunch?” 

Seeing Stella’s warm demeanor return without the glasses, Xu Shujun visibly relaxed and said, “Anything’s fine.” 

Song Mengmeng, however, seemed a bit disappointed but didn’t forget about lunch, replying, “As long as it’s not too spicy; I can’t eat spicy food.”

Approaching Stella, Song Mengmeng quietly asked, “President Ling, can I borrow your glasses for a moment?” 

“Of course.” 

Stella replied, handing the glasses to Song Mengmeng. 

Once Song Mengmeng put on the glasses, she turned to the other two with excitement, saying, “So, how do I look? Do I seem cool?” 

“Hmm… like a student,” Xu Shujun honestly remarked.

The Queen Boss’s glasses were a custom reward for Stella as a system host; others wearing them wouldn’t receive the boss-like aura, making it no different from a regular pair of glasses. 

Thus, with the golden-framed glasses on, Song Mengmeng appeared more demure and resembled a playful student trying on a teacher’s glasses, especially with her half-pink, half-black long hair clashing with the look.

Upon hearing Xu Shujun’s comment, Song Mengmeng rushed to the bathroom to check her reflection. After a while, she returned looking dejected, taking off the glasses and returning them to Stella.

Stella smiled as she accepted the glasses and put them back on, instantly boosting her aura impressively. 

Stella’s striking appearance left Song Mengmeng starry-eyed, while Xu Shujun felt the urge to escape the apartment. 

On graduation day, Stella took an early flight to the capital. 

Upon arriving at her dorm, she found her roommates, except for Wang Lingling, were already there. 

Seeing Stella, Yang Dan joyfully approached her. 

“小星, long time no see!” 

After greeting her, Yang Dan pointed at the clothing on Stella's desk, saying, “I’ve picked up your graduation robe; hurry and change! The counselor notified us to participate in the graduation ceremony at 9 AM, take photos at 11, and then have a farewell meal at Qinghua Garden.” 

“Thank you,” Stella smiled in gratitude. 

“小星, you look so beautiful after not seeing you for a long time!” 

Liu Lu exclaimed upon seeing her roommate after three months. 

She couldn’t pinpoint what exactly made Stella look better; it was just that her aura was astonishing, and her skin radiated brightness. 

“Thanks, you look stunning too.” 

After complimenting Liu Lu, Stella also noticed her friend had changed significantly; her new hairstyle and makeup made her even more beautiful than before.

“Hehe, I think so too,” Liu Lu beamed, cupping her face with her hands. 

In the next moment, Yang Dan elbowed Liu Lu in the lower back. 

“Aren’t you embarrassed?” 

“You’re the one who’s not embarrassed!” 

The two laughed and began playfully chasing each other around the dorm. 

Stella chuckled while putting on her graduation robe. 

She touched the smooth fabric, reflecting on the moment. 

Today was her graduation day. 

Once dressed in her graduation robe, the three of them stepped out of the dorm. 

Since there was still some time before the ceremony, they began taking photos around the campus. 

Stella felt regretful, wondering why she hadn’t thought of buying a camera! 

Oh well, the fruit phone’s camera quality isn’t bad. 

Today marked the graduation ceremony at the Capital Foreign Language University, and countless students were capturing memories around the campus, much like Stella and her friends. 

Just as they were enjoying themselves, one person’s appearance shattered the joy, causing all three of them to frown.

The public enemy of Room 505, Wang Lingling, was striding towards them.
