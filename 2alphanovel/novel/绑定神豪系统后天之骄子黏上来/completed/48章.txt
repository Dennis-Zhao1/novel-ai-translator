Self-Funded

"Due to the length of this vehicle exceeding 6 meters, you must hold an A1 driver's license to drive it," He Yan concluded her explanation.

Earlier, Miss Ling had mentioned that the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter was for the company’s artists, indicating she didn’t intend to drive it herself. Given her background, it’s unlikely she could afford to hire a driver with an A1 license.

"Got it," Stella Ling nodded, realizing she would need to hire a driver who could operate a bus.

"Alright, I understand now. Can you introduce me to another vehicle priced around 7 million, something with a good driving experience and easy to handle?" Stella Ling stated.

"Sure, Miss Ling," He Yan nodded and then asked, "Do you have any brand preferences?"

"No special requirements, just as long as it doesn't insult China and is easy to drive," Stella Ling indicated.

"Um..." 

He Yan froze for a moment. The brand of the business vehicle that Miss Ling had just purchased was notorious for stepping on landmines regarding Chinese sentiments. It could be said they had a long history of missteps and had clearly not learned their lesson.

"What's wrong?" 

Seeing the troubled expression on He Yan's face, Stella Ling inquired.

Wait, would it be possible that every foreign car brand has insulted China at some point? What kind of trend is this? 

With such a vast market in China, why wouldn't they focus on maintaining a good relationship? It's absurd for someone selling goods to adopt a high and mighty attitude and insult their customers. 

A bunch of lunatics!

"If there really aren't any good foreign cars to recommend, just show me some domestic ones," Stella Ling suggested.

"No, Miss Ling, the brand you just bought..." 

He Yan started, but she couldn’t finish because her superior, Sales Director Zhang Xiaoguang, was giving her a signal to stop.

Was he indicating she shouldn't mention it? 

Unexpectedly, the general manager, Peng Lide, stepped forward and pinched Zhang Xiaoguang hard on the waist, then explained to Stella Ling, "Miss Ling, I sincerely apologize. The brand of the business vehicle you just purchased has had some ambiguous attitudes towards China and has produced a few advertisements that weren’t well-received here."

"However, the three business vehicles you bought have been internally and externally modified, and their three-pointed star logos have been replaced with the KLASSEN logo. You can consider them as KLASSEN vehicles."

"Of course, if you’re not satisfied, we can arrange a return and let you choose again."

Peng Lide expressed his sincerity.

Zhang Xiaoguang, who had just been pinched, was left in shock. The general manager was really willing to take a loss himself rather than offend this young woman. 

Who exactly is this Miss Ling? 

She seems to have a solid background, looks well-off, but lacks knowledge about car brands?

Stella Ling never imagined that what caused this group to feel awkward was this particular matter.

She glanced at Mr. Peng, sensing that he wasn’t being deliberately rude.

If there wasn’t a market in China, this dealership wouldn’t have stocked that brand of car in the first place.

She also realized it was her own fault for not researching the car brands' past controversies beforehand. Stella Ling understood, "It’s fine; no need to return it. Just like you said, I’ll regard it as a KLASSEN vehicle."

"Thank you for your understanding. We assure you this mistake won’t happen again," Peng Lide slightly bowed in apology before signaling He Yan to continue with the introduction.

Afterward, He Yan led Stella Ling away from the area with problematic car brands.

From this encounter, Liu, Peng, Zhang, and He all made a note in their minds that Miss Ling was a patriotic youth, and they shouldn’t recommend foreign brands with questionable political stances in the future.

Next, He Yan brought Stella Ling to a powerful-looking black sedan.

"This is a customized Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge, which was transformed from the Cullinan released in May 2018," He Yan explained as she opened the car door.

"What sets it apart from other luxury SUVs is its exclusive umbrella on the door. Press the button, and the umbrella will automatically pop out."

As He Yan pressed the button on the side of the door, an umbrella sprang out. She pulled it out and opened it, demonstrating it to Stella Ling.

"This car targets young people, so the umbrella is designed in a black and white color scheme, giving it a more vibrant look, unlike the somber black. The handle is engraved with Rolls-Royce's iconic logo."

He Yan retracted the umbrella, holding it above her head as Stella Ling noticed the double "R" logo engraved on the bottom of the handle.

Then, He Yan placed the umbrella back and gently stroked the car door while explaining, "The car features a traditional exterior color called 'King of the Night,' a unique hue for the Cullinan Black Badge. This paint requires over ten rounds of hand polishing."

Moving to the back of the car, she continued, "The rear design retains the classic Rolls-Royce features while incorporating the minimalist, avant-garde, and fashionable elements of the Cullinan."

He Yan picked up the car key and pressed the unlock button: "Press it, and the door will automatically open, showcasing its technological appeal."

Stella Ling watched as the door opened, a wave of luxury washing over her, making her feel like this was the essence of wealth.

Following He Yan's instructions, she sat in the driver's seat. 

Gripping the steering wheel, she was pleased with the feel; the entire interior looked luxurious. 

The black floor mats were made of wool. 

The dashboard featured carbon fiber accents, and the entire cockpit was wrapped in luxurious leather, topped with the iconic starlit ceiling of Rolls-Royce. 

Chromed seat adjustment buttons were located on the side of the seat, and the door bore the emblem of the Flying Lady.

Stella Ling recalled that the car Lu Mingxu drove into school also had this emblem.

So, she and he would be driving the same brand of car?

At least the exterior was different; otherwise, she wouldn't even consider purchasing it.

At this moment, He Yan leaned in closer to explain, "The speaker covers on the doors and all the buttons are chrome-plated."

Stella Ling noticed a cover beneath the windshield that automatically opened to reveal the car's display screen.

"This is the infotainment system, and beside it is a Phantom clock. The hollow panel is made of carbon fiber, and both the air conditioning and volume controls are adjusted using knobs. Below, there are two cup holders for heating or cooling beverages."

"There are also several storage compartments on the central console for small items like phones."

"The central knob also bears the emblem of the Flying Lady, allowing you to control the entire infotainment system display."

He Yan opened the rear door and continued, "Although it’s an SUV, the Cullinan also maintains the signature Rolls-Royce coach doors. Plus, with a length of 5.3 meters, it makes entering and exiting the vehicle much easier."

"Since the doors are coach-style, closing them from inside can be inconvenient. Therefore, there’s a button on the pillar; press it, and the door will close automatically."

He Yan pressed the button, demonstrating as the rear door slowly closed on its own.

"The rear air conditioning control panel also features a cigarette lighter."

"The central armrest in the back needs to be opened manually, and it also has two cup holders for heating or cooling drinks, along with storage space for important documents."

"The seats are very plush, designed in a black and white color scheme, making them look youthful."

"Up front, there’s a small shelf-like design that adds a bit more storage space."

He Yan began operating the windows, saying, "The windows of this Cullinan are thicker than standard car glass, but they don't have bulletproof capabilities."

Stella Ling stepped out of the driver's seat, glancing at the hood where the Flying Lady was painted black. She watched as He Yan struggled to open the engine hood and continued her introduction.

"All Rolls-Royce models use a V12 engine. This Cullinan is equipped with a V12 twin-turbocharged engine that provides a maximum power of 600 horsepower and a peak torque of 900 Nm."

After finishing, He Yan closed the hood, sat in the driver's seat, and started the car, saying, "You can listen to the exhaust note of this Cullinan V12."

Stella Ling, not understanding much, directly asked, "So, this car is 7 million, right?"

Upon hearing this, He Yan glanced at Mr. Peng, who nodded slowly, biting his lip, and smiled, "Yes, the final price for this car is 7 million."

After the payment, Stella Ling turned to He Yan, her curiosity piqued, "Is your store selling modified cars? Why have all four cars I purchased been modified inside and out?"

He Yan: "..."

He Yan was unsure how to respond, as these custom vehicles were specifically tailored for high-end clients.

Usually, Sales Director Zhang Xiaoguang was responsible for scouting such high-end customers, while she handled the sales pitches.

Before Miss Ling arrived, Mr. Peng had specifically instructed her to recommend high-end customized vehicles, saying that wealthy people with connections despised driving the same cars as others.

Peng Lide suddenly stepped forward, explaining for He Yan, "I took the liberty of assuming that only high-end custom cars would be worthy of someone of your stature, Miss Ling, and specifically instructed Xiao He to introduce those to you."

"Ah, thank you, I really like it," Stella Ling replied with a forced smile.

Suddenly, she realized that both Manager Liu and Mr. Peng had been overly courteous towards her.

Was she really living in the 21st century? 

Why were these middle-aged men, who were quite a bit older than her, acting like they were beneath her?

Good service is one thing, but this seemed excessive...

Feeling like she still had 10,000 yuan left to spend from her task funds, Stella Ling opened the Walmart online shopping app on her phone and directly recharged her shopping card with 10,000 yuan.

A few days ago, she had also used her daily task funds to recharge the Walmart shopping card.

This shopping card could be used both online and offline, and whenever she wasn't sure where to spend her daily task funds, she found it most convenient to recharge shopping cards or membership cards, or shop online to complete her tasks quickly.

Just as Stella Ling and Manager Liu stepped out of the 4S dealership, Zhang Xiaoguang rushed over to Mr. Peng, asking, "Mr. Peng, the final price of that car was 9.5 million, and you sold it to Miss Ling at a discount of 2.5 million. How will you cover that gap?"

"… Sigh, I'll just transfer the funds to you later," Peng Lide sighed in response.

Zhang Xiaoguang was left dumbfounded. He hadn’t expected the typically stingy Mr. Peng to cover a 2.5 million loss out of his own pocket!

Despite owning 12 4S dealerships, six of them were operating at a loss due to poor management.

Moreover, since car prices were now openly transparent, it was difficult for 4S dealerships to earn money just from selling cars.

The primary profits for 4S dealerships came from factory rebates based on sales volume, insurance commissions, profits from car accessories, various fees, and the most significant income source came from subsequent car repairs and maintenance, which accounted for 60% to 70% of their revenue.

Typically, relying solely on car sales, rebates, and accessories, a car priced at 100,000 yuan might yield a profit of just over 10,000 yuan. But with after-sales service and maintenance, the long-term profit could exceed 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Mr. Peng ran a boutique 4S dealership specializing in high-end automotive brands, with significant investments, particularly in land usage fees.

If profits were normal, a single store could yield around 20 million a year.

However, with half of the dealerships operating at a loss and others not meeting profitability standards, the overall profit might only reach around 30 million a year.

Mr. Peng had even considered shutting down the poorly performing stores, fearing that continuing operations would drag down the profitable ones and ultimately cut into his savings.

While he had several hundred million in assets, those who had interacted with him understood how frugal he was. He would haggle over clothing prices and even sent a 0.08 yuan red envelope to Zhang Xiaoguang to help negotiate a deal on an online shopping platform!

At that moment, Zhang Xiaoguang finally grasped the truth: wealthy individuals didn't throw money around; they were truly stingy, whereas he was merely the kind who was "poor but generous."

Sometimes, Zhang Xiaoguang struggled to understand why those worth tens or hundreds of millions were so frugal in their daily expenses. What was the point of earning money if they were so tight-fisted?

Over time, he began to realize that wealthy individuals were shrewd rather than stingy. They assessed the value of products, sought out quality items, and still negotiated for the best price. 

But now, this astute Mr. Peng was prepared to lose 2.5 million just to please Miss Ling!

He hoped Mr. Peng's judgment would prove correct and that he wouldn’t regret this decision after the 2.5 million loss.

In fact, at this moment, Mr. Peng's heart was bleeding.

His dealership actually had high-end customized vehicles priced around 7 million, but all those brands were Mercedes.

With Miss Ling being a patriotic youth, he couldn’t risk having his subordinates recommend that brand to her.

He had to find another high-end custom vehicle from a different brand that was close in price and met Miss Ling's requirements.

And it turned out they were 2.5 million apart!

Hopefully, Miss Ling was as impressive as Old Liu described her.

Otherwise...

Otherwise, he wouldn’t know what to do. 

On the way, Stella Ling suddenly heard Zhaocai speaking in her mind.

【Xiaoxing, I just heard that the price of that Cullinan was 9.5 million, and Mr. Peng sold it to you for 2.5 million less, planning to cover the loss out of his own pocket!】

Stella Ling: "…"

Why would he do that?

Stella Ling was confused.

【I feel like he wants to cry.】
