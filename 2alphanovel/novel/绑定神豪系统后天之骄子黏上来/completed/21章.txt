Fixed Amount

The day before yesterday, Stella Ling received a random task reward of 10,000 yuan from the system, which she used to buy a new phone. Today, for her daily task, the system sent her another 10,000 yuan. After giving it some thought, she decided to purchase a laptop. 

Her second-hand laptop had become so sluggish that it was nearly unusable, so getting a new one would be a good choice. Sitting on the toilet, she opened the Tmall app on her phone and started searching. 

Her new fruit-branded phone had a crystal-clear display and operated smoothly; it was evident that spending more money had its advantages. Therefore, for this laptop, she wanted to stick with the same brand. 

Stella's current second-hand laptop had a 15.6-inch screen, which she had grown accustomed to, so she wasn't considering any smaller models. Clicking into the official flagship store of the fruit brand, she was shocked to find that the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with the best configuration cost a staggering 26,499 yuan! Even the lowest configuration was priced at 18,999 yuan! 

Seeing these prices made Stella hesitate. Perhaps she should consider a smaller screen after all. After all, she could get used to it over time. Checking the 13-inch fruit-branded laptop revealed that the lowest configuration was just under 10,000 yuan at 9,999 yuan, and she could use the leftover yuan to recharge her phone credit.

As she was about to click the purchase button, she stared at the payment page, feeling increasingly uncomfortable. Shouldn't she just buy something better? Although it cost more than double, wouldn't it be more comfortable to use?

After contemplating for a while, Stella decided to go for the 16-inch MacBook Pro priced at 26,499 yuan, which meant she had to dip into her own savings for an extra 16,499 yuan. 

【Congratulations, Stella! You've completed today's daily task! Keep up the good work tomorrow!】

With this purchase, the 100,000 yuan she had won in the lottery previously, after paying back Lu Mingxu, had decreased significantly. However, she felt a sense of satisfaction, believing that spending more on a better-configured laptop was worth it.

Today's daily task funding had increased tenfold compared to yesterday. Considering that tomorrow's task funding might also increase tenfold, Stella decided she needed to think ahead about what she should buy for the next day.

"Tomorrow is 100,000 yuan, and the day after that will be a million. So then the day after tomorrow..." 

Stella couldn't help but daydream. If that were true, she wouldn't even need to rent a place anymore! She could buy a house in the city directly!

But that was all uncertain, and she had a nagging feeling that the task funding wouldn’t grow that dramatically. If it truly increased tenfold every time, she'd be richer than some countries! 

【Yes, you’re correct; the daily task funding won’t increase that quickly.】 
【At this stage, 10,000 yuan is the fixed amount for daily tasks.】 
【To increase the daily task funding, you will need to rely on the system's lottery to draw skills that can enhance the funding amount. Only then will the daily task amount see any growth.】

Stella nodded in understanding, saying, “So it turns out, tomorrow’s daily task amount is still 10,000 yuan.” 

She felt very content with being able to spend 10,000 yuan daily. Even if she never drew skills to increase that amount, she thought it was alright. 

Since the store where Stella made her order was located in the city, and she had an hour left before getting off work, the fruit laptop she ordered was promptly delivered by the courier to her office. 

Stella didn’t open the package, but her colleague Wang Lingling caught sight of the product name on the courier box and mocked, “Heh, did you spend your entire internship salary on that fruit laptop?” 

Stella found it a bit amusing and retorted, “Is your salary higher than mine?” 

They earned the same wage, so who was she to mock? She didn’t laugh at Wang Lingling for spending her parents' money on bags and clothes, so why should she be judged? 

Wang Lingling, furious, began to throw a tantrum at her workstation. She hated it when others brought up her salary! 

Why should she be earning the same as these poor souls? Her monthly salary couldn’t even afford the cheapest bag from the store! 

Fortunately, she was about to break free from this class soon! Then all those who looked down on her would have to look up to her! 

Including Stella Ling! 

What good was her outstanding translation ability? Class divisions couldn’t be crossed by mere linguistic skills! 

Stella was annoyed by the noise Wang Lingling was making, but thankfully, she wouldn’t have to deal with her pretentiousness anymore after today. 

The next day's daily task funding indeed remained unchanged, just like the system had said, at 10,000 yuan. 

Stella received her daily task during her lunch break. With only 30 minutes for the task, she set her lunch box down and rushed out of the company to the nearby Hongxing Erke store to buy two pairs of shoes. 

One pair was fluorescent nude-colored PB carbon plate cushioning sneakers, priced at 1,118 yuan. The other pair was a versatile pair of white shoes, priced at 470 yuan. 

Stella had always held a good impression of Hongxing Erke, a company known for its charitable endeavors. Unfortunately, she hadn’t been able to afford their products before, as her old shoes hadn’t yet worn out. 

Now that she had money that couldn’t be saved and had to be spent, purchasing these two pairs felt like fulfilling a small wish to support a conscientious domestic brand. 

Afterward, Stella went to a nearby outdoor sportswear store to buy two sets of sportswear, including two casual short-sleeved shirts, shorts, and two sports bras. 

One sportswear set was a gentle pink jacket paired with black tapered long pants, priced at 1,075 yuan. The other set was a beige hooded jacket with gray casual long pants, priced at 988 yuan. 

The casual short-sleeved shirts were priced at 399 yuan and 299 yuan, respectively, while the shorts were 399 yuan and 499 yuan. The two sports bras were both priced at 499 yuan. 

Stella thought that her sprinting champion skill shouldn’t go to waste. However, her physical condition was too poor. If she used that skill again, she would likely end up with cramps in her legs. 

So, Stella decided that once her leg injury fully healed, she would start morning runs to improve her fitness. She aimed to strengthen her body to the point where she could use her sprinting champion skill without any issues. 

Yet, she felt that this goal would be hard to achieve. Perhaps only a true world sprint champion could use that skill without putting too much strain on their body. 

But how could she know it wouldn’t work if she didn’t try? 

After buying the aforementioned sports gear, she had 3,755 yuan left from her task funding. 

Stella felt a bit overwhelmed; there were many things she needed, but it would take more time to buy them. With only 15 minutes left until the task deadline, there simply wasn’t enough time. 

Why did the most expensive shoes at the Hongxing Erke store only cost 1,118 yuan? If only there had been something pricier, she wouldn’t be feeling so troubled about spending! 

Stella didn’t dwell on it for long and quickly returned to the store where she had bought the sportswear. There, she spent 299 yuan on a black waist bag and 199 yuan on a pink-purple small backpack, and then 398 yuan on two breathable UV protection caps, both in black but with different styles. 

She also spent 327 yuan on nine pairs of differently colored sports socks and 389 yuan on a pink sports water bottle. 

With 2,143 yuan left, Stella decided to open her takeaway app and spent 895 yuan on a five-person takeaway set from the most famous roast duck restaurant in the city, leaving her with 1,248 yuan to recharge into her taxi app. 

As she walked out of the outdoor sports brand store, Stella felt her hand tremble as she held the water bottle; this was the most expensive plastic water bottle she had ever bought! 

Her colleagues in the office were shocked to see Stella return from lunch with so many items. 

Colleague Yang Lan approached her curiously and asked what she had bought. 

“It’s just some sports gear, like shoes and clothes,” Stella replied with an awkward smile. 

If it weren’t for the lack of storage space, she wouldn’t have wanted to bring all this back to the office and draw attention to herself. 

“Are you planning to exercise?” 

Another colleague at Stella's workstation asked her. 

“Yeah, I feel like my health isn’t great, so I want to start morning runs to get fit,” Stella replied. 

“Hongxing Erke... NaiKe! Did you spend a lot on that brand of sportswear?” Yang Lan noticed the brand logo on the shopping bag and inquired. 

“Yeah, I wanted something durable, so I opted for the pricier brand,” Stella made up an excuse, thinking that if she didn’t have to spend that 10,000 yuan in half an hour, she wouldn’t have bought such expensive sportswear. 

In reality, to get fit for morning runs, she didn’t need to spend money on gear; she could have just worn her high school gym clothes, which were warm and durable enough. 

“Brand-name clothing does tend to be of better quality,” a colleague nodded in agreement. 

“Hmph!” 

At that moment, a cold snort came from beside Stella, followed by someone slamming down documents on the desk and aggressively clicking their mouse, as if they wouldn’t stop until they broke it. 

Seeing this, some colleagues left, but Yang Lan rolled her eyes in the direction of Wang Lingling before saying to Stella, “Alright, I won’t keep you any longer. You should eat before it gets cold.” 

“Okay, thanks, Yang Jie. Take care.” Stella smiled. 

Sometimes, Stella really couldn’t understand Wang Lingling. Why did someone always have to act this way when they saw others buying nice things? What kind of small-mindedness was that? 

After work that afternoon, Stella carried her shopping bags out of the office. The taxi she had called through the app was already waiting at the entrance of the building. 

Since the company was not far from the Quanjude roast duck restaurant, walking would take over 20 minutes, but since she had just recharged her taxi app, why walk when she could take a ride? 

Besides, her leg injury wasn’t fully healed yet; after walking for a bit, her calves would feel sore and swollen. Until her leg fully recovered, Stella planned to rely on taking taxis instead of walking. After all, the taxi fare was free for her. 

Five minutes later, the car Stella was in stopped in front of Quanjude. 

Not long after entering, Stella picked up the five-person roast duck set she had ordered for takeaway, scheduled to be picked up at 5:20 PM.
