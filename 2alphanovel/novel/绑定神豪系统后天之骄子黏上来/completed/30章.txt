**Confession**

Stella Ling wasn't being petty; it was just that the fact she had a system had to remain a secret. She couldn't let anyone find out.

The system revealed its true form, a small, joyful cat, and replied, "No, no! I can come out!"

Watching the little cat bounce happily around the room, Stella thought it might be a good idea to buy some cat supplies for her new place. If anyone came over, the system could disguise itself as a real kitten.

Though the apartment was rented, Stella didn’t plan to stay there tonight. Her spare clothes and toiletries were still at the dorm; she needed to move everything over before settling in comfortably.

Moreover, Stella's phone had received numerous messages about her deliveries—snacks she and the system ordered online last night had arrived, and she needed to go to the campus delivery station to pick them up.

After locking the door behind her, Stella took a taxi to the university. As she approached the dorms, she noticed a commotion nearby.

Listening closely, it sounded like someone was confessing their feelings at the base of the dormitory!

Curious, Stella walked over, wanting to see which younger student was so popular. Before she got close, she heard a nightmarish shout.

“Stella Ling! Class 2 of the 2018 Language Department!”

It was Lu Mingxu!

Stella immediately turned to run, but Lu Mingxu continued to shout, “I like you! I want to be good friends with you!”

“If you don’t come down today, I’ll come here every day until you agree!”

Oh no! Stella couldn’t help but curse under her breath, muttering some expletives in her mind. It seemed Lu Mingxu didn’t know she wasn’t in the dorm anymore; he hadn’t figured out she was standing nearby.

Realizing this, Stella grabbed her bag to cover her face and glanced up at the dorm—only to find her room’s lights were on.

Hmm? Did she have a roommate back?

A crowd of students had gathered at the base of the dormitory, watching the scene unfold. 

Stella crept closer, blending into the onlookers, trying to peek through the gaps to see what was happening with Lu Mingxu. She noticed he was holding a huge bouquet of pink roses.

The streetlights illuminated Lu Mingxu perfectly, making it clear who was confessing. 

Seeing this, Stella felt her toes digging into the ground in embarrassment, as if wishing they could break through the soles of her shoes. 

She remembered how she initially thought it would be fun to watch others make fools of themselves and couldn’t help but want to slap herself. 

Now, she understood the feelings of those women who had been publicly confessed to. If they reciprocated feelings, then it might be a joyful experience, but if they didn’t know the confessing person or didn’t like them, such a confession was sheer torture!

“Wow! That guy is so handsome!”

“What a shame, he’s about to be someone else's boyfriend.”

“But I heard him say he wants to be friends? This isn’t a confession of love, is it?”

“Are you stupid? Why would you make such a big fuss to just be friends? This is definitely a confession!”

Listening to the students around her, Stella's brows knitted together, and her expression was one of distress. 

Is Lu Mingxu crazy? 

She had blocked him on WeChat and his phone number, clearly signaling she wanted nothing to do with him. Why was he still pestering her?

Honestly, why would he like a regular-looking girl like her? 

Stella was sure that every woman she saw that day in the KTV private room was better looking than her. 

Had Lu Mingxu's taste suddenly changed?

“Stella Ling, come out quickly!”

“Stella, your boyfriend is so handsome!”

“Stella, you should grab him!”

Gradually, some students who recognized Stella began to cheer Lu Mingxu on. 

Because of Lu Mingxu’s exceptional looks, everyone assumed he and Stella would definitely become a couple, and they started to cheer louder.

Finally, their collective voices turned into a chant: “Stella Ling, agree to him!”

“Stella Ling, agree to him!”

“Stella Ling, agree to him!”

Stella felt like she might faint from the pressure of the surrounding voices chanting in unison.

She understood that everyone was just caught up in the excitement, wanting to see a spectacle, just like she had earlier. 

But facing this situation, she realized how terrifying moral coercion from the public could be! The cheer was grating on her nerves!

Stella figured she wouldn’t be able to wait for the dorm supervisor to come out and disperse the crowd; she needed to escape back to her new place as soon as possible.

“Stella isn’t in the dorm, stop shouting!”

At that moment, a girl with short hair pushed open the window of room 505 and yelled down.

Stella looked up to see it was her dorm leader, Yang Dan. 

So that’s why the lights were on; Yang Dan had returned to school.

Stella felt a glimmer of hope. Surely, Lu Mingxu would hear this and leave, right?

But the next second, her hope was shattered.

“I don’t believe you!” Lu Mingxu shouted back. 

“Stella just avoids me!”

“She even blocked me on WeChat! You have to make her un-blacklist me!”

Upon hearing this, laughter erupted from the crowd.

Some girls even took out their phones, bravely walking up to shout, “Senior, add me on WeChat! I’d love to be friends with you!”

“I’d like to too!” another girl chimed in.

“I don’t want anyone else; I only want Stella!”

Lu Mingxu coldly rejected the advances, not even turning around, his eyes fixated on the window of room 505.

“I just want to be friends with her; tell her not to be afraid!” Lu Mingxu shouted at Yang Dan.

“Be friends? Who would believe that!”

“We don’t believe you!”

Hearing this, the crowd erupted in mocking jeers, while Yang Dan, standing by the window, was increasingly frustrated, running a hand through her short hair, unsure how to resolve the situation.

Stella really wasn’t in the dorm!

Who was she supposed to call?

Suddenly, Yang Dan remembered she had Stella's WeChat and used her phone to take a picture of the situation below, sending it to Stella with the message: “Stella, there’s an incredibly handsome guy confessing to you downstairs! Do you know him? When are you coming back?”

Noticing her phone vibrate, Stella pulled it out to check and saw Yang Dan had sent her a message.

Stella couldn’t reveal that she was right there; even if she wanted to keep it a secret, Yang Dan’s straightforward personality would surely spill the beans. So, she replied, “I’m living off-campus now, not returning to the dorm. I don’t know this lunatic in the picture. Yang Dan, can you get the dorm supervisor to help chase him away?”

Yang Dan: “…”

Stella called such a handsome guy a lunatic? She really was a woman who didn’t care about appearances!

Honestly, if that guy hadn’t been so good-looking and physically imposing, she would have wanted to go downstairs and give him a piece of her mind!

What was he thinking?

Didn’t he realize some girls didn’t like that kind of confession?

She had just gotten off the high-speed train and was catching up on sleep when a shout woke her up!

And of course, Stella would avoid him!

She thought he was a lunatic; why wouldn't she avoid him?

Yang Dan angrily closed the window, deciding to go downstairs and find the dorm supervisor to resolve the issue.

Seeing that Stella’s roommate had closed the window and there was no other response, Lu Mingxu could only keep shouting, “Stella…”

“That’s enough!” 

A male voice, laced with irritation, cut through Lu Mingxu's calls.

Lu Mingxu turned to see a familiar figure approaching him.

“Li Qizhen?”

Lu Mingxu was puzzled; wasn’t he the prince charming in his sister’s eyes and the dream boy in his parents' minds?

The Li and Lu families were both part of the elite families of the capital, but Lu Mingxu had never really mixed with Li Qizhen, who was a year older, and they had never run in the same social circles.

His two nominal older brothers, however, got along quite well with Li Qizhen.

What was he doing here, interrupting his confession?

A man's intuition can sometimes be surprisingly accurate, especially when two men like the same woman.

As Li Qizhen drew closer, Lu Mingxu felt a surge of anger rising within him.

Looking at the standoff between the two, it was as if the surrounding crowd sensed a brewing storm.

“Leave here; Stella wouldn’t like this way of confessing. You’re only making her uncomfortable,” Li Qizhen warned, his gaze steady as he addressed Lu Mingxu.

“Stella?” 

Lu Mingxu scoffed, finally understanding why he felt inexplicably annoyed since hearing Li Qizhen's voice.

“You know Stella? What’s your relationship with her?”

Lu Mingxu took a couple of steps closer to Li Qizhen, pressing him with a menacing intensity.

“It’s none of your business; this is between me and her,” Li Qizhen replied coldly, his handsome face unyielding.

“Between you and her?” 

Lu Mingxu laughed derisively, his eyes piercing like icicles aimed at Li Qizhen, his voice laced with scorn, “This isn’t just about you and her; it also involves me because Stella's business is my business!”

Watching the two face off, Stella felt her mind go blank for a moment.

Why was Li Qizhen here?

Did that mean he had come to find her?

But if so, why couldn’t he just text her?

And wait, did Li Qizhen and Lu Mingxu know each other…?

“Oh my gosh! That guy is also so handsome!”

“Is he here to confess to Stella too?”

“Who exactly is Stella Ling? The flower of the Language Department?”

“No, she’s a senior in her fourth year, pretty average looking, but she’s very low-key and gets scholarships every year.”

“Average looking? Why do such high-quality guys like her?”

“Both of these guys are incredibly handsome and have great charm; they’re basically Heaven’s Chosen Ones!”

The phrase "Heaven's Chosen Ones" seemed to trigger a memory in Stella, and she widened her eyes, looking at the two men surrounded by the crowd.

Stella began to realize why they were behaving like this!
