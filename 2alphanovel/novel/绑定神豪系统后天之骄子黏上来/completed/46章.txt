**Wealth and Ambition**

Under Stella Ling's encouragement, Song Mengmeng regained her confidence. 

Afterward, Stella explained the current state of the company to Song Mengmeng. Upon learning that Xingchen Entertainment had established its base in Rongcheng, Sichuan Province, and that the business license was still pending, Song Mengmeng quickly replied, “No worries, I can wait. I believe you’ll come to get me soon, President Ling.”

At this moment, Song Mengmeng had already regarded Stella as her mentor, and she would agree to whatever her future boss said.

The atmosphere was light and uplifting. Stella looked at Song Mengmeng, whose face was beaming with joy, and couldn’t help but express what had been on her mind. 

“Mengmeng, you should avoid attending drinking parties in the future. Our company forbids such activities.”

Stella felt a bit awkward; she didn’t want her company to be associated with any under-the-table dealings. It was crucial to make the rules clear to Song Mengmeng so she understood the company’s regulations.

Song Mengmeng was taken aback but quickly explained, “I didn’t agree to go to the drinking party with Lili. I spent the entire night working at several bars, singing. I didn’t go—I just…”

She just didn’t want to lose her friend Lili too soon.

Song Mengmeng remembered the first time she performed a Mongolian song; the excitement on Lili’s face and her heartfelt praise still lingered. They had been great friends, both training together in the same company, sweating for their common dreams. 

But slowly, Lili changed.

Song Mengmeng noticed Lili's transformation, but she didn’t know how to stop it. Lili simply wouldn’t listen to her. All she could do was try to maintain their friendship, hoping it would endure.

However, today she had turned Lili down again. She thought their once strong bond might finally be crumbling.

“...I just find it hard to refuse friends, but I definitely didn’t agree to anything!” Song Mengmeng promised.

Stella felt a wave of relief wash over her. “That’s great! Mengmeng, don’t worry. Xingchen Entertainment absolutely does not engage in any dirty business! If you’re still unsure, I can write a clause in your contract that prohibits such underhanded dealings. We’ll supervise each other and grow together!”

Stella believed that maintaining one’s principles in the face of losing moral integrity was valuable. It would allow one to walk proudly, earn respect, and gain trust!

“Okay!” Song Mengmeng nodded vigorously. Despite her desire to shine on stage, who wouldn’t want to sign with a company that was all about integrity and fairness, allowing them to truly pursue their ambitions?

“By the way, you mentioned you were working at several bars today. Isn’t that hard on your throat? As a singer, you need to take good care of your vocal cords. Don’t take any more bar jobs until your voice is fully healed.”

Stella advised, softening her tone as she asked, “Are you short on cash? I can lend you some, but just to clarify, this would be an advance on your salary, which you’ll need to pay back once you start earning.”

“No, I’m not short on money!” Song Mengmeng quickly shook her head. “My current company pays me 3,500 yuan a month. I share a rental and am very frugal with my expenses. It’s enough for me. I work at the bars to let more people hear Mongolian music, to see if there’s an audience, and to check if my style is as niche as I think.”

“I see,” Stella replied, understanding the reasoning. “Then please don’t work at the bars for now. Take good care of your voice and just wait for me to come get you.”

“Sure!” Song Mengmeng replied, her spirits lifted.

After being abandoned by her current company, Song Mengmeng had faced a significant blow. However, she quickly bounced back and began working at various bars to sing. During this time, she discovered that many people enjoyed her performances.

Several entertainment agents approached her with offers, but when they heard her cancellation fee, they quickly backed off. Perhaps they thought her niche style wasn’t worth investing in.

Song Mengmeng suddenly felt a wave of sadness wash over her. She felt incredibly lucky to be noticed by President Ling! 

She had originally thought she would be bound to her current company for another nine years, having signed a ten-year contract. That meant her trainee career had barely lasted a year.

Yet Stella believed that Song Mengmeng’s talent was more than sufficient; what she needed now was an excellent stage performance that would leave a mark on the audience.

When Song Mengmeng returned to her rental, it was already deep into the night. Perhaps she had consumed too much coffee, as Stella lay in bed with wide-open eyes, unable to feel any sleepiness.

Recalling Song Mengmeng’s performance at Black Whale Bar still filled her with excitement. Tossing and turning in bed, Stella found herself unable to sleep. She sat up, slightly parted her lips, and mimicked Song Mengmeng’s vocal techniques, experimenting with the sounds.

“Oh woo woo woo yeah yeah yeah, la la la, cough cough cough cough cough!”

As she exerted too much effort in her pronunciation, Stella began to cough.

Zhaocai: “…”

Noticing Zhaocai squinting at her with a look of feline disapproval, Stella’s face flushed as she collapsed back onto the bed, pulling the blanket over her head, curling up inside it.

Clearly, imitating a 9.6-rated master’s vocal technique was not as easy as it seemed.

Three days off passed, and besides Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng, Stella hadn’t managed to recruit any other promising trainees from other entertainment companies.

It wasn’t that she hadn’t encountered trainees with scores above 9. But those individuals were currently valued by their signed companies and looked down on Stella, who had set up her base in Rongcheng.

Why would they want to move to another area when they could thrive in the capital?

Or perhaps they dismissed Stella as a fraud. No matter how much she explained or guaranteed, they were unwilling to believe her claims.

Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng were genuinely lucky finds for Stella.

That morning, on her way to work, Stella received a WeChat message from Manager Liu at the Rongcheng International Financial Building’s property center.

He sent her several photos of workers diligently renovating and one photo of the newly made company rooftop sign.

Stella expressed satisfaction and replied, “Thank you for your hard work.”

Manager Liu quickly replied, “Not at all! This is what our property center is here for!”

“Miss Ling, if you have any dissatisfaction with the company’s renovation design or the sign design, please let me know. We will definitely modify it until you are satisfied.”

Stella typed back, “No need. The design draft you sent me the day before yesterday looks great. Just proceed with that version.”

Manager Liu responded promptly, “I’m glad you’re satisfied! I will supervise the work closely to ensure everything is completed as you requested.”

Stella didn’t reply further. Communicating with Manager Liu was exhausting; if she replied with “Okay” or “Thank you for your trouble,” he would inevitably send another lengthy response.

Let’s just leave it at that.

Stella forwarded the photos Manager Liu sent to the group chat that included only her, Xu Shujun, and Song Mengmeng. 

Before long, the small group chat buzzed with excitement as they engaged in enthusiastic discussions about the photos.

Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng had only met through Stella’s introduction yesterday when they all had dinner together.

Soon, they would be part of the same group, so getting to know each other’s personalities in advance was a good thing. 

It was a necessary process for any newly formed team—a phase of adjustment that couldn’t be skipped.

When Stella arrived at the company, she began her tedious translation work again.

During the lunch break, she was informed by the logistics department to pick up a parcel.

Stella was puzzled; ever since she moved, she hadn’t filled out her delivery address as her school or the company’s address.

So, she told the logistics staff, “This isn’t my parcel.”

“Really? It’s addressed to you.”

The staff handed the parcel to Stella and pointed out the recipient's name on the delivery slip.

She looked closely and confirmed it was indeed her name.

The sender was Sun Qing.

Stella vaguely remembered that Sun Qing was the jewelry consultant who had assisted her at the Gem Cage a few days ago. She was her VIP customer service representative.

Was this a gift from Gem Cage for VIP clients?

Stella felt a strange sense of foreboding and communicated with Zhaocai in her mind, “Zhaocai, can you see what’s inside this?”

【Let me take a look, wow!】

“What is it?” Stella asked mentally.

【It’s a cat-head-shaped piece of jewelry, and it looks just like me! It even has emeralds for eyes!】

No way!

After buying the jewelry, Stella hadn’t returned to Gem Cage for more.

A piece that resembled Zhaocai so closely must have been custom-made!

Sun Qing couldn’t have seen Zhaocai!

Who could it be? 

Was it Li Qicheng? Lu Mingxu? Or that guy with the surname Zhong?

Stella analyzed the possible culprits in her mind. The only individuals who would go to such lengths would be the Heaven’s Chosen Ones pursuing her fate.

It had to be the one with the surname Zhong; he was the only one who had seen Zhaocai.

The logistics staff noticed Stella staring blankly at the parcel and reminded her, “This should be your package, right?”

Stella quickly shook her head; she didn’t want to accept this parcel. She replied, “Please return it. I didn’t order anything, and I don’t have any friends or family sending me packages.”

“Alright, I’ll return it,” the staff said.

“Thank you for your help,” Stella replied, feeling a bit embarrassed.

Back at her workstation, Stella felt a mix of emotions for a while. 

So, was this an attempt to win her over with gifts? 

What a lunatic! 

Sending such expensive jewelry so casually!

Stella quickly messaged the jewelry consultant Sun Qing, asking if someone had custom-made jewelry at Gem Cage to send to her.

The response came quickly: “Yes, Miss Ling. Have you received the parcel?”

Upon confirming, Stella’s face fell into a frown as she typed back, “I saw it, but I didn’t accept it. The person who customized the jewelry is my stalker. I don’t want to accept his gifts. After the parcel is returned, please forward it back to him.”

“If he causes you any trouble and asks you to forward it to me, just tell him that if he continues to stalk and watch me for no reason and sends me inexplicable gifts, I will call the police to handle this matter!”

After sending that message, about ten minutes passed before she received a reply: “Understood. I’ll make sure to handle it.”

A few moments later, Sun Qing sent a voice message.

Stella converted the audio to text.

“Miss Ling, I’m truly sorry! When that gentleman came to our store to customize the jewelry, he clearly stated he knew you were our VIP customer and mentioned that you were friends. I took him at his word, believing you two were indeed friends. I had no idea he was your stalker! I didn’t mean to disclose your company address!”

Stella sighed, typing back, “I know you didn’t do it on purpose. That person’s identity is complicated. When you reply to him, try to be tactful. Shift any uncomfortable things onto me; he’ll understand it’s my intent.”

The response came back: “Okay, Miss Ling. I’m truly sorry!”

Stella didn’t reply further.

She felt a bit frustrated, but in the face of these Heaven’s Chosen Ones, avoiding them seemed the only viable option for now.

Thinking of the information she had gathered online about Li Qicheng a while back, Stella groaned to the system, “Zhaocai, Li Qicheng has a fortune of over 60 billion, while his father has over 300 billion. When will my wealth catch up to his father’s level so I don’t have to keep dodging these Heaven’s Chosen Ones?”

【Don’t worry! I’ll work hard to send you tasks! One day, you will become the richest person on this planet!】

Zhaocai declared earnestly.

“I’m glad I have you bound to me; otherwise, I wouldn’t even have a chance to rise. Just seeing the word ‘billion’ would make me want to back down.”

Stella felt grateful.

Without Zhaocai, she would be just an ordinary worker in this vast city, busy her entire life, and might not even earn 5 million.

As an unprivileged orphan with no power, what could she use to compete against those spoiled Heaven’s Chosen Ones?

With that thought, Stella genuinely wanted to give Zhaocai’s belly a comforting rub.

It seemed that Zhaocai sensed Stella’s unease and stealthily peeked out from her fragrant grandmother’s bag, exposing only its two fluffy ears, twitching as if calling her to come and pet it.

Stella looked around to ensure no one was watching her and promptly reached out her finger to poke Zhaocai’s furry little ear, whispering mischievously, “Zhaocai, if you could just let me draw the skill to conceal my luck quickly, all my worries would be solved~”

As soon as she said that, Zhaocai’s fluffy ears immediately retracted back into the bag, and the whole cat vanished, starting to chant in Stella’s mind.

【Very hard to draw! Very hard to draw! This skill can only be drawn under a highly lucky state of a strong luck person. It’s very difficult!】

“Alright, alright! I got it!” Stella hurriedly interrupted, her head buzzing from Zhaocai’s noise.

Can’t I just take my time with it?
