**Paying Back the Debt**

Stepping out of the jewelry store, Stella Ling held up the sapphire necklace with one hand, admiring its beautiful brilliance as it sparkled under the sunlight.

After making her purchase, she learned from the store clerk that the sapphire she now possessed was a standard royal blue, sourced from the Skara Kingdom, famous for its fine black tea. The sapphire was cut into an octagon and designed with a common micro-pavé diamond style.

The pavé diamonds were luxurious, resembling teardrops, and each diamond was roughly over ten points in size—quite large. The teardrop-shaped white diamonds were layered around the princess-cut sapphire, creating a striking sense of depth in the pendant design. The pendant's setting was made of 18k platinum, featuring a staggered mesh design on the back that gave it a strong three-dimensional feel.

This sapphire pendant came with an 18k platinum chain of the same material, and if Stella wanted to, she could wear it around her neck right now. But she felt that her outfit of a short-sleeved top and denim shorts didn’t quite match the elegance of the necklace. 

So, after thoroughly enjoying its beauty, Stella carefully placed the necklace and its certification into her shoulder bag. Interestingly, she had only just learned today that gemstones came with certification.

Overall, Stella was very satisfied with her shopping trip. If she ever found herself in urgent need of cash, she could always sell this sapphire necklace online. 

**[No way!]**  
**[Items purchased with system funds can be given to others, but you can never return or resell them for money!]**

“...Oh.”  
Stella felt a twinge of disappointment. She had been thinking that once the system issued her more task funds, she could stock up on gold at a jewelry store, then sell it later when prices rose. It seemed that plan was now off the table. She certainly wouldn’t give away such an expensive piece of jewelry to anyone!

Since selling it was out of the question, she figured she might as well keep it for herself; after all, she really liked this sapphire necklace~

Next came the random task completion lottery segment of the system. The lottery wheel was still divided into eight sections: four for cash, three for physical items, and one for skills.

“System, you mentioned yesterday that you’d send me money to help pay off my debt, right?” Stella asked, a sly smile on her face as she mentally communicated with the system before clicking on the lottery.

**[Ahem!]**  
**[Just keep it to yourself. Don’t bring it up! You’re making things difficult for this system!]**  
The system coughed lightly, giving her a quiet reminder.

Stella didn’t call out the system's previous hints, instead making an ‘OK’ sign with one hand, cheerfully responding, “Got it!”

She clicked on the lottery, and the pointer spun wildly before finally stopping in the cash reward section. A rush of nervous excitement coursed through Stella as she awaited her reward—how much money would the system give her?

**[Congratulations, Stella! You’ve won a cash prize of 100,000 yuan!]**  
**[The cash rewards from the lottery are not subject to system rules, so you can use this money however you wish!]**

In other words, this money had no task time limits; she could deposit it in the bank or give it to someone else—she could use it however she liked! The most important thing was that she now had enough money for rent!

As for the debt she owed to Lu Mingxu, no meal could possibly cost 100,000 yuan, right? 

With her worries resolved, Stella felt a surge of joy, humming a little tune as she skipped forward. Just a few steps later, however, she bent down, clutching her calf.

Ouch!  
One really shouldn’t get too carried away!

……

In a private dining room at the Jinghai Hotel, Lu Mingxu sat in casual attire, anxiously staring at his phone. The time on his phone showed he had ten minutes left until their scheduled meeting.

Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling of worry. He was concerned that Stella might not find her way and anxious that she could face an accident on her way here. Most of all, he feared that Stella would decide not to come because she disliked him.

Regret washed over Lu Mingxu; he wished he hadn’t promised Stella not to go to school. If he hadn’t, he could have driven to pick her up and seen her sooner. He even regretted leaving the hospital after she had fallen asleep the night before.

Ever since meeting Stella, Lu Mingxu wanted to be with her all the time. Ideally, he wished for a way to tie them together with a rope so they would never have to part again. He had never experienced such anxiety over a relationship before. Was true love meant to be this sweet yet torturous?

The wait for his beloved always felt unbearable, as if every minute stretched into an hour. Lu Mingxu pulled out a pack of cigarettes, thinking about smoking to ease his anxiety, but remembering that Stella would soon enter the room, he restrained himself and put the pack back in his pocket. 

He never cared about such things when he was with his past girlfriends.

Stella arrived two minutes early, and the moment Lu Mingxu spotted her, all his negative feelings vanished. He stood up and walked over to her, gentlemanly pulling out the chair at the dining table.

“Thank you.”  
Stella expressed her gratitude, feeling that aside from her father, this was the first time a guy had treated her so kindly.

“No need to thank me.”  
Lu Mingxu smiled, flashing a bright, charming grin.

After Stella sat down, instead of returning to his own seat, he sat right next to her, causing her to awkwardly shift a little further away. 

In the cozy private room, the two sat across from each other at a round table, one smiling warmly while the other remained silent.

Stella, wanting to avoid Lu Mingxu’s intense gaze, focused her eyes on a landscape painting hanging on the wall. Just as he was about to call the waiter to order, she remembered the purpose of her visit here and interrupted, “No need, I’m here to pay back my debt. Once that’s done, I’ll leave.”

“Hmm, we can discuss the money later. Let’s eat first. The other aspects of this place might be lacking, but their medicinal cuisine is excellent and good for your legs,” Lu Mingxu suggested with a smile.

“No thanks. My legs are feeling much better now; I just want to settle the debt.” Stella insisted stubbornly.

Lu Mingxu felt helpless. “Look, the money is already enough. I invited you here to apologize for my rudeness the other day.”

“It’s alright; let’s just forget about that day. I didn’t suffer any harm, and since the money is sufficient, I’ll be on my way.”

After saying that, Stella attempted to get up to leave. However, as she stood, Lu Mingxu grabbed her arm.

“What are you doing?”  
Stella tensed up, memories of that night flooding back, and she instinctively tried to pull her arm away. 

Unlike that night, this time, Stella was able to easily free herself with a little force. Once liberated, she turned to leave.

But then she heard Lu Mingxu’s voice behind her.  
“The dinner yesterday cost a total of 39,999 yuan, so you still owe me 38,999 yuan.”

Stella froze in disbelief, spinning around to face him, “Why is it so expensive?!”

Lu Mingxu leaned back, arms crossed, looking at her with amusement, “The medicinal cuisine you had yesterday was prepared by this hotel. If you don’t believe me, feel free to ask any staff member here about the price.”

Trying to distance himself?  
Looks like you’re out of luck now~

With a smirk, Lu Mingxu observed the shocked expression on Stella’s face. He wasn’t lying; while the Jinghai Hotel may not match other five-star hotels in terms of facilities and service quality, it was renowned for its medicinal cuisine. 

The hotel’s owner, Old Master Xu, had ancestors who were specialized imperial chefs in medicinal cuisine, and the family recipe had built the hotel’s wealth. 

The most expensive dish Stella had the previous day was the fish maw braised beef, priced at 29,999 yuan. The fish maw used was premium quality wild red chicken mouth fish maw, which is known for its restorative properties. A pound of it costs tens of thousands of yuan.

For that dish, they wouldn’t need an entire pound of fish maw, as the weight and volume would increase significantly after soaking. One pound could yield between three to five pounds after soaking, so using around 50 grams for a dish was sufficient; otherwise, the price would be even higher. 

Stella wanted to scream in disbelief!  
The price of just that one dish was higher than her entire year’s worth of living expenses!

She wanted to blame Lu Mingxu for buying such an expensive meal for her. But thinking about his status, it was likely that to him, this medicinal cuisine was probably just like plain porridge is to ordinary folks.

“Can we sit down and talk now?”  
Lu Mingxu asked, seeing Stella’s face grow paler by the second. He felt a pang of sympathy for her. Yet, if he didn’t act, the woman in front of him would be eager to cut ties with him, as if he were some contagious virus.

There was no way he was letting Stella get away that easily!

**[Stella, don’t give him the satisfaction! Hit him with your cash!]**  
The system seethed, disapproving of Lu Mingxu's smug demeanor.

“Then I’ll pay through WeChat.”  
Stella tried to appear calm in front of Lu Mingxu, but inside, she felt like rolling around in agony.

Debts had to be repaid.  
But just as she’d finally gotten her hands on 100,000 yuan, she was now spending nearly half of it on food, which felt utterly unworthy. 

The jewelry she bought for 100,000 yuan could be worn and admired. But spending almost 40,000 yuan on food, which would ultimately just become part of her bodily cycle, felt like a waste.

Oh, she remembered, it was medicinal cuisine.  
So, she could only hope the medicinal properties of the food would help her legs heal quickly; they still hurt a bit when she walked.

“...What?”  
Upon hearing Stella’s response, Lu Mingxu, who had been so confident just a moment ago, suddenly felt uneasy.

……

In a private room at the “Starshine” bar, Lu Mingxu, slightly tipsy, held a bottle of whiskey, his gaze fixated on his phone as if he wanted to burn a hole through the screen.

He occupied an entire couch by himself, while others in the room were either grinding against their partners or flirting cheek-to-cheek, or playing silly drinking games, painting a picture of a group of wealthy young men living it up without a care in the world.

“Lu Shao, what are you looking at? Waiting for your girlfriend’s call?”  
Liang Yang leaned over, curious.

What’s with this serious demeanor? 

“Yeah, waiting for a call that will never come.”  
Lu Mingxu chuckled self-deprecatingly and gulped down more whiskey.

“Did you have a fight with her?” Liang Yang inquired.

“A fight? She just avoids me and won’t see me.”  
Lu Mingxu took another swig.

“Wait, are you two broken up?” Liang Yang asked, surprised.

“Broken up?”  
Lu Mingxu scoffed, “It would be better if we had! At least we would have been together! I haven’t even seen her smile once; am I that bothersome?”

Liang Yang was dumbfounded. It sounded like Lu Shao had been dumped by that ordinary-looking girl! 

But wait!  
Lu Shao’s words implied they had never even been together!

This wasn’t right!  
The charming girl shouldn’t have let go of Lu Shao while he was still interested in her!

Wasn't the strategy of ‘wanting what you can’t have’ supposed to work the other way around?

At that moment, Lu Mingxu suddenly threw down his whiskey bottle and grabbed Liang Yang by the collar, “Yangzi, am I really that unlikable?”

You are quite unlikable!  
But when you give benefits to those around you, you’re quite popular, like the foolish son of the local landlord who keeps losing money.

Liang Yang grumbled in his mind but said aloud, “Impossible! Which woman sees you and doesn’t want to cling to you like a leech?”

“But she doesn’t!”  
Lu Mingxu shot Liang Yang a glare, reprimanding him, “Can’t you use a better metaphor? What’s with the leech?”

“Uh, Lu Shao, you know my academic performance isn’t great. My literary skills are lacking, and my university degree was bought with my dad’s money. Please bear with me.”  
Liang Yang pleaded, while in his heart, he thought his description was quite apt.

Those women were all after Lu Shao’s money, right?  
They wanted to leech off him, to suck him dry! 

Some might even be after his looks, as Lu Shao was quite charming, and some women would rather have him than money!

China is vast and rich; there are many wealthy women.  
If Lu Shao didn’t have money, he could definitely make a living with his looks!

“Yangzi, what do you think love really is?”  
Lu Mingxu slumped back on the couch, questioning Liang Yang, who stood beside him.

What’s with the sudden philosophical questioning?  
Liang Yang thought for a moment before sharing his own thoughts on love: “Love is like my relationship with Xue Zhu. We’re in love!”

“Bullshit!”  
As soon as Liang Yang finished, Lu Mingxu shot back with disdain.

“Lu Shao, what do you mean by that?”  
Liang Yang felt a bit offended.

Lu Mingxu shrugged nonchalantly, “Yangzi, have you forgotten how you met Zhao Xue Zhu?”

A woman who actively joined their gathering couldn’t possibly have a genuine relationship with Liang Yang!  
Don’t tarnish the word!

“...True! My first meeting with her wasn’t exactly honorable, but since then, she’s been the only woman for me, and I for her. We’re in a real relationship now, heading towards marriage!”  
Liang Yang stubbornly defended himself.

“Ha!”  
Lu Mingxu scoffed again, continuing, “You two will break up sooner or later; you won’t get married.”

Every time he ran into Zhao Xue Zhu at gatherings, she would purposely flirt with him, shooting him glances, which made Lu Mingxu realize she didn’t take Liang Yang seriously at all. 

But he was surprised to learn that they had been dating for two years. 
Did Liang Yang just not see her flirty behavior, or did he willingly wear the green hat?

Two years isn’t that long; there are couples that break up after ten years!  
Maybe he should give a little hint, so they could break up sooner and Liang Yang could relieve himself of that green hat?

Lu Mingxu never imagined he would be looking out for Liang Yang while giving him advice, but Liang Yang didn’t appreciate it, as if Lu Mingxu had touched a nerve, and he shot back, “Lu Shao, don’t think about me and Xue Zhu; you can’t make it work with that girl either!”

“What do you mean by that?”  
Lu Mingxu shot Liang Yang a dangerous glare, thinking this kid had gotten too bold!

Liang Yang felt a shiver run through him from Lu Mingxu’s dangerous gaze, but he couldn’t hold back his frustration and blurted out what he had heard from others behind Lu Mingxu’s back regarding Zhao Xue Zhu’s thoughts.

Of course, he didn’t mention that Zhao Xue Zhu had said it. 

“Damn you!”  
Hearing Liang Yang's remarks about Stella, Lu Mingxu jumped up from the couch and landed a left hook to Liang Yang’s right cheek, knocking the hefty man to the ground.
