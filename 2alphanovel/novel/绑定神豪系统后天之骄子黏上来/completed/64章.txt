**Crazy Spending**

Three plastic surgeons analyzed the facial features of Xu Shujun and her companions, ultimately concluding that Xu Shujun, Song Mengmeng, Park Hanen, and Feng Xiaocong all needed double eyelid surgery. Among them, Xu Shujun and Park Hanen should also consider a nose job, opting for a non-invasive injection to enhance their noses. Additionally, all four of them should get some facial injections to correct minor imperfections.

On the other hand, Yang Yuxiu, Faliha, and Cheng Luyi were naturally endowed with double eyelids and didn’t require surgery; their noses were fine as well. They only needed some injections to improve their facial features.

Dr. Jin, renowned for his expertise in wrinkle removal and dermal fillers, pointed out that the hollows in Yang Yuxiu's cheeks didn’t need to be filled. He explained that the hollowness was not a natural trait but rather a result of her being underweight, suggesting she should find ways to gain some weight.

Upon hearing this, Stella Ling and the other members of the girl group looked over at Yang Yuxiu, noticing that not only her face, but her entire figure was strikingly slim. It was indeed time for her to put on a few pounds.

Afterward, Stella Ling made appointments for herself and the girl group members for full-body whitening and hair removal treatments at the plastic surgery clinic. Once all the procedures were confirmed, she planned to use the company's main account to pay for the surgeries.

Spending money on plastic surgery for the company's artists was justifiable as it counted as an investment in the business. However, for her personal beauty treatments, she would need to use funds from her personal account.

At this moment, Stella Ling suddenly heard the sound of a task being released by the Celestial Fortune System.

【Today's daily task: Spend 100,000 yuan within 30 minutes!】
【Weekly task: Spend 35 million yuan within 10 hours!】

Stella Ling was momentarily taken aback as she glanced at the three plastic surgeons and asked, "Do you offer membership cards at your hospital?"

After completing a random task the day before, Stella had drawn a physical reward— a 1-day time extension card. This card allowed her to extend the time for tasks, skills, and special items after claiming it. She had already received the card but hadn’t used it yet, knowing it wouldn’t take effect immediately. She intended to save it for now.

Moreover, she didn’t plan to use it for today’s weekly task; she figured she had plenty of time to spend 35 million yuan in just 10 hours.

"Yes, Miss Ling, would you like to apply for a membership card?" Dr. Jin inquired.

"Yes," Stella nodded.

Ten minutes later, the three plastic surgeons stared at Stella Ling in shock. This young lady had managed to secure a membership card with a limit of 1.96368 billion han yuan across their three clinics! That was equivalent to 10 million RMB in Chinese currency, amounting to a total of 30 million RMB across three cards!

"My goodness!" Dr. Jin couldn't help but place a hand over his heart, feeling as though his heart might leap out of his chest.

Just yesterday, Stella had gifted him luxury items worth half a year’s salary. Although plastic surgeons in Han Country earned well, as the director of a plastic surgery clinic, Dr. Jin's annual salary was only around 600 million han yuan, equivalent to 3 million RMB. While clinic directors often earned more, most of their additional income was reinvested into the clinic.

Stella Ling's extravagant spending had suddenly sparked thoughts in the minds of the three doctors about pursuing opportunities in Hua Country.

With 5.1 million yuan left to spend on the task, Stella Ling transferred this amount to the company's main account, just like the leftover 20 million from the random task a couple of days ago.

After completing the weekly task, Stella received a system lottery chance. She clicked to spin the wheel, which finally landed on the physical reward area—a 5-minute usage right for an American Express Black Card.

Stella's eyes lit up as she told the three plastic surgeons, "Let’s schedule the surgeries for tomorrow. I just remembered I have some other matters to attend to."

"Of course!" Dr. Jin immediately agreed, and the other two surgeons nodded in unison, eager to comply with the wishes of such a valuable client.

The American Express Black Card had spending limits in Hua Country, but not in Han Country! If Stella used the 1-day time extension card on the 5-minute usage right of the Black Card, she'd have a full day to use it!

As long as she shopped quickly, spending 1 billion RMB in a day would be entirely feasible! Plus, she could even buy properties in Han Country!

Thinking of this, Stella searched online for the procedures required to purchase property in Han Country. Soon enough, she felt disappointed and abandoned the idea. To buy property, one needed a criminal record clearance certificate.

Stella naturally had no criminal record, but the certificate had to be obtained from the public security bureau in Hua Country and would take 1 to 3 days to process. By then, the usage limit of the American Express Black Card would have long expired, so she decided to forget about buying real estate here.

Xu Shujun and the others were somewhat bewildered. Where exactly was Stella planning to take them?

Stella arrived at Han Country's only seven-star hotel—Signiel Seoul. Upon entering, she presented the American Express Black Card with the 1-day usage right and called for the hotel manager to assist her.

While the card had limits in Hua Country, it was highly regarded in many other developed nations. The Black Card granted access to top-tier privileges, bespoke services, and unparalleled global rights, including 24/7 concierge services, VIP seating at global events, and exclusive privileges at high-end private clubs.

Holding the Black Card meant having the world cater to you; if the cardholder wanted to travel the world, American Express would do everything possible to accommodate their requests.

Before long, the hotel manager hurried over to personally attend to Stella Ling. Upon learning that she was a client from Hua Country, he immediately switched to speaking in her language.

"Miss Ling, how may I assist you today?" the hotel manager inquired respectfully.

"I’d like to rent three luxurious presidential suites here for five years," Stella stated.

"Certainly, I’ll take care of that for you right away!" the manager said, bowing deeply.

When it came time to pay, Stella didn’t even glance at the amount, simply swiping the Black Card. During the card's usage period, her purchases in Han Country were essentially free; she didn’t need to know how much she was spending.

After completing the payment, Stella turned to Xu Shujun and the others and said, "We won’t be staying at the previous hotel; we’re moving here tonight."

With their boss saying so, Xu Shujun and the others naturally nodded in agreement. In truth, they were all utterly flabbergasted.

While they could somewhat understand Stella obtaining a membership card worth 30 million at the plastic surgery clinic, as the company would surely recruit many artists in the future, they still couldn’t grasp why she would rent such a luxurious hotel suite in Han Country, one even more extravagant than what they had in Hua Country!

And to rent it for five years—how much would that cost?!

Stella Ling felt a twinge of frustration as well; she didn’t want to spend so much money abroad, but the limitations of the American Express Black Card in Hua Country left her with no choice.

After securing the three luxurious presidential suites, Stella took Xu Shujun and the others to a luxury goods store.

With her Black Card in hand, the manager of the luxury shop practically catered to her and her companions the entire time.

"Pack up all the clothes, bags, shoes, and accessories suitable for me and my friends, and ship them to Hua Country. And make it quick," Stella instructed, experiencing her first bout of extravagant shopping—especially abroad.

Not taking full advantage of the Black Card would be a waste of the opportunity given by the Celestial Fortune System!

As a star artist, she needed to invest in her image, and this was the perfect chance to provide Xu Shujun and the others with the outfits they needed for their debut.

"Of course! I’ll take care of that immediately!" the luxury store manager replied, bowing respectfully.

Subsequently, Stella led Xu Shujun and the others through multiple luxury stores, leaving them so shocked they didn’t know where to put their hands and feet.

With the amount Stella was investing in them, once they debuted, could they really earn back that money for the company?

Park Hanen’s perceptions had been completely shattered. She used to think that entertainment companies in Han Country spent a lot on nurturing idols, but compared to Stella's actions today, it was like comparing a small mosquito to a giant whale!

In fact, artists in various countries typically received sponsorship from brands for the clothes and accessories they wore, needing to return them after photo shoots. Yet, Stella had outright purchased everything!

Stella seemed to be running the entertainment company just for fun, right? Could the company really recoup all this investment in the future?

If you asked Stella Ling, she would say she was uncertain as well. Given the speed and amount of money the Celestial Fortune System provided her, she might forever spend more than she earned.

Once the task funds increased, she planned to invest in a few good companies in Hua Country, which would help expand her personal account balance.

If it weren’t for the fact that credit cards couldn’t buy stocks, Stella would have definitely used the Black Card to purchase shares in some major Han companies.

By the evening, Stella returned Xu Shujun and the others to the Signiel Seoul hotel after their lengthy shopping spree and headed off to a luxury jewelry store in Han Country.

Stella intended to buy jewelry—lots of high-end jewelry. The reasons for her buying so much were twofold: first, because she loved it and it had collectible value; second, for her artists.

Once Xu Shujun and her companions debuted, they would undoubtedly participate in numerous grand events. She planned to lend them these high-priced, luxurious jewels to ensure her artists would shine at every occasion.

Stella had researched online and learned that brands would lend different levels of jewelry and clothing to stars attending high-profile events based on their status. But she didn’t want to rely on that; she wanted to buy the best and most expensive luxury items for her artists to wear at these events, ensuring they were the brightest stars on stage!

She first visited Han Country’s largest BVLGARI store, purchasing all the high-end jewelry and signature pieces, leaving the store manager grinning from ear to ear.

Next, she headed to Harry Winston, repeating the same process. She continued on to Gem Cages, Buccellati, GRAFF, the Grandma Xiang Jewelry Store, Chopard, David Morris, and other jewelry shops.

Even if some stores had already closed, Stella could call American Express customer service to have them open for her.

This was the “24/7 concierge service” provided by the American Express Black Card.

Stella bought so many expensive luxury items that, to prevent potential kidnapping of Black Card holders, American Express dispatched numerous bodyguards and luxury vehicles for her full protection.

During her stay in Han Country, these bodyguards would ensure her safety.

Stella found it fascinating that American Express indeed had records of her invitation to acquire the card; her client profile indicated she was the sole heir of a highly mysterious Li family with American connections. Only American Express and a few top-tier families in the world had a slight understanding of the family's background.

Stella’s mother’s last name was Li.

The Celestial Fortune System was truly impressive!

Finally, under the watchful eyes of her bodyguards, Stella went to a 4S dealership in Han Country, ordering several luxury cars to be shipped back to Rongcheng, Sichuan Province in Hua Country.

That night, Stella had thoroughly explored almost every luxury store in Han Country that had no records of insulting Hua Country. Their sales figures shattered previous records, leaving the managers of these stores beaming with joy.

By the time dawn broke the next day, Stella was utterly exhausted. But she didn’t want to waste the time allowed by the Black Card, so despite her fatigue, she called Xu Shujun and the others to wake them up and arranged for them to visit luxury stores for tailored haute couture fittings.

High-end fashion houses, particularly brand-name ones, often had client thresholds; not everyone could order custom pieces. Some individuals with billions might still not meet the requirements for these exclusive shops.

However, those holding a Black Card were exceptions.

For high-end fashion boutiques, the American Express Black Card symbolized the highest status.

Xu Shujun and the others found themselves surrounded by a group of staff from the haute couture shops, who were measuring them with soft tape measures.

Stella leaned back on the sofa, dozing off, while the staff proceeded with their work, not daring to express frustration at her lack of cooperation as they meticulously measured the girls’ dimensions.

After exiting the haute couture shop, Stella, accompanied by her bodyguards, made her way to Han Country's Han Yang Gymnasium and signed a 5-year leasing agreement.

This leasing agreement didn’t imply that the gym would be exclusively for Stella's use for five years; after all, this gym was the main venue for idol performances under various entertainment companies in Han Country. When it was built, multiple entertainment companies had contributed funds, so it couldn’t be leased entirely to one company.

During the 5-year lease period, Stella would be able to use the gym three times a month for performances, which would ensure she received the highest level of service given her status as a significant client.
