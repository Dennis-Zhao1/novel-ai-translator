### The Grand Finale

Due to the Beidou Girl Group's imitation of the series of videos filmed by Li Ziqi from a parallel universe, they had built a certain fanbase in the West. However, these fans were primarily drawn to the Seven Fairies videos. When it came to the stage performances uploaded by Xingchen Entertainment on YouTube, most Western fans found them lackluster.

There were two main reasons for this. 

First, they couldn't understand the lyrics, which prevented them from fully appreciating the beauty of the songs. 

Second, they still preferred Western music styles. 

After Stella Ling rented a venue commonly used by local artists for concerts, she began selling tickets online for the Beidou Girl Group’s concert. As expected, the audience on the day of the concert was predominantly Asian faces—Chinese expatriates who had come from their homeland to support their idols.

This time, the Beidou Girl Group didn’t start with their usual stage performance but opened with Song Mengmeng singing a Mongolian song solo. The Western audience had a penchant for heavy metal and rock but also appreciated Mongolian music, especially throat singing. 

Song Mengmeng began with a throat singing piece played on the morin khuur, followed by the well-loved Mongolian song "Hongyan" from the parallel universe. The song resonated deeply with the audience, and the other members of the girl group provided lively traditional Mongolian dance as accompaniment.

Once the performance of the culturally rich song concluded, the group shifted to Western songs from the parallel universe, singing and dancing with enthusiasm. They kicked things off with "Love Story," a catchy country-pop tune, followed by the blockbuster hit "Baby." Finally, they delivered an emotional rendition of "Auld Lang Syne." Instead of dancing, they sat on stools set up on stage, facing the audience, pouring their hearts into the performance and moving many in the audience to tears.

Naturally, this stage performance was a resounding success. The wildly popular Western songs from the parallel universe earned the Beidou Girl Group a significant number of new fans in the West, while those who had been their supporters before became devoted followers.

As Stella Ling continued to introduce more Western songs, the Beidou Girl Group grew increasingly popular abroad. Xingchen Entertainment even organized a project in the U.S. to film a sensational version of "Twilight," with the lead role played by the talented Farisha, who had an impressive acting score of 9.5. 

Though Farisha was Chinese, she was of Uyghur descent, giving her a unique look that resembled a blend of East and West, making her universally appealing to audiences from various countries. The other girl group members took on smaller roles in the film, but Stella Ling had already prepared tailor-made movie roles for them, ensuring they would also shine as leading characters in the future.

Once "Twilight" premiered, the Beidou Girl Group naturally attracted a huge following of young fans from all around the world, skyrocketing their popularity to new heights. 

As Xingchen Entertainment continued to make strides into Hollywood, their rapid success sparked jealousy among American entertainment companies. However, no matter how they tried to manipulate public opinion or employ underhanded tactics to block their progress, Xingchen Entertainment consistently launched new hit songs and films, rendering their schemes ineffective.

In addition to her work with Xingchen Entertainment, Stella Ling began establishing other companies. The various cosmetic formulas and instant meal recipes she had won through the system's lottery were put into production, with the Beidou Girl Group serving as the spokespersons. As soon as these products hit the market, they sold like hotcakes.

The most crucial aspect was that the formulas Stella had obtained were genuinely high-quality, leading to ever-increasing sales. The investments she had made in the entertainment company finally started to pay off. 

As Stella completed more tasks, the rewards she received from the lottery became increasingly high-end, expanding her enterprises across various industries, including but not limited to automotive, mobile technology, and healthcare. 

Once she started raking in more money than she could spend, Stella became actively involved in various charitable endeavors. Whatever project the country needed funding for, she contributed to, leading major state media outlets to praise her online, leaving Stella feeling somewhat bashful.

Now, Stella Ling no longer feared the pursuits of any so-called Heaven's Chosen Ones. Her worth had surpassed that of their parents, and she was highly regarded by the government, making it impossible for them to approach her, let alone pursue her. As long as Stella made it clear she wasn’t interested, there were plenty of people willing to help block those elite pursuits.

The once humble Xingchen Entertainment had now evolved into the Xingchen Group. As the chairwoman of the group, countless rumors about Stella circulated online. Some claimed she was the beloved daughter of a prominent figure in the government. Others suggested she was the last descendant of a hidden Chinese family abroad, returning to her homeland at the behest of her ancestors.

The most outlandish rumor claimed she was the fabled "Purple Star" descended from the heavens. This rumor began circulating in 2021, suggesting that before 2023, a "Purple Star" would emerge in the entertainment industry, becoming a true international superstar. 

Initially, this claim was met with ridicule, as many believed the Purple Star was a political figure with no place in the entertainment world. However, once it became associated with Stella Ling, skepticism turned into curiosity. After all, Stella was now the world's richest person, had risen through the entertainment industry, and was actively assisting her country with various challenges.

The most telling detail was that she had founded her first girl group, named Beidou. It was well-known that the Big Dipper (Beidou) was constantly revolving around the brightest Purple Star. 

When Stella saw these claims, she only smiled. She didn’t consider herself a Purple Star. Instead, she believed that anyone helped by the forces of fortune could become this so-called "Purple Star." 

Stella felt the Purple Star represented self-awareness, with dignity and self-reliance being the true essence of awakening. She believed that the Purple Star symbolized not just one person but a collective of awakened souls. After all, one person alone could not change the world; only through the strength of many could the world become a better place.

Standing on a peak in Mianzhu, stroking her now much larger three-colored cat, Stella softly said, “Fortune, I have a feeling that today I must leave this place.”

“... Your intuition is spot on. Your earthly ties have ended; it is indeed time to return.” 

Fortune paused, then spoke.

In the next moment, the sky suddenly erupted with a brilliant flash of light, and Stella Ling, standing atop the peak, vanished without a trace.

When she opened her eyes again, all her memories had returned. It turned out she was not human at all, but a deity from the divine realm, governing the fortunes of happiness, wealth, longevity, and joy! 

To ascend to a higher divine status, she had reincarnated as a mortal to undergo trials. After successfully passing the trials, her divine status was supposed to elevate from true god to heavenly god. However, due to an error in the underworld, the deity of fortune was unable to return to her divine position, and instead, she was reincarnated as a mortal named Stella Ling.

Since this was a mistake, the deity of fortune was allowed to have her attendant, Fortune, descend as the Celestial Fortune System to protect her. Thus, Fortune was not from the 888 Star Cloud system but a true deity from the divine realm, her loyal attendant.

At this moment, the returning deity of fortune suddenly recalled that those Heaven's Chosen Ones chasing after her in the mortal realm were also deities from the heavenly realm. They had come down alongside her to gather divine fortunes to help them ascend to higher divine ranks. 

Since they hadn’t succeeded in their quest in the mortal world, they would certainly return to the heavenly realm and continue to pursue her. 

Before they could return to their positions, it would be best for her to take a trip to another world and hide for a while to avoid being tangled up with them again. 

With that thought, the deity of fortune tore through the void with a wave of her hand and flew off to another world to enjoy her freedom.
