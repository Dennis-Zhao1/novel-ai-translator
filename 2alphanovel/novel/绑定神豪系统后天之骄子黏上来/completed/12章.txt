Falling Down

Stella Ling never imagined that the other party would actually chase after her in a car!

Although she wasn't a car enthusiast, just looking at its sleek exterior, she could tell it was a high-quality luxury vehicle, definitely faster than the average car. As it drove alongside her, Stella didn’t even hear any noise from the engine.

No matter how fast her sprinting skills were, they couldn't compare to the four tires of a car.

Stella stopped in her tracks, forcing herself to remain calm as she stared at the man inside the vehicle, who wore a smile on his face. In a hoarse voice, she demanded, "What do you want?"

Lu Mingxu also halted the car, his gaze fixed on Stella’s face from the driver’s seat. 

Today, in her rush to complete a task, Stella had left her dorm without even washing her face. Though there was nothing particularly unsightly about her appearance, her eyes were red and puffy from crying yesterday. Combined with the exertion from her running, her complexion was pale, making her look quite exhausted.

At that moment, despite her disheveled appearance, Stella struck Lu Mingxu as both pitiful and adorable, softening his heart completely.

Lu Mingxu could never have anticipated that he would experience love at first sight. He had always been skeptical about such a notion, believing it to be merely an excuse for lust at first glance. Yet, just yesterday, his perception had been completely overturned.

Love at first sight wasn’t about falling for someone’s looks. It was about a soul connection!

When Lu Mingxu first laid eyes on Stella, he didn’t think she was particularly beautiful—she wasn’t even cute by most standards. Yet, she had captivated his attention entirely, his eyes drawn to her as if by an invisible force. 

And when their gazes met, he felt a stirring from deep within his soul.

For the first time in his 26 years of life, Lu Mingxu found himself yearning for love.

As he watched a bottle of chilled mineral water inch closer, almost touching her eyes, Stella flinched from the cold and stumbled back a few steps. 

"What do you want from me?!"

Stella was enraged by Lu Mingxu's inexplicable behavior, her entire demeanor becoming more guarded.

Seeing her react like an agitated kitten, glaring at him with suspicion, Lu Mingxu felt a twinge of regret. He realized he had completely botched their first encounter. 

If only he hadn’t been drinking yesterday, things could have gone differently. But there were no "if onlys." In his drunken state, he had acted impulsively, driven by his emotions. 

When he discovered someone intended to harm her, he had reacted with protective rage. Unfortunately, Stella couldn’t understand his intentions at that moment; all she felt was offense and even a threat to her safety.

"Why don’t you put some ice water on your eyes? You just finished running and shouldn’t drink it cold. Wait until it warms up a bit before you drink," Lu Mingxu offered, maintaining his gesture of handing her the water. When Stella refused to take it, he raised an eyebrow and teased, "Or do you want me to get out and help you apply it?"

Stella completely ignored his teasing, shooting him a glare before turning and continuing her run toward the dorm.

There was no way she was going to take that bottle of water; she was afraid that the jerk Lu Mingxu had poisoned it!

Let him follow her in his car; it’s not like he could drive into the dormitory anyway.

To Lu Mingxu's surprise, Stella didn’t take the bait. Realizing just how resistant she was to him, he chuckled bitterly to himself and continued to drive behind her.

It seemed misfortune was piling up one after another.

When Stella reached the vicinity of a small supermarket, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her calf and fell to the ground.

Her shampoo, toothpaste, and toothbrush tumbled from her shopping bag, scattering everywhere. Even the new fruits she had just bought didn’t escape the same fate.

Stella lay on the ground, wincing in pain as she reached for her phone. Luckily, she had splurged on a tough case for it, or her new phone would have been damaged on its very first day of use.

After checking her phone, she wanted to grab the shampoo, but her leg hurt too much, and the shampoo had rolled too far away for her to reach.

In that moment, a wave of grievance washed over Stella. She didn’t want to feel sorry for herself, but she felt like a stray dog, chased with no escape. Had she done something wrong? Why was she experiencing this?

Before she could ponder further, Stella was suddenly lifted off the ground.

The world spun around her, finally coming to a halt as she found herself face-to-face with Lu Mingxu’s handsome face.

Seeing the tears streaming down Stella’s cheeks, Lu Mingxu hurriedly asked, "Did you hurt yourself?"

Without waiting for a response, he scooped her up and headed back toward his car.

The small supermarket was bustling with people, and many had noticed the commotion surrounding Stella.

"Who is that? Aren't cars not allowed near the dorms?" one guy, who had just exited the store with his friends, puzzled as he spotted the imposing black car slowly approaching.

"Oh my god! It’s a Rolls Royce Ghost! I can't believe I’m seeing one in 2022!" exclaimed one of his companions, recognizing the luxury vehicle with astonishment.

"What? Is it really that expensive?" another friend asked curiously.

"Are you kidding me? Is there such a thing as a cheap Rolls Royce?" the first boy rolled his eyes dramatically.

"Sure, there are plenty of luxury cars around campus, but I've never seen you drooling over them like this," another chimed in.

"That’s because this is the 2023 model Rolls Royce Ghost, and it hasn’t even been officially released yet! I’ve only seen it in pre-sale videos online. You think the owner is some big shot to have gotten their hands on it early?" 

"Wow! That’s impressive! No wonder you’re so excited!"

"Which dorm is this person from? Wait, aren’t all the dorms around here for girls?"

"Is it a female boss or a pampered girlfriend?" 

At this point, the guy who recognized the car chuckled a bit lewdly.

"I can't believe that girl fell flat on her face! This is hilarious!"

"What's so funny about it? Have some compassion!"

As they spoke, another boy from the group started to walk over, thinking that since beautiful girls were abundant at Jing City Foreign Language University, he might heroically save the damsel in distress and perhaps win a girlfriend in the process. 

But what if she turned out to be unattractive? Well, at least he’d be doing a good deed without expecting anything in return.

Just as he was about to approach, he saw a sturdy, handsome guy get out of the Rolls Royce Ghost and lift the fallen girl, carrying her back to the car.

The group, upon seeing the girl's appearance, expressed confusion.

"Am I mistaken? An average girl with a handsome guy?"

"Can’t you tell? Those two are clearly not a couple! The car owner is just being kind, helping a girl who fell."

"Help her up is one thing, but why carry her into the car? I bet they know each other!" 

"Could she be trying to scam him, pretending to be hurt to get a ride to the hospital, hoping to pin it on the car owner?"

"There's no way she’s that delusional, is there? There are so many average girls these days!"

"Since he’s carrying her, it looks like she’s hooked! This handsome guy must be easy to fool with his money!"

The boy who initially intended to help felt annoyed and defended Stella, saying, "I think she fell pretty hard. She didn’t look too happy being picked up, not like you think at all."

"No way! You seriously like her?" one of his friends teased.

"Who likes her? I’m just stating the facts!" he quickly retorted.

"Denial is just a form of affirmation! Facts are just realities!" 

Just as this group was immersed in their banter, the sleek black Rolls Royce Ghost silently glided past them.

"Wow! It really lives up to its name, Ghost! The engine is so quiet!" the boy who recognized the car exclaimed, excitement evident in his voice.
