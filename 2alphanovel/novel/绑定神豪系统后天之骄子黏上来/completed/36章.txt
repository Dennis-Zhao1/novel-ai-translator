Chapter 1: The Unexpected Encounter

The Celestial Fortune System nimbly retreated from the lakeside, glaring at the man watching it with bared teeth.

"Meow! Meow meow!"

What are you staring at? Haven't you seen such a cute little kitty before?

Zhong Shensheng regarded the three-colored kitten that was defiantly facing him a short distance away, amusement bubbling in his heart. How could there be such a plump, round little cat that looked like a baby pig? Was it raised by someone living nearby? 

No, it seemed to have run over from the direction of Meixiang Park. That park was about two kilometers away from here. So, it really was a cat, easily trotting all this way. How enviable!

Seeing that the man was still fixated on it, the system felt a surge of anger. But then it suddenly noticed the blue butterfly it had chased earlier had landed on the man’s wrist. 

More precisely, it was perched on the sandalwood bead bracelet adorning his wrist. The delicate butterfly, with its three pairs of slender legs, was firmly attached to one of the beads, its blue gradient wings completely still, as if it were meditating on Zen.

Once the system spotted the butterfly, it scampered over with delight. Fish can wait; I need to catch that butterfly first! 

...

Stella Ling jogged along the bluestone path for about five minutes before her concern for the system caused her to halt her exercise. She retraced her steps to the spot where she had last parted with the kitten and entered the bustling wintersweet grove.

As she walked, Stella called out for the system in her mind. “System, where are you?”

【I’m playing by the lake.】

“What lake? There’s no lake in Meixiang Park.”

Stella was currently checking the terrain map of Meixiang Park on her phone. There weren’t any lakes in the park, just a few artificial hills and ponds.

Zooming out the map, she discovered a lake just outside the wintersweet grove, surrounded by a residential area. However, that residential area was about 1.5 kilometers away from where she was. How did the system manage to wander so far off?

Stella asked, “Can you come back right away?”

【Sure, but there are people here. Wait a moment while I find a spot without anyone around or any cameras, then I’ll teleport to your bag.】

【Ah, someone is following me!】

“Then just stay there and don’t move. I’ll come to get you.”

Seeing that the system was in a tricky situation, Stella urged in her heart.

【Alright, I’ll play by the lake a little longer.】

After about ten minutes of walking, Stella suddenly spotted a “Stop” sign ahead in the wintersweet grove. It read: "Private Residential Area Ahead, Unauthorized Entry Prohibited."

Glancing at the sign, Stella decided to press on. For the sake of retrieving the system, she figured a little rule-breaking was acceptable. If it came down to it, she could apologize profusely to the security personnel there.

From now on, if the system wanted to roam elsewhere, she would definitely tag along. Otherwise, she would feel uneasy, like a child who had lost their way.

Ignoring the warning sign, Stella continued forward for about five more minutes, finally emerging from the wintersweet grove, her eyes wide with amazement at the sight before her.

What a beautiful scene!

Stella was utterly captivated by the picturesque lake. The water was bordered by vibrant flowers and lush grass, glimmering like gold under the morning sun. A group of colorful koi were frolicking in the lake, appearing leisurely and carefree.

She also noticed two elegant black swans by the water’s edge. With their petite heads, crimson beaks, and gracefully curved necks, they exuded an air of sophistication, their sleek black feathers impeccably arranged.

Stella watched as the two black swans retrieved feed from their bowls and dipped their beaks into the lake. At that moment, the plump koi swam up, their mouths open wide, as if waiting to be fed.

It looked as if the swans were feeding the koi, but Stella remembered her childhood visits to her grandmother’s house, where she had seen geese. She knew geese had a habit of soaking their feed in water. 

The two black swans were merely wetting the food to soften it, making it easier to swallow. So, the scene wasn’t one of affectionate feeding but rather a comedy where the greedy koi were attempting to snatch food from the swans.

The black swans seemed to be thinking, “This is so annoying!”

Stella continued to scan her surroundings, realizing this wasn’t just any residential area—it was a luxury villa neighborhood.

Suddenly, she heard two “meows,” and at the same moment, the system’s voice echoed in her mind.

【Xiao Xing, I’m over here!】

【That person was following me!】

Turning her gaze toward the sound, Stella first spotted not the system, but a young man seated in a wheelchair. 

He looked frail, yet his features were undoubtedly striking—no, they were exceptionally handsome, the kind of beauty that was both delicate and refined. 

Stella couldn’t help but feel a pang of pity for the man; he was in the prime of his life, yet his body...

Stop thinking like that!

Maybe he had only sustained a leg injury and was temporarily unable to walk, and he would soon recover.

Wait, where was the system?

Stella then realized the system was squatting beside the man’s wheelchair. The little cat was glaring at the man with an indignant expression. When it saw Stella approaching, it turned its head and meowed in complaint.

【Xiao Xing, this bad guy called me a piggy!】

Stella nearly burst out laughing at those words. She jogged over and scooped up the sulking kitten, apologizing to the man, “I’m so sorry for the interruption. I came here looking for this cat. I’ll leave right away.”

“What’s its name?” 

The man in the wheelchair suddenly asked, lifting his elegant eyes to fixate on Stella.

“Uh?” 

Stella was momentarily taken aback and quickly asked the system in her mind, “System, do you have a name?”

【No, just give me one to deal with this annoying guy! We need to leave here quickly!】

With the system’s frustrated voice echoing in her mind, Stella contemplated for a few seconds and replied to the man, “Its name is Zhao Cai.”

【That’s a nice name! It really suits me!】

The man paused for a moment, then arched his beautiful eyes in question, “Isn’t it called Little Fatty?”

【You’re the fat one! You horrible man, you said I scared the butterfly away because I’m too fat!】

“Not really.” 

Stella shook her head and added, “I’m sorry, but I have to go now.”

As she turned to leave back toward the wintersweet grove, the man, seeing her indifference, lowered his graceful gaze and glanced at his legs with evident disdain.

He placed his hand on the left armrest of his wheelchair and pressed a button above it. 

The wheelchair began to move, but instead of advancing toward Stella, it rolled backward. 

Behind him lay the serene, beautiful lake. 

With a sudden splash, water erupted into the air. 

Stella was startled by the sound and turned to see the shocking scene unfolding before her eyes.

He fell into the water!

Had the wheelchair malfunctioned? 

The man had tipped into the lake head-first, his entire head submerged. 

Unable to move his legs, he remained there, floating motionless in the water, appearing lifeless.

Panic surged within Stella as she dropped the system and rushed towards the lake, shouting for help. 

Once she reached the water, she waded toward him, the water level rising to her waist. 

If she hadn’t taken note of the lake’s depth, she wouldn’t have dared to jump in for a rescue today, especially since she couldn’t swim.
