**Jewelry Exhibition**

After watching the graduation program and taking graduation photos, Cheng Luyiyi, with the encouragement of her friend Li Miaomiao, finally faced her true feelings. 

Deep down, she had always yearned for the entertainment industry.

Every time she turned down a scout, she would secretly regret it for days. However, since entering her junior year, she hadn’t encountered any scouts trying to approach her. She thought her chances of breaking into the entertainment world were gone. 

But today, she unexpectedly received another invitation to join the industry—this time from the boss of an entertainment company. It was hard for her not to feel excited.

Once she finished taking her graduation photos, Ling Xiaoxing walked over and presented her with a bouquet of champagne roses, congratulating her on her graduation.

“Thank you,” Cheng Luyiyi replied, feeling a bit shy as she accepted the bouquet.

It was noon, and lunchtime had arrived. The two headed to a Cantonese restaurant near the school to eat and chat. 

After they sat down, Ling Xiaoxing opened the menu and asked Cheng Luyiyi what she wanted to eat, but the girl seemed a bit embarrassed and said she was fine with anything. 

So, Ling Xiaoxing ordered a plate of avocado vegetable salad, two servings of juicy crispy pigeon, Jiangnan preserved meat soup, flaming grilled lamb chops, and a premium seafood pot. For dessert and drinks, she chose passion fruit pudding and freshly squeezed watermelon juice.

Ling Xiaoxing took a sip of the sweet watermelon juice and bit into the fragrant grilled lamb chop, then began discussing the scale of Starry Entertainment, the benefits for artists, and the general details of the contract prepared for newcomers.

Aside from the fact that the company was located in Chengdu, which was not near her home, Cheng Luyiyi was basically satisfied with everything about Starry Entertainment. However, she still needed to get her parents' approval before signing a contract with an entertainment company.

Ling Xiaoxing understood this and exchanged WeChat contacts with Cheng Luyiyi, who promised to give her an answer the next day.

After finishing their meal and bidding farewell to Cheng Luyiyi, Ling Xiaoxing initially planned to leave Beijing City directly. However, she received an invitation from a jewelry sales assistant named Zhu, who had previously served her at the BVLGARI store in Taikoo Li, Beijing.

Zhu wanted to invite Ling Xiaoxing to visit a high-end jewelry exhibition at the BVLGARI Hotel in Beijing at 1 PM that afternoon. During the call, Zhu subtly hinted that if Ling Xiaoxing found any jewelry she liked at the exhibition, she could purchase it directly.

When it came to high-end jewelry, Ling Xiaoxing immediately thought of the two multi-million dollar jewelry sets she had bought at the Harry Winston store. With 30 million left in her bank account, she didn’t want to dip into it; most of the money in her company’s main account was task funding and couldn’t be freely used. How could she afford to buy jewelry now?

Just then, she received a notification: 

【Today’s daily task has been released: Spend 100,000 yuan within 30 minutes.】
【Random task triggered: Spend 20 million yuan within 6 hours.】

Well, lucky her, it seemed that her wealth was coming in just in time.

Deciding to check out the jewelry exhibition, Ling Xiaoxing took a taxi to the BVLGARI Hotel 20 minutes later, where Zhu was waiting for her outside the hotel.

Seeing Ling Xiaoxing getting out of the car, Zhu hurried over to greet her. However, upon noticing Ling Xiaoxing's casual attire, Zhu regretted inviting this VIP customer to the high-end jewelry exhibition.

Dressed in casual shorts and a short-sleeve shirt, despite it being a brand from the beloved designer Xie Nainai, it felt a bit too casual for a jewelry exhibition. After all, the first time she served this customer, she had been wearing high-end LV ready-to-wear. Why was she dressed so simply today?

What Zhu didn’t know was that Ling Xiaoxing was currently living in Chengdu, where the summer weather was scorching hot. If she didn’t wear something cooler, she wouldn’t even dare to step outside.

Zhu composed herself, put on a smile, and welcomed Ling Xiaoxing into the hotel.

The jewelry exhibition was on the top floor of the hotel. Once they reached the venue, Ling Xiaoxing followed Zhu inside.

As soon as she entered the exhibition, Ling Xiaoxing was dazzled by the opulent decorations and the more than three hundred pieces of high-end jewelry on display. She quickly took out her stylish oversized sunglasses from her bag, intending to scrutinize the various jewels on display.

Having already transferred today’s daily task reward into her company’s main account, she still had 20 million yuan left to spend.

Seeing Ling Xiaoxing wear the glasses and exude an air of confidence, Zhu was momentarily awestruck, mistaking her for the store manager. She felt she couldn’t afford to be careless and began to introduce the showcased jewelry seriously.

Ling Xiaoxing listened to the introductions while examining the price tags of the jewelry. Among the 357 pieces of high-end jewelry on display, the lowest-priced jewelry set was several million, while the most expensive one was priced at an astonishing 200 million!

Ling Xiaoxing felt a little embarrassed; although she loved jewelry, 200 million was simply too expensive!

Then she heard Zhu explain that the priciest piece was a necklace from BVLGARI released in 2015, with only one in the world, and it still hadn’t found its owner.

Of course, it wouldn’t! At such a high price, who would buy it?

Ling Xiaoxing couldn’t help but scoff inwardly.

After browsing around, Ling Xiaoxing’s attention was drawn to an exceptionally extravagant necklace.

Noticing that Ling Xiaoxing was fixated on the necklace, Zhu quickly explained, “Miss Ling, this necklace is from BVLGARI’s MAGNIFICA high-end jewelry collection, named the Mediterranean Queen. It features five oval cushion-cut Paraiba tourmalines, totaling approximately 473.82 carats, interlinked with diamond and emerald chain links, and it took a staggering 2400 hours to create.”

Looking at the five enormous sky-blue Paraiba tourmalines embedded in the necklace, Ling Xiaoxing thought to herself that she wouldn’t even dare to buy something so extravagant!

She felt that even if she bought it, wearing it would make her look like she was just playing dress-up with plastic Barbie toys. Such an extravagant necklace needed someone with elegance, experience, and perhaps someone older to pull off its luxurious beauty.

“Would you like to try it on?” Zhu asked, noticing Ling Xiaoxing’s intense gaze on the necklace.

“No, thank you,” Ling Xiaoxing shook her head. The necklace seemed too heavy; she didn’t want to wear something that would feel like it was pulling her neck down. 

With that thought, she glanced at the price tag of the necklace: 30.56 million yuan.

So expensive!

Ling Xiaoxing shifted her gaze from the giant candy-like necklace and began searching for her task target within the exhibition hall.

Ultimately, Ling Xiaoxing decided to purchase a piece worth 20 million yuan—the BVLGARI Magnifica Diamond Swan Necklace.

The necklace weighed approximately 20.08 carats and was designed in the shape of two swans in flight, with their heads adorned with pink diamond eyes, surrounded by diamond accents and occasional mother-of-pearl elements. The manufacturing process took a remarkable 2000 hours.

When Zhu learned that Ling Xiaoxing was buying a necklace worth 20 million, she was overjoyed and immediately assisted the customer with the purchasing process.

After Ling Xiaoxing completed the payment and received the necklace, she didn’t try it on; instead, she placed it directly into her handbag.

Concerned for the safety of such a valuable customer carrying a 20 million yuan necklace, BVLGARI sent a dedicated driver to take Ling Xiaoxing to the airport.

Once she boarded her flight, Ling Xiaoxing began to draw her rewards.

The needle spun and finally landed on the random skill area.

It was the Eye of Insight.

Just what she had wanted yesterday—the ability to assess a doctor’s skill level.
