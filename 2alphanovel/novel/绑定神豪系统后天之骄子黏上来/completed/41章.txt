**Ambition**

Someone has come out!

As Stella Ling spotted a group of girls walking out of a nearby office building, she immediately sprang up from her seat, grabbed her bag, and hurried out of the café.

The closer she got to the group, the clearer the potential scores floating above their heads became.

"6.3, 7.2, 6.5, 7.9, 8.3!"

Hu Dongdong was right; among the trainees practicing late into the night, there were indeed some promising talents.

But it wasn't enough.

The trainee she was looking for needed to have a potential score of at least 8.5.

Just as Stella started to feel a bit disappointed, a dazzling score caught her eye.

9.3!

Without hesitation, Stella bypassed the five girls who were walking together and jogged towards the one behind them.

This girl was walking slowly with her head down, and above her floated the score indicating she was a genius in the entertainment industry.

Feeling the light change from the shadow cast in front of her, Xu Shujun looked up, thinking someone was about to start trouble.

To her surprise, it was an unfamiliar young woman blocking her way.

“...Is there something I can help you with?” Xu Shujun asked, glancing at the woman in front of her.

“Hello, I’m Stella Ling, the president of Xingchen Entertainment. I’d like to discuss a collaboration with you, if you have some time?” Stella said, her smile masking the nervousness bubbling inside her.

This was the first time she had approached someone like this.

But everyone has to start somewhere.

After all, she was going to be a boss in the future; if she couldn’t even handle this, how could she manage a company!

“I... I’m already signed with a company,” Xu Shujun stammered.

Was she being approached by a talent scout?

No, the woman in front of her claimed to be the president of Xingchen Entertainment.

So, she was being scouted by the owner of an entertainment company?

Stella’s smile widened as she tried to cover her anxiety, saying, “I know. I’ve been following you for a long time. If you’re interested in joining Xingchen Entertainment, I can help you with the termination fee, and I’ll even pay it for you.”

Xu Shujun: “…”

Xu Shujun was stunned. She really was being noticed by the president of an entertainment company!

Not only was she personally invited, but Stella was also willing to pay her termination fee for free!

This was something Xu Shujun had never dared to dream of.

Even the company she was currently signed with had only accepted her after she applied and went through layers of selection. Before that, all she encountered were scammers trying to take her training fees; no real talent scout had ever approached her.

Clearly, the five girls ahead of her looked way more attractive than she did. Why would President Ling choose her over them?

The other woman had just said she had been watching her for a long time.

Xu Shujun's heart began to race, and just as she was about to say something, she noticed the five girls who had walked ahead suddenly turning back.

Among them, the tallest and most beautiful girl, Fang Yao, looked at Xu Shujun and asked, “Shujun, who is this? Aren’t you going to introduce us?”

Actually, Fang Yao had overheard their conversation and had deliberately brought them back.

This year, the children’s day announcement had called off all audition-style programs.

The large-scale audition show they had prepared for had ended before it even began, shattering the dreams of trainees who had been ready to debut.

Fang Yao didn’t know how she had made it through these days; she could only find faults in others to vent her frustration and resentment.

But why?

Why was it that at such a critical moment, the girl she always found annoying, Xu Shujun, was being offered a chance?

Was this woman blind? Couldn’t she see that she was far more beautiful and had better conditions than Xu Shujun?

And where did this Xingchen Entertainment come from? She had never heard of it.

Could this woman be a fraud?

As Fang Yao was about to mock Xu Shujun for meeting a scammer in her heart, she noticed the young woman claiming to be the president of Xingchen Entertainment was dressed to the nines, and any trace of her earlier sneer vanished.

Wearing all LV and adorned with sparkling jewelry on her ears, neck, wrists, and fingers, there was no doubt that this seemingly ordinary young woman was anything but ordinary.

This only fueled Fang Yao’s jealousy.

Why?

Why was Xu Shujun the one getting noticed?

Stella Ling could sense the hostility radiating from the beautiful girl beside her, but it seemed to be directed not at her.

If not at her, then it must be aimed at the girl with the 9.3 score?

Indeed, exceptional people attract jealousy.

After all, if you’re not envied, you’re mediocre!

At that moment, Stella felt a twinge of delight, but then she realized this feeling was rather malicious.

Her future company’s artist was being targeted; why would she feel happy about that…

“Sorry, we’re discussing something right now and would prefer not to be disturbed,” Stella said to the group of five girls led by Fang Yao. Then, she turned back to Xu Shujun and smiled, inviting her, “How about we find a nearby place to sit down and talk?”

With that, Stella fixed her gaze on Xu Shujun, not letting a single change in her expression slip by.

And she prayed internally.

Please don’t reject her! Otherwise, she would have just put on a show for nothing!

“Sure.”

Without much thought, Xu Shujun nodded in agreement.

This made Stella feel relieved and elated.

Feeling great, Stella took Xu Shujun to a nearby steamed seafood restaurant.

On the way, Stella learned Xu Shujun's name and, to show familiarity, dropped her last name: “Shujun, is it okay to eat seafood? It’s on me.”

“No, no, no, we don’t need to eat! We can just talk at the café next door!” Xu Shujun hurriedly waved her hands in panic.

“Well then…”

**[Ding! Today's daily mission: Spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!]**

**[Xiaoxing, I want to eat seafood!]**

Great, the finance system finally issued today's daily task.

Aside from yesterday's weekly task, the finance system had been sending her tasks every night for the last two days; she was becoming a night owl.

Stella had initially planned to respect Xu Shujun's wishes and discuss things at the café, but after hearing the system, she immediately changed her mind: “Let’s stick with seafood. You’ve been practicing so late; you should have something to eat. Plus, I want some too.”

“...Okay, thanks.”

Knowing Stella wanted to eat, Xu Shujun had no choice but to nod in agreement, a shy expression appearing on her face. “I’m really sorry for making you spend so much.”

“You don’t have to be so polite.”

With that, the two of them entered the seafood restaurant.

As soon as they walked in, Stella asked the waiter who approached them if they could get a membership card.

After learning they could, Stella immediately applied for one and topped it up with 10,000 yuan.

This operation left Xu Shujun wide-eyed.

She was really rich.

Xu Shujun thought to herself.

The two were led to their table by the waiter.

Stella skimmed through the menu and said to the waiter, “I’d like one four-pound king crab, one pound of shrimp, half a dozen abalone, and one pound of Dandong clams…”

Stella paused and looked at Xu Shujun across the table. “Shujun, what seafood do you like?”

“I... I’m fine with anything; just order what you want,” Xu Shujun replied quickly, still shocked by Stella's order of a four-pound king crab.

King crab! That’s so expensive!

Xu Shujun had only seen it being eaten by food vloggers online; this was her first time encountering it in real life.

“Okay then, let’s add a portion of garlic oysters, a portion of garlic vermicelli scallops, a portion of pepper beef, and for vegetables, let’s have a mix of baby bok choy,” Stella continued to order.

So much!

Xu Shujun was taken aback. Would they even be able to finish all this?

“I’d like Hong Kong-style iced lemon tea for my drink and mango sago for dessert.”

After finishing her order, Stella handed the menu to Xu Shujun and smiled, “You can pick the drinks and dessert; mine is done.”

“Oh, okay.”

Xu Shujun hurriedly accepted the menu with both hands.

When she saw the prices of the drinks and desserts written on the menu, she gasped. The prices here were much higher than outside.

That four-pound king crab was a whopping 2,000 yuan!

Feeling guilty, Xu Shujun initially planned to say she wouldn’t have a drink or dessert, but when she saw Stella looking at her with anticipation, she feared looking stingy, so she chose the cheapest drink, the iced salted lemon tea, and the cheapest dessert, osmanthus herbal jelly, but it didn’t save much.

Xu Shujun thought this would be the end, but then she heard Stella tell the waiter, “I’d like another portion of everything I just ordered to go, for the drinks…”

**[I want hand-pulled old-style milk tea and fruit ice cream for dessert!]**

The finance system chimed in her mind.

“...For the drink, I’ll have hand-pulled old-style milk tea and for dessert, fruit ice cream. Please make this second order when we’re almost done eating.”

“Okay, just a moment please.”

After the waiter noted down the orders, she left.

Before long, the waiter pushed a cart with their ordered dishes, all raw and fresh, over to their table.

Xu Shujun stared in astonishment at the king crab that was as big as a basin, which the waiter deftly placed in the steaming pot in the center of the table.

Because the king crab was alive, it tried to escape several times during the process, only to be swiftly suppressed by the waiter, who was busy placing other seafood, and finally, all of them were covered by the pot lid together, heading to their fate.

As the rich aroma of seafood filled the air, Xu Shujun felt increasingly nervous.

Why weren’t they talking?

Hadn’t Stella said she wanted to scout her?

On Xu Shujun's side, her heart was racing; on the other side, Stella was wondering when the king crab would be ready to eat.

This was her first time having king crab.

The last time Stella treated her colleagues to fancy bento, there had been seafood, but she had taken the leftover wagyu, so she hadn’t tasted the crab legs in the seafood bento.

Having missed out once, she often thought about it.

But every meal, she forgot about it.

Finally, today, she was about to get a taste.

Twenty minutes later, the seafood was ready.

The waiter approached, reminding the guests to step back to avoid being burned by the steam, and without fear of the heat, she opened the pot lid.

A cloud of hot steam rushed out, bringing with it the overpowering fragrance of seafood.

The waiter used sharp scissors to deftly dismantle the now-red king crab, quickly breaking it down into pieces.

When Stella saw the waiter handing her a crab leg that had been expertly processed, she thanked the waiter and passed it to Xu Shujun’s bowl.

Xu Shujun quickly expressed her gratitude, and when Stella also had a crab leg and popped the meat into her mouth, she finally felt at ease and began to enjoy her meal.

So fresh and sweet!

Xu Shujun marveled. No wonder it was so expensive!

After devouring two king crab legs, satisfied, Stella returned to the previous topic.

“Shujun, have you thought about it? Do you have any thoughts on switching companies?”

Stella continued, “You can take your time to think it over.”

“I don’t want to deceive you; actually, I haven’t registered the company yet. Xingchen Entertainment hasn’t started up, and I haven’t decided where to set it up yet.”

“But I can assure you that I will have everything sorted out within a month.”

“Let’s exchange contact information. If you’re willing to join my company then, I will gladly pay the termination fee for you, allowing you to leave your current company.”

Stella spoke earnestly.

Xu Shujun paused her shrimp peeling, stunned for a moment before finally voicing her burning question, “President Ling, I want to know, why did you choose me? I don’t think I’m particularly good-looking…”

Stella detected the self-doubt in Xu Shujun’s voice.

She scrutinized the girl’s appearance.

She was a fresh-faced beauty, like a girl next door.

In the entertainment industry, Xu Shujun might not stand out among the sea of handsome faces and beautiful figures, but to Stella, that wasn’t a flaw.

What she cared about was the 9.3 score floating above her head for her street dance skills!

Besides, Xu Shujun wasn’t even unattractive!

If she felt this way about her looks, then Stella should probably bury her own face in the ground and never show it to the world!

“Shujun, what I’m interested in is your dancing talent, not your looks. I want to form an idol girl group focused on singing and dancing in the POP style that’s popular in Han Country. I’m looking for someone who excels in both singing and dancing, not just a pretty face that relies on looks on stage.”

“Although it’s hard to admit, the mainstream idol market right now isn’t in the C-POP mode of Huaguo; it’s in the K-POP mode of Han Country. After all, C-POP has only recently emerged.”

“But I want to create a C-POP idol girl group that’s even better than the top K-POP idols in Han Country!”

Xu Shujun was taken aback by Stella’s bold statement.

A C-POP idol girl group that’s better than the top K-POP idols in Han Country!

What a big ambition!

Xu Shujun quickly stuffed a shrimp into her mouth to calm herself.

She sensed the ambition in Stella’s powerful words.

Did she have such ambition?

Yes, she did.

She had always had the ambition to reach the pinnacle of being an idol, but due to her looks, she had never dared to express it.
