**Only the Ethnic is Truly Global**

Stella Ling felt invigorated!

But when she caught sight of the girl with a 9.6 rating, it was as if someone had doused her with a bucket of cold water.

The person in front of her was someone Stella recognized—the girl with half-pink, half-black hair and smoky eye makeup whom she had encountered earlier that day at BVLGARI.

“...I’m fine,” Stella gasped, struggling to stand back up.

“Glad to hear that,” the girl replied, her name being Song Mengmeng. She nodded slightly at Stella, her impressive 9.6 rating gleaming above her head as she turned to leave.

“Wait a second!” Stella called out, her legs feeling weak and unsteady as she approached Song Mengmeng.

This was a 9.6! A score that was 0.3 points higher than Xu Shujun’s!

Even if she might be perceived as foolish for approaching her, Stella felt compelled to give it a shot. After all, one misstep on the path of life could lead to disaster.

Yet, the girl in front of her was still quite young.

If one is young and makes mistakes, as long as they find their way back, their future can still be brilliant.

“I’ve seen you before. We ran into each other at BVLGARI today, right?” Stella said, her eyes sparkling with hope as she looked at Song Mengmeng.

“Yeah, I remember you,” Song Mengmeng nodded. She vividly recalled Stella purchasing that emerald jewelry watch, thinking to herself how wealthy the people in this city were, buying jewelry worth over two million without batting an eye.

Feeling a bit shy, Song Mengmeng added, “I have to go, so… bye!”

“Just a moment!” Stella called out again.

Not knowing when they might cross paths again, she felt it was crucial to keep this conversation going. She immediately voiced her intentions, “You must be a trainee, right? I’m Stella Ling, the president of Starshine Entertainment. Our company is looking for members for a girl group, aiming to create a C-POP idol group that can surpass H-POP’s top stars. Are you interested?”

“If you’re already under contract, we can cover your termination fee for you. It’s free, and you won’t have to pay it back.”

Song Mengmeng paused at Stella’s words, turning around to respond, “I’m Song Mengmeng. My termination fee is 1.5 million.”

Stella waved her hand dismissively, “Money isn’t an issue. As long as you’re willing to join our company, I’ll cover any termination fees.”

Song Mengmeng furrowed her brow and said, “You misunderstood. I’m aware you have the money to pay the fee, but I’m curious as to why you chose me?”

Did she really think she was worth covering 1.5 million?

Stella wanted to use the same line she had used to woo Xu Shujun, claiming she had been watching her for a while, but it felt inappropriate to say that now. If she had been paying attention, why hadn’t she approached her at BVLGARI earlier?

“Because you caught my eye, and your image is quite impressive,” Stella quickly made up a reason. She glanced at the 9.6 rating floating above Song Mengmeng’s head and continued, “I believe you have great potential for singing.”

“You’ve heard me sing?” Song Mengmeng blinked, curious.

“No, but I bet you sing beautifully. Your voice is quite special—raspy yet pleasant. I think you have the talent we need,” Stella continued with her improvisation.

Hearing this, Song Mengmeng couldn’t feel happy. She cleared her throat uneasily and explained, “I just recovered from a cold, and my voice hasn’t fully returned. This isn’t my real voice.”

Stella: “…”

She had clearly flattered her the wrong way!

After a moment of awkward silence, Song Mengmeng broke the tension, saying, “Thank you for your invitation! How about this: I’m going to Black Whale Bar to sing soon. You could come with me to see how I perform and then think about whether you want to recruit me.”

With that, she reached behind her and tapped the long wooden box slung over her shoulder.

Stella realized that Song Mengmeng was happy that someone valued her, but since this young CEO didn’t seem to know anything about her singing, she wanted to let her know what her real strengths were before she made any decisions.

The company she was currently signed to had once valued her too, but after various considerations, they felt she wasn’t suited for the current entertainment industry, thinking she was too niche. They believed that even if she did become popular, it would only be fleeting.

Stella then noticed the long black wooden box on Song Mengmeng’s back, realizing it likely contained some kind of instrument.

Is it a guitar? 

Stella guessed and quickly agreed to go with Song Mengmeng to Black Whale Bar. She was eager to hear her sing.

A 9.6 rating for singing! It had to be amazing!

On their way to the bar, Stella stopped by a pharmacy for a short while, emerging wearing a mask.

She had met Lu Mingxu at a karaoke venue before.

Who knew if there would be more of those Heaven’s Chosen Ones in a bar like this?

Wearing a mask to cover her face might help a bit, right?

However, after walking a few steps, Stella found the situation amusing and pulled off the mask.

Although she was quite satisfied with her appearance, she knew she looked ordinary. Those Heaven’s Chosen Ones were attracted to her luck, not her looks—what was the point of hiding her face?

Better to show it off confidently.

Song Mengmeng tilted her head slightly, watching Stella’s antics with curiosity.

After about eight minutes of walking, they arrived at Black Whale Bar.

Once inside, Stella was a bit surprised.

She had never been to a bar before, thinking it would be a noisy dance club.

To her astonishment, it was quite the opposite.

The bar was brightly lit, with a few tables arranged like a restaurant inside.

Urban men and women sat at the tables, sipping drinks, munching on snacks, and chatting casually with each other. It was far from loud, resembling a relaxed gathering with friends.

“Feel free to find a seat anywhere. If a server comes by and asks if you want to order drinks, just tell them you’re my friend and you’re waiting for me to finish. They’ll leave you alone. I have to go perform now. See you later!” Song Mengmeng instructed, heading towards the stage.

Stella watched as Song Mengmeng took the stage, removing the long wooden box from her back and opening it to reveal an instrument she had never seen before.

It looked a bit like a two-stringed instrument, complete with a bow.

Song Mengmeng sat down on the stool at the stage, adjusted the microphone in front of her, and placed the bow across the strings.

Most of the patrons in the bar turned their attention to Song Mengmeng on stage, curious to see what kind of performance this girl with a somewhat alternative appearance would deliver.

Someone recognized the instrument and commented to their friend, “That’s a Morin Khuur, a traditional instrument from Inner Mongolia.”

“This girl is Mongolian? Is she going to sing in Mongolian?”

“No idea, let’s listen.”

Hearing their conversation, Stella felt her anticipation growing. She quickly found a seat, ready to enjoy the performance.

Song Mengmeng leaned closer to the microphone and softly began to sing.

“yi~wu~wa~~a~~”

The sounds she produced were akin to a string instrument transformed by a wind instrument, yet she wasn’t even moving the bow! The sound was undeniably coming from her mouth!

Stella felt as if she were hearing two tones at once—how could a person produce two sounds simultaneously?

“Whoa! This is throat singing! And it’s female throat singing!”

“Who is this girl? She’s amazing!”

“I have goosebumps all over!”

So this was what throat singing was!

Stella didn’t even have time to pull out her phone to look it up; her gaze was firmly fixed on Song Mengmeng. She was captivated, realizing the incredible potential of that 9.6 rating!

After an extended display of throat singing, Song Mengmeng began to pluck the strings, producing a melodic, soulful sound.

Stella had never heard such a sound before. In that moment, she felt as though she was transported to a vast grassland, the fresh scent of grass wafting into her nostrils.

“Damn! Listening to this makes me want to go to the grasslands and munch on some grass!” someone lamented.

As Song Mengmeng continued to sing, accompanied by the sound of the instrument, traditional Mongolian folk tunes flowed from her lips.

In the bar, Song Mengmeng was the only Mongolian present, and aside from her, no one understood the lyrics she was singing.

Yet, everyone present shared a common feeling: it was beautiful, and they were thoroughly enjoying it.

They felt as if they were galloping on horseback across the grasslands, their souls washed clean.

However, the song felt more like a call from ancient times, awakening slumbering spirits and penetrating their very beings.

Even if they couldn’t comprehend the words, they were left in awe!

This was divine music!

For the first time witnessing such a performance, Stella felt an overwhelming excitement and made a firm decision to recruit this 9.6 talent!

After the performance concluded, the entire bar erupted into enthusiastic applause for Song Mengmeng.

“Miss, you sang beautifully!”

“So good!”

“Amazing!”

Song Mengmeng bowed in gratitude to the audience before opening the instrument case to put away the Morin Khuur.

“Sing another song!”

“Yeah, we want to hear more!”

“Please sing another!”

“No! She can’t sing anymore; her throat isn’t fully recovered!”

At this moment, Stella suddenly stood up and shouted.

It was the loudest she had ever spoken in her life, nearly losing her voice.

She quickly approached the stage and spoke into the microphone, “I apologize everyone! The singer has just recovered from a cold, and her throat isn’t fully healed yet, so she can’t sing anymore today. Please wait for her next performance!”

Though Stella didn’t understand the specifics of what Song Mengmeng was singing, she could tell that both the throat singing and the Mongolian song were incredibly difficult to perform.

Given Song Mengmeng's condition, each performance would put a considerable strain on her throat.

Today, she couldn’t sing anymore.

Once Song Mengmeng was fully recovered, she would bring her to perform on a proper stage!

The patrons of the bar were well-mannered, and upon hearing Stella’s words, they didn’t press the issue any further.

“Then we’ll wait for next time.”

“Next time, make sure to sing a few more songs!”

“The singer’s voice is important; it should be well-protected.”

One person, thinking that the young woman adorned in glittering jewels was the bar owner, approached Stella and asked, “Boss, do you have any other singers who can perform in Mongolian?”

“Ah?” 

Stella was taken aback, quickly responding, “I’m not the owner of this bar.”

“Then…?”

The person was confused—why was she up there speaking?

“She’s not the bar owner; she’s my boss! I’m an artist signed under her company!” Song Mengmeng suddenly chimed in, causing Stella to turn in surprise.

Song Mengmeng noticed the unmistakable look of joy on Stella’s face and couldn’t help but smile, revealing her pearly white teeth.

“So that’s how it is! I wish you great success! Your performance was truly wonderful!”

“Thank you,” Song Mengmeng smiled back in appreciation.

Song Mengmeng’s job at the bar today was simply to perform a song and liven up the atmosphere.

With her task complete, she and Stella left the bar.

The two of them made their way to a nearby café, where Stella ordered a coffee for herself but asked for a cup of freshly boiled hot water for Song Mengmeng. She then pulled a bag of herbal tea from her tote and handed it to her, saying, “You should brew this herbal tea. I just bought it at the pharmacy. The pharmacist said this tea is great for protecting the throat; many singers buy it.”

“...Thank you!” 

Song Mengmeng hurriedly expressed her gratitude, pleasantly surprised as she accepted the herbal tea from Stella.

She had assumed that Stella had gone into the pharmacy for a mask, but she hadn’t expected her to also buy something to protect her voice.

Feeling touched, Song Mengmeng found herself at a loss for words.

Despite their awkward first meeting at BVLGARI, she couldn’t believe that Stella, having clearly overheard their conversation, had chosen not to dwell on it. Not only had she invited her to join the company, but she was also so considerate of her well-being…

This reminded her of Li Li.

When she had first come to the city, the first friend to show her kindness was Li Li.

“Don’t mention it,” Stella replied, confirming her earlier proposal, “My offer still stands. I’d like to invite you to join Starshine Entertainment. Your response earlier in the bar indicates your agreement, doesn’t it?”

“Yes.” 

Song Mengmeng nodded but then hesitated, saying, “Don’t you think my style is too niche? All I have are throat singing and playing the Morin Khuur. My current company feels that I lack marketability and dropped their plans to debut me after being halted on a talent show.”

“You’re overlooking an advantage—you can speak Mongolian,” Stella countered.

Song Mengmeng felt a bit shy at that, explaining, “Most of us Mongolians can speak Mongolian; it doesn’t count as a unique advantage.”

But Stella replied, “Why wouldn’t it? Your current company doesn’t know how to market you. Only the ethnic is truly global!”

Stella hadn’t expected that Song Mengmeng was from a minority group.

She sang so beautifully!

Moreover, with her impressive vocal abilities, she could surely handle any challenging songs in Mandarin as well.

If you asked Stella, Song Mengmeng’s current company was simply narrow-minded, fixated on the idea of niche markets and lacking the insight to find her true selling points.

Didn’t the cheers from the bar just now prove that?

It was clear they didn’t know how to find resources related to her strengths!
