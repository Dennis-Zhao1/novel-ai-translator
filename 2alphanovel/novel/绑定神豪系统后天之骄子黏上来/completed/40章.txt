**Chapter 1: The Search for Stars**

Stella Ling was eager to personally test out her newly acquired skill. She was set on starting an entertainment company focused on stage performances, similar to those in Han Country that formed girl groups and boy bands. The members of these groups typically began as trainees, and Stella intended to find promising candidates for her future agency.

She searched online to find entertainment companies in Jing City that trained trainees. Her plan was to casually run into some trainees and assess their potential. If any of them had high potential, she would take note of them and, once her company was established, offer to recruit them.

Around seven in the evening, Stella changed into her outing clothes, left her rented apartment, and took a taxi to Sanlitun SOHO in Chaoguang District. She had just checked online and discovered that many entertainment agencies cultivating trainees were located there, where fans often gathered to catch a glimpse of their idols.

After getting out of the cab, Stella walked along a brightly lit street for a while before entering a café frequented by young people. The place was buzzing with well-dressed youths, and it was likely that many of them were trainees from nearby entertainment companies.

She ordered a latte and chose a seat, glancing over at a table where five young women were animatedly discussing something. Stella activated her Insightful Eyes and focused on the neighboring table.

“Potential Score: 4.8, 3.6, 5, 4.9… 1.9.”

Stella felt a wave of disappointment wash over her. With a maximum potential score of 10, a passing grade was 6, and none of the five girls had even reached that threshold.

She took a sip of her coffee, trying to shake off the disappointment, and shifted her gaze to another table. There sat three boys and four girls. The girls seemed decent, but the boys' outfits were so trendy that Stella could hardly comprehend their style.

She assessed the girls first.

“4.1, 3.9, 5.4, 2.8—still no pass.”

Next, she glanced at the boys: one with bangs covering his eyes, another with dreadlocks, and a third sporting long, slanted white hair.

“4.1, 6!… 2.”

Stella was surprised to discover one passing score, but upon closer inspection, she quickly decided against approaching the guy with dreadlocks. Just passing wasn’t enough; she was looking for candidates with potential scores of 8 or 9. 

“5, 6.2, 3.3…”

“5.7, 4.7, 1.3—ugh!”

Stella’s anxiety began to mount as she scanned the café. She had nearly assessed everyone there, and she had only found two with passing scores, but none with high potential. 

“Hey, what are you mumbling about over here?” A curious male voice interrupted her thoughts.

Stella turned to look, and her heart skipped a beat—an 8!

She examined the man more closely but soon felt disheartened again. He was fashionably dressed but otherwise quite ordinary, much like herself. He was not particularly tall, and his build was average. Most concerning was his apparent age; he looked to be in his thirties.

Stella was puzzled. The entertainment industry was notorious for valuing youth and looks, so how could this unremarkable man have such a high potential score?

As she scrutinized him, four words suddenly appeared above his potential score: **Music Producer**.

That made sense. In music, talent trumped appearance.

Stella quickly stood up with a smile, eager to engage him. “Who are you?”

The man, startled by her sudden movement, stepped back slightly and chuckled nervously, “No, no, you don’t have to be nervous! I was just curious about the numbers you were saying.”

Faced with the potential powerhouse, Stella decided to lay her cards on the table. “I’m here to scout for trainees.”

“Oh, so you’re a talent scout?” The man seemed to understand, realizing she was assessing the trainees around her.

“No, I’m planning to open an entertainment company,” Stella clarified, inviting him to sit across from her.

The man, intrigued, took a seat. He noticed Stella's designer outfit and the luxurious jewelry she wore—a platinum necklace with blue gems shaped like an owl and a stunning ruby ring on her pinky. He quickly believed her words. 

Such a display of wealth was something only major celebrities wore at high-profile events. Surely, this woman was not just an ordinary person.

“Are you planning to open your company here?” he asked.

Stella shook her head. “No, I don’t plan to set up in Jing City. I just want to scout trainees here.”

The man looked puzzled. “Why? Jing City is the capital!”

Indeed, Jing City was the political and cultural center of Huaguo. Resources, capital, and talent were concentrated there, making it the ideal place for an entertainment company to thrive. Most would choose to open their businesses here rather than in places like Hushi.

Stella hesitated, “I have my reasons.” She was keenly aware of Jing City’s advantages but knew those very reasons were why she could not set up shop there.

Seeing her reluctance to elaborate, the man didn’t press further. “Why not recruit from art schools instead?” he suggested, changing the topic.

Stella thought about the information she had gathered. “That seems too complicated.”

“Since Huaguo has banned talent shows, many companies can’t take advantage of the popularity to debut their trainees. Those who’ve been trained well end up stuck without a way to debut. That’s why I’m here—to poach those well-trained trainees.”

Recruiting from art schools would take years of training. Stella lacked the patience and wanted to get her company running quickly. That’s why she aimed to snatch up trainees who were already polished.

The man looked taken aback. “That’s going to cost a lot!”

Entertainment companies that had invested heavily in trainees weren’t easy to negotiate with, and the termination fees for trainees could be substantial.

“Money isn’t an issue. As long as they’re good candidates, I’ll pay whatever it takes to bring them on board,” Stella replied nonchalantly. She was confident that the Celestial Fortune System would support her financially.

“Right, meow!” the system chimed in her mind.

The man was impressed by Stella’s boldness. He realized that while she might have money, he was surprised she would invest so heavily before her company was even established. She was clearly a force to be reckoned with.

Leaning closer, he whispered, “But you won’t find what you’re looking for here. At this hour, trainees out with friends are basically just ‘circle hustlers’—they’re not dedicated, and no amount of talent will help if they don’t put in the effort.”

“Circle hustlers?” Stella echoed, intrigued.

“Yeah, it’s not a flattering term. No wonder the trainees in this café have such low potential scores. Even if two of them passed, if they lack dedication and discipline, they’ll never reach their potential.”

He chuckled, “These trainees might not be entirely hopeless. Maybe they’re just unwinding after a long day before heading back to practice. The real hustlers are mostly in the bars nearby—just starting out in the entertainment circle: small-time artists, singers, actors, and models.”

“Every day, I’d bet these kids are at bars mingling at least three times a week. They think these social gatherings are great for networking.”

“Why do they go out for drinks every night?” Stella asked.

“Because they believe it’s a way to make connections. The more people they know, the more resources and opportunities they get.”

“If they happen to meet a big shot at one of those gatherings, they think it’s their chance to shine.”

“People like the big names enjoy having a crowd to boost their egos. Some of the more seasoned folks will tell newcomers that if they want to get ahead, they need to build relationships—with an emphasis on ‘relationships.’” 

The emphasis he put on those last words made Stella understand the implications all too clearly: it was about using their bodies to gain favor, regardless of gender.

Hu Dongdong sighed, continuing, “For many of these young trainees, they’d rather indulge in the party lifestyle than commit to the hard work of improving their skills. The entertainment industry sends a clear message that talent doesn’t matter, leading many to become mere hustlers.”

“In their lives, no one discusses knowledge or insights; it’s all about resources and connections. Very few take the time to actually learn the skills they should be honing as trainees.”

“Most of them arrived in this city with dreams of success, but now…” He shook his head, “If I try to talk to them about aspirations, they look at me like I’m crazy.”

“Do you talk to them?” Stella asked.

“Of course! I’m a music producer and have taught a few trainees. Most of them are just lazy and uninterested in learning.” 

Hu Dongdong’s words were a warning to her: even if she found trainees trained for years, many of them could still be entrenched in that hustler mindset.

“Where do you think I should go to find experienced trainees who aren’t hustlers?” she inquired.

“Definitely the dance studios in entertainment companies. But you can’t go in there to steal trainees. You can wait here until around ten; the trainees coming out after late practice are usually the hard-working ones who are serious about improving.”

“Some even go to another place to practice after that. Those are the rare gems.”

Stella realized that by the time those trainees came out, her Insightful Eyes would no longer be effective. It seemed she would have to return tomorrow.

To thank Hu Dongdong for his valuable information, Stella decided to treat him to a late-night meal at Quan Ju De.

He readily accepted, eager to get to know the woman planning to open her entertainment company.

After dinner, they exchanged phone numbers and WeChat contacts. Although Stella expressed interest in inviting Hu Dongdong to join her company, he politely declined. 

He wanted to remain with his current agency, where he aspired to continue his work as a music producer.

Stella understood; she had been overly eager. After all, her company was still just an idea, and he had no reason to leave an established position for something uncertain.

The next evening, just before ten, Stella returned to Sanlitun SOHO. At this hour, the dance studios in various entertainment companies were still bustling with trainees practicing late into the night. 

Holding a warm cup of coffee, she gazed out the café’s window, hoping to spot some young figures emerging from the nearby entertainment companies.
