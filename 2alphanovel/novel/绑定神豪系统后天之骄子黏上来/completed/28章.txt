**Buying a House?**

After watching all the clarifying videos, Stella Ling genuinely felt happy for Li Qichen. 

She searched for the account of Meng Yan Bansha, only to find out that it had been permanently banned from the platform for maliciously defaming others. However, the videos she had posted before the ban were still available to view.

Stella clicked on Meng Yan Bansha's latest video—the one where she slandered Li Qichen. The comments section was filled with heated responses from Douyin users who had watched Li Qichen's side of the clarification video and came to denounce her.

“Seriously! What a joke! She’s crying over what? It’s totally normal for him to refuse to add her on WeChat, yet she acts like she’s suffered such a huge injustice! She even posted it online, trying to incite her brainless fans to bully him! This isn't just being overly sensitive; it's both foolish and dramatic!”

“Not just foolish and dramatic, but criminal!”

“She has over five million followers on Douyin and should know the impact she wields. To slander an ordinary person online, her character speaks for itself!”

“Wow! This idiot woman’s actions are truly baffling! She got rejected and still dared to provoke the real girlfriend in the store, and hilariously, she picked the wrong target! Is she insane with jealousy? She’s really embarrassing us women!”

“I’ve never liked Meng Yan Bansha. She spends her days either trying to create a CP with that male streamer for clout or competing with this female streamer over looks. She can’t dance, can’t sing, and has no serious work—no idea why she has so many fans.”

“It’s all about her tea art! Most of her fans are men. Didn’t you see? After the video dropped this morning, those male fans were so heartbroken they wanted to jump into the surveillance video to beat up the male ordinary person! Some even said they wanted to dox that poor guy and confront him!”

“Is it really that terrifying? Online bullying is scary enough! If that male ordinary person hadn’t clarified in time, he might have really been beaten up by Meng Yan Bansha’s brainless fans!”

“Once she cried, the dogs came running to lick her.”

“Let’s not stigmatize dogs; they are humans’ best friends!”

“Exactly, I’m a dog lover. Please refer to those who like to lick as turtle men.”

“I’m a turtle lover; don’t insult my cute turtles!”

“Don’t speak for all men! I don’t like Meng Yan Bansha!”

“Right, I don't like her either. I always found her too dramatic and uncomfortable to watch.”

“However, the love of male fans is unreliable. Previously, those fans were all saying they wanted to stand up for Meng Yan Bansha, but after the clarification video dropped, they immediately turned on her, calling her a fraud and accusing her of using them.”

“There’s nothing wrong with that! I used to be her fan, got furious after watching her video, but who would’ve thought the person they liked would deceive them? Once I realized I was duped, of course I had to lash back and demand an explanation.”

“Every trashy internet celebrity has their fans! Ugh, disgusting!”

“I used to love green tea, but after seeing Meng Yan Bansha’s tactics, I’ve decided to quit.”

“No need to quit, real green tea is innocent! It’s just a plant, yet it gets associated with morally bankrupt people!”

“This is the most disgusting video I’ve seen this year!”

“Just thinking about how this video might be shared by nosy onlookers abroad, making foreigners laugh at it, makes me feel embarrassed.”

“No need to feel embarrassed; there are plenty of more disgusting internet celebrities abroad than Meng Yan Bansha, and they won’t even get banned online.”

“She still has the face to cry! Truly, those who don’t know how to be humble are invincible!”

“No, the police will teach those who don’t know how to be humble a lesson; she’s already been taken in.”

“Is that true? I only heard she was taken away by the police. Has she really been sent to the detention center so soon? When will she be sentenced? For how many years?”

“Wow, surely she won’t be sentenced, right?”

“Why not? There are plenty of tragedies caused by online bullying! There’s so much evidence of her slander posted online. It just depends on whether that male ordinary person agrees to mediation. If not, Meng Yan Bansha will definitely end up in prison! Douyin really needs to clean up its act; any Tom, Dick, or Harry can become an internet celebrity!”

“I just checked; those convicted of defamation face up to three years in prison, criminal detention, or control, or deprivation of political rights.”

“This is truly satisfying; I hope the male ordinary person stands firm and lets Meng Yan Bansha serve time.”

“Meng Yan” is a play on words for “Meng Yan Bansha,” a nickname given by netizens.

“Agreed!”

……

“Wow! I just saw the apology video from the Douyin CEO!”

“Is that for real? I need to see it!”

Stella felt a spark of curiosity and exited the comments section to search for the apology video. 

Once she found it and clicked in, she saw a middle-aged man sincerely apologizing in the video. 

In short, he was apologizing for the negative publicity incident caused by Meng Yan Bansha, for the male ordinary person who was bullied online, and for Douyin users, promising to thoroughly clean up the platform and firmly resist the trend of online bullying, ensuring that celebrities like Meng Yan Bansha with warped morals would not continue to pollute the platform’s environment.

“Am I the only one who noticed that when the Douyin CEO apologized, he prioritized the male ordinary person over us users? That guy must have some serious connections!”

Stella clicked into the video comments section and, after seeing the most liked comment, a knowing smile appeared in her eyes. 

Li Qichen was the president of Jinghua International Trade, and his status was certainly not ordinary. 

The netizens were sensitive, indeed. 

“Stop overthinking! The male ordinary person is the biggest victim in this incident, so it’s only right to apologize to him first. We come second, and I think that’s fair.”

“I feel like I’ve seen that male ordinary person before; he seems like a big deal.”

“The surveillance footage released by Meng Yan Bansha is so blurry it’s like looking at dog poop; how can we tell who it is? Besides, the clear face was blurred out!”

“Do you think the male ordinary person looks like *&*^?”

“Why is the above comment garbled?”

“Damn, I didn’t know that name is a banned word on Douyin; I can’t post it!”

“Seriously! Even the pinyin is banned—can the abbreviation work? LQC!”

“The abbreviation went through! I’m sure the male ordinary person in the video is LQC! No wonder the clarification came so quickly!”

“What? Is there an inside story? Was Meng Yan Bansha wronged?”

“Bullshit; she’s not wronged! Go search the surveillance video released by the Douyin big shot; the footage and audio are legit. Meng Yan Bansha tried to play tricks but kicked a steel plate, messing with the wrong person. She deserves what’s coming to her!”

“Looks like LQC is really something special; even the Douyin CEO got involved! Douyin has had a few bullying incidents before, but has the CEO ever apologized before? Just this time!”

“In previous cases of online bullying, didn’t the victims have to wait until they were bullied for a while before coming out to clarify? Because they were just ordinary people, they had to spend a lot of time and effort gathering evidence to fight back. I’ve never seen such a quick and decisive counterattack against online bullying with such comprehensive evidence; the true identity of the male ordinary person must be extraordinary.”

“So who exactly is LQC? I’m so curious it’s driving me insane; give me another hint!”

“Risking being censored, I’ll give you another hint: Jinghua International Trade.”

“Jinghua International Trade? Isn’t that where this incident happened?”

“I’m hitting the floor! I know who that is! Meng Yan Bansha is truly seeking death by daring to bully him!”

“Now I’m even more curious! Who is it? Can some big shot give me another hint, please?”

“The more I say, the scarier it gets. Meng Yan Bansha isn’t going to lose her life over this, is she?”

“Nothing that extreme; at most, she’ll lose her internet celebrity career and spend three years in prison.”

“You scared me! The way you’re talking is so mysterious, I almost thought Meng Yan Bansha had provoked gangsters and would end up being encased in cement and dumped in a river!”

“There are no gangs in Huaguo; stop imagining things!”

Reading through these comments, Stella couldn’t help but laugh out loud. 

After laughing, she couldn’t help but think deeply. 

Li Qichen’s social standing was so high that, in Stella’s eyes, they seemed like people from entirely different worlds, likely never to have any connection in their lives. 

So why did he want to add her on WeChat that day? 

He had rejected the beautiful Meng Yan Bansha, yet he actively sought to connect with a regular woman like her. 

How strange… 

The more Stella pondered, the more she felt something was off. But as her lunch break came to an end, she had no choice but to push her questions to the back of her mind and start working. 

After work, Zhang Aiyue called everyone over, saying the company was organizing a dinner, and it had something to do with their collaboration with Jinghua International Trade. 

Thinking about her plans to go house-hunting after work, Stella asked Zhang Aiyue for leave, saying she had other things to attend to and might not make it. 

Zhang Aiyue readily nodded in agreement with her request. 

Stella was leaving the company on the 15th of this month, so attending this dinner wouldn’t affect her in any way. 

Once she left the company, Stella headed back to the dessert shop she had visited at noon. 

Finding a spot to sit in the shop, she ordered a slice of mango mousse cake and a cup of coffee to cleanse her palate, then downloaded a housing transaction app on her phone to start searching for options. 

Stella planned to buy a place in the city center because she would be living alone and didn’t want anything too large—around 150 square meters would be perfect. 

After much deliberation, Stella found a 175-square-meter four-bedroom, two-living-room, two-bathroom layout in the Platinum Impression development and called the sales office for more information. 

“Hello, this is a property consultant from Platinum Impression. How can I assist you today?” 

A sweet female voice came through the line, and Stella felt a bit nervous as she replied, “I’d like to buy a house.” 

“May I ask if you hold a local household registration for Jing City or are you from out of town?” 

“From out of town.” 

“Do you have proof of paying taxes continuously in Jing City for five years, or proof of social insurance in Jing City for five consecutive years?” 

“Uh, no.” 

Stella sensed something was off. 

“I’m sorry, but you cannot purchase property in Jing City unless you can provide that proof. We only offer buying services here.” 

The consultant’s voice remained sweet, but Stella noticed they were no longer as enthusiastic as at the beginning. She quickly replied, “Sorry for the interruption.” 

Then she hurriedly hung up the phone. 

Afterward, Stella quickly searched online for the requirements for out-of-town residents to buy property in Jing City, only to realize that, given her circumstances, she simply couldn’t buy a house there! 

It turned out that out-of-town families wanting to purchase in Jing City need to have a valid temporary residence permit, and they must not already own property in the city. They also need to declare proof of continuous social insurance or individual tax payments for five years in the city. 

No wonder the consultant asked those questions right off the bat; she must have dealt with out-of-town residents who were clueless about the buying requirements in Jing City before and had learned from those experiences. 

Stella looked over the requirements for out-of-town residents again and found that she only met two of the criteria: the temporary residence permit and the fact that she didn’t own property in Jing City.

Since Stella was studying at a university in Jing City, she had to apply for a temporary residence permit every year as an out-of-town student. 

As for not owning property in Jing City… how could she possibly have any! 

Did this mean she really had to work for five years at a company before she could buy a house in Jing City? 

Stella had never thought she could buy a house in Jing City, so she hadn’t looked into this aspect before, assuming that as long as one had money, they could purchase a property there… 

**[Xiaoxing, what now? Are we still moving into a bigger house?]**

“Of course we are! If we can’t buy, then we’ll rent!” Stella replied, thinking that the money she had could cover rent in Jing City for a lifetime. 

However, she still longed to have a place that truly belonged to her. 

At that moment, Stella suddenly remembered the newbie gift pack reward she had received. 

“System, back when you gave me that newbie gift pack lottery, there was a property reward. If I had drawn that reward back then, how would you help me legally obtain that property given my situation?” 

Stella asked excitedly, feeling like she had found a loophole in buying a house. 

**[Hehe! I could use high-tech means to fabricate a relative for you in Jing City, allowing them to transfer the property to you through inheritance!]** the system proudly declared. 

Stella: “…” 

What a high-tech operation! She definitely couldn’t pull that off. 

Feeling a bit deflated, Stella began searching online for ways to quickly obtain a household registration in Jing City. 

Although she had temporarily transferred her household registration to Jing City while attending university, it was just a temporary collective household registration for the university—it didn’t mean she was genuinely settled there. 

If she could obtain a real household registration in Jing City, she wouldn’t need to declare proof of continuous social insurance or individual tax payments for five years and could directly buy a house. 

After looking into it, Stella found that she had only three paths available. 

First, by passing the civil service exam and being hired by state-owned enterprises, public institutions, or high-tech companies with a Beijing quota, she would have a chance at obtaining a household registration in Jing City. 

Second, being recognized as a national model worker or performing an act of bravery in Jing City and receiving an award for it. 

Third, being a businessman who has made outstanding contributions to Jing City’s economic development. 

Each of these three paths would be incredibly challenging! 

Stella resigned herself and opened the housing transaction app again; she should first focus on sorting out her rental situation.
