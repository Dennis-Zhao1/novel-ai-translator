**Future Sister-in-Law**

As Liang Yang came rushing over, his plump figure jiggled with each step, and Lu Mingxu quickly approached to stop him. "Watch it! Don't spill the food!"

"Got it!" Liang Yang replied cheerfully, slowing his pace and beaming with a smile as he explained, "Don’t worry, Lu Shao! These medicinal dishes are packed securely, so nothing will spill out!"

Lu Mingxu took the paper bag and asked, "Which one is for the woman?"

"The one on top," Liang Yang answered.

After getting his answer, Lu Mingxu grabbed the bag and started walking. It wasn’t until he reached the hospital room that he noticed Liang Yang was still trailing behind him.

"Why are you following me?" Lu Mingxu frowned at the chubby man behind him.

"I’m just worried you might need help later, so I thought I could stick around," Liang Yang said, scratching his head and smiling, looking quite endearing.

Lu Mingxu considered it for a moment before nodding. "Alright, wait outside then. Don’t come in; I’m afraid you’ll scare her."

"Scare who?" Liang Yang asked curiously, feeling a bit hurt. He was just a little overweight; surely, he wasn’t that scary!

"Your future sister-in-law," Lu Mingxu said, a smile of happiness spreading across his face.

Seeing the blissful grin on Lu Mingxu’s face, Liang Yang was taken aback, even stepping back in shock. 

Oh my gosh! 

When had the notorious playboy Lu Shao ever shown such a nauseatingly sweet smile?

This is terrifying!

In the past, whenever Lu Shao introduced a new girlfriend to their group, he’d simply say it was his current partner, never even mentioning the word "girlfriend." To him, those women were merely toys—objects to be used, not equals.

It looked like Lu Shao had really fallen this time!

He had jumped straight from the title of “girlfriend” to “sister-in-law”!

"What’s with that expression? You don’t believe me?" Lu Mingxu asked, slightly annoyed at Liang Yang’s reaction.

Liang Yang quickly composed himself and straightened up. "Of course I believe you! But if she’s your future sister-in-law, we’ll need to meet eventually. Lu Shao, why don’t you take this chance to introduce her to me?"

Hearing “sister-in-law,” Lu Mingxu smiled even wider. Then, as if recalling something, he confirmed, "Yangzi, you didn’t go out with us last night, did you?"

"Nope, I was with my girlfriend," Liang Yang replied.

"Alright, let me introduce you to your sister-in-law then."

Lu Mingxu nodded, thinking that since Liang Yang wasn’t at the party last night, and since Xiao Xing hadn’t met him, she probably wouldn’t be scared.

But then he remembered that Xiao Xing was currently unwell and needed rest. He decided it would be better to introduce them later on. So, he told Liang Yang, "No, you shouldn’t go in; she’s sick and doesn’t have the energy to meet you right now. I’ll introduce you later, just wait outside."

Without giving Liang Yang a chance to respond, Lu Mingxu grabbed the paper bag and entered the hospital room, leaving Liang Yang outside.

Feeling dejected, Liang Yang stared at the closed door. 

What kind of illness could it be? As long as it wasn’t terminal, meeting someone shouldn't take that much energy, right?

Still, Liang Yang sensed from Lu Mingxu’s reaction that this time, Lu Shao might truly be in deep!

He had never seen Lu Shao so anxious about anyone before!

Once inside the room, Lu Mingxu personally set up the medical dining table for Ling Xiaoxing, arranging the dishes meticulously without letting her lift a finger.

Since entering the hospital, Ling Xiaoxing had been cared for entirely by Lu Mingxu. At this point, she had lost the energy to question his motives for treating her so well. 

Perhaps he genuinely wanted to apologize.

The delicious aroma of the food wafted through the air, and Ling Xiaoxing’s stomach growled softly in response. 

She looked at the two stews and three porcelain plates laid out on the table and realized that apart from the bowl of plain congee, she hadn’t tried any of the other dishes before.

Ling Xiaoxing picked up a spoon and scooped some chicken soup from the stew of black-boned chicken. As the warm liquid touched her lips, the rich flavor exploded in her mouth, complemented by a subtle fragrance reminiscent of medicinal herbs. It was delicious!

Next, she picked up her chopsticks and took a bite of the black-boned chicken, discovering that it was far tastier than regular chicken. The meat was firmer, the flavor more robust, and it even had a hint of sweetness.

Ling Xiaoxing had seen black-boned chickens before; her grandmother’s neighbor used to raise a few. 

Some of those chickens were all white except for their black faces, while others were completely black, looking like little pieces of coal with bright, shiny eyes. They were much smaller than ordinary chickens, yet she found them uniquely beautiful, elegant, and mysterious.

Today, as she tasted black-boned chicken for the first time, she fell in love with it, thinking it was not only pretty but also far more delicious than fried chicken!

"System, I’ll save half of this chicken soup for you. It's even better than KFC!" 

Excited to share her joy, Ling Xiaoxing thought to her closest companion.

【No, no, no!】 
【Xiaoxing, you’re sick right now, and you should eat more good food to recover faster! Once you’re better, we can use the task funds to buy more food!】 

The system struggled against its cravings, trying to suppress the sound of drooling while replying.

"Then I’ll just eat it all myself." 

Ling Xiaoxing felt a bit guilty; she usually shared her food with the system, but today it was all hers, and she felt a little bad about it.

However, the system was right! 

If she wanted to eat something later, she could use her task funds to buy it herself!

With this thought, Ling Xiaoxing happily continued eating.

The black-boned chicken soup, bird’s nest congee, braised beef brisket with fish maw, and steamed pumpkin with lily bulbs were all delicious. The desserts were a platter of goji berry and donkey-hide gelatin cake and purple sweet potato and yam cake.

Lu Mingxu watched the dishes on the table and nodded to himself, recognizing they were all nourishing medicinal dishes suitable for women.

Seeing Xiao Xing enjoying her meal, Lu Mingxu felt satisfied and decided to dig into his own portion of medicinal cuisine.

However, upon seeing what was in his bowl, his expression immediately darkened.

Lamb tail soup, five-black kidney nourishing porridge, steamed soft-shelled turtle, and shrimp with chives, with desserts of chestnut cake and crispy cashews.

What the hell! Wasn’t this the kind of kidney-nourishing meal his father regularly ate?

What was Liang Yang trying to imply?

When he said to order whatever, it wasn’t supposed to be like this!

Did he really need to supplement in that area?!

Lu Mingxu felt like he was about to explode, but with Ling Xiaoxing there, he could only simmer down his anger for now.

Noticing his change in demeanor, Ling Xiaoxing looked at him with concern. 

Seeing Lu Mingxu glaring at his food with such a grim look, she kindly asked, "Is it not to your taste? I haven’t touched anything other than the chicken soup. We could switch if you want."

"N-no, it’s fine." 

Lu Mingxu quickly waved his hand in refusal, trying to cover up his discomfort. "I’m just not hungry yet; I’d like to eat later."

Seeing that he didn’t want to switch, Ling Xiaoxing didn’t press the issue and continued to enjoy her meal.

Lu Mingxu sighed in relief but couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about the dishes in front of them.

Could it be that Xiao Xing's medicinal dishes were meant to pair with his?
