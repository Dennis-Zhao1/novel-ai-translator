**Chapter 1: The System Falls from the Sky**

The silver moon hung high in the night sky, and a gentle breeze rustled through the air.

On her way home from work, Stella Ling kicked at the small pebbles underfoot as she strolled toward her university dormitory. 

In just a month, she would be graduating.

That meant she could no longer stay in the dorms. She needed to find a place to rent soon.

Housing prices in Beijing were high, and with an influx of people moving in, the demand for rentals was enormous. Rent was steep as a result.

As an orphan without any relatives to turn to, Stella had to consider renting apartments outside the Fifth Ring Road, where the prices were somewhat lower—even if it meant a longer commute.

Right now, she had nearly 10,000 yuan in savings, which she had managed to save during her three-month internship at a company.

Stella had looked at numerous rental listings outside the Fifth Ring Road in recent days. Considering the commute time and expenses, she had already narrowed it down to three one-bedroom apartments that required a deposit of one month’s rent plus three months up front, with a monthly rent not exceeding 2,000 yuan.

These were direct rentals from landlords, and all that was left was to contact them for viewings.

As graduation approached, Stella understood she needed to move out of the dorm as soon as possible to resolve her housing situation and avoid a last-minute scramble when the time came.

But renting early meant spending money sooner, and she was quite comfortable living alone in the four-person dorm, so she really wanted to delay her move.

It all boiled down to one thing: she was broke.

If only she were wealthy!

Stella sighed deeply, kicking the small stone into a nearby flower bed before collecting her thoughts and quickening her pace toward the dormitory.

【Ding! Target detected with a strong desire for wealth. Compatibility with the Celestial Fortune System is 99.9%!】

【System binding in progress... Binding successful!】

Just as she took a couple of quick steps, a childish voice echoed in her mind.

Shaking her head, Stella was puzzled about what was happening. She felt certain that only she could hear this voice, and no one else could.

Could it be that the pressure of life had driven her to the brink of a mental breakdown?

Had she truly lost her mind?

【Hello, Lucky Goose! I am the Celestial Fortune System from the divine, divine 888 Nebula. I sensed your strong desire for wealth and humbly chose to bind with you. Please treat me well from now on!】

Stella couldn’t help but raise her hand to her head, wondering why the voice was still ringing in her ears!

She couldn’t go crazy now!

Once she graduated, she could become a full-time employee at the company, and her salary would double.

With a brighter future just around the corner, how could she go insane?

【Lucky Goose, why are you patting your head? Hurry up and accept the first daily task released by this system: spend 0.1 yuan within 10 minutes.】

【If you succeed, the reward will be the item you purchased with the task funds. If you fail, there will be no punishment, but the funds will be reclaimed by this system.】

Was there really such a thing as free money to buy stuff?

Stella didn’t believe it for a second.

She wanted to ignore the childish voice in her head and just get back to her dorm to wash up and sleep.

Maybe she was just too exhausted from work lately. After a good night’s sleep, the hallucinations in her mind might just fade away.

Yes, that had to be it!

Stella resumed her journey back to the dorm, this time even breaking into a light jog.

【Very good, you’ve sensed the urgency of the task!】

【The task funds are in your pocket, Lucky Goose! Hurry and spend them!】

That childish voice was babbling on again.

It seemed the voice didn’t quite have the right pronunciation, and during its introduction, it had stumbled a bit. Had she inadvertently created a childlike alternate personality due to her mental breakdown?

Stella suspected this new persona might be no older than five.

And how was she supposed to spend 0.1 yuan?

In today’s China, the living standards had improved so much that some kids didn’t even blink at receiving ten yuan as pocket money, let alone 0.1 yuan.

Perhaps because her main persona was so poor, the childlike alternate personality regarded 0.1 yuan as a fortune.

Moreover, since she was walking, there was always a chance she could lose any loose change, so she wouldn’t keep it in her pocket.

With that thought, Stella found herself at the entrance of her dorm building, instinctively reaching into her jeans pocket. To her surprise, she actually pulled out a 0.1 yuan coin.

A chill ran down her spine.

After losing her family, Stella understood the importance of money all too well. After losing her meal money once in high school, she had vowed never to keep cash in her pockets again.

She stared blankly at the coin glinting silver under the moonlight, lost in thought.

Stella returned the coin to her hand and climbed the stairs to Room 505.

No wonder her right thigh had felt uncomfortable while running—it had been that coin!

But when had she even put this coin in her pocket?

Did having a mental breakdown also come with intermittent memory loss?

As Stella entered her dorm room, she pressed the button by the door, and the room was illuminated by the bright light of LED tubes.

Opening her palm, she found the 0.1 yuan coin was now damp with sweat from her grip.

She simply couldn’t remember when she had put that coin in her pocket.

Could it be that she was truly losing her mind?

Just as Stella was doubting whether her mental breakdown had become severe enough to affect her daily life, a fluffy, round ball appeared out of nowhere, floating in mid-air, and shouted at her, “Lucky Goose, what are you dawdling for? You can’t buy anything here, and there are only four minutes left on your task!”

“Hmph! If you don’t like today’s task, this system will reclaim your task funds!”

Saying that, it reached out its furry little paw towards her palm, which held the coin.

Stella, quick as lightning, clenched her fist, trapping the fluffy ball along with the coin, and exclaimed, “That’s my money!”

“Then hurry up and spend it! If you don’t, this system will have to take it back!” The little ball tugged at its paw while warning her in a childish tone.

Feeling the soft, fluffy, and bouncy texture in her hand, Stella finally confirmed that everything in front of her wasn’t a hallucination—she hadn’t lost her mind.

A stroke of luck had truly fallen upon her, even if it was only 0.1 yuan.

But 0.1 yuan was still money!

For someone like Stella, who had to pinch every penny, this was free money she couldn’t pass up!

Without hesitation, she opened the dormitory door and rushed downstairs.

Four minutes left.

There was a small convenience store in front of the dormitory; she should still have time!

Stella sprinted down five flights of stairs at her fastest speed, narrowly avoiding a twisted ankle along the way.

When she reached the convenience store, the childish voice in her head chimed in again, reminding her that there were only 20 seconds left, and began the countdown.

Fortunately, spending 0.1 yuan wouldn’t take long. On a shelf near the cash register, she saw the item she needed.

A milk-flavored lollipop, just 0.1 yuan each.

With swift hands, Stella snatched a lollipop from the shelf and slapped the 0.1 yuan coin on the counter.

Seeing a student dash into the store just to buy a lollipop for 0.1 yuan, the cashier couldn’t help but twitch her lips and explained, “Sorry, this lollipop has gone up in price. It’s now 0.15 yuan each or 0.30 yuan for two.”

What!

Stella maintained a calm expression, but internally, she was shocked!

She had never seen the price go up in four years of college, yet here she was, facing a price hike today!

【13, 12, 11…】

The countdown voice in her mind continued relentlessly, and Stella couldn’t worry about that anymore. She quickly grabbed another lollipop from the shelf and rummaged through her bag for 0.2 yuan.

This cloth wallet, made by her grandmother while she was still alive, was a zippered wallet with intricate embroidery, beautifully crafted, and she had used it ever since.

However, after years of use, the zipper had become a bit worn, and every time she needed to use it, she had to spend extra time to open it.

In the past, Stella had joked that this was her wallet’s unique feature, forcing her to take a moment to think about her spending. Now, it was just getting in the way of her free spending!

【…3, 2, 1! Time’s up!】

“Huh!”

Stella let out a long breath, relieved that she had made it just in time.

In the last three seconds, she managed to open her wallet and pull out two 0.1 yuan coins to complete her payment.

Holding the two lollipops, Stella walked out of the convenience store under the cashier’s incredulous stare.

As the cool night breeze hit her, Stella's overheated brain finally began to cool down.

Well, in order to spend that free 0.1 yuan, she ended up spending an additional 0.2 yuan.
