one hundred and seventy-four chapter

“No problem, I’ll pay.”

A group of people entered an office, and Sister Mi pointed to a young girl lounging on the sofa, reciting her lines. “Look, this is our company’s hottest artist right now, Lin Miaolu. You should have seen her name online. She recently landed a great role, playing the fourth female lead in a major IP drama. The official announcement for this show will be made soon.”

Stella Ling wanted to say that she didn’t know who Lin Miaolu was, but she felt it wasn’t necessary. She activated her Insightful Gaze and looked at the girl practicing her lines.

Her potential score was 8, and the score referred specifically to her looks.

Stella felt a bit disappointed. Did this girl have no other talents related to the entertainment industry?

“Is there anyone else?” Stella tilted her head, looking at Sister Mi.

“Ha! What? Do you think she’s not better than your sister?” Sister Mi crossed her arms and chuckled at Stella.

“What do you mean? My sister isn’t bad-looking either. This difference in looks can easily be made up with makeup,” Stella retorted. 

The entertainment industry isn’t a place where they compete with bare faces; what artist doesn’t wear makeup?

If this artist’s acting could score an 8, she might give her a second glance. But having only looks and no other talents wasn’t what Star Entertainment needed.

Besides, while Lin Miaolu’s face was indeed pretty, it wasn’t stunning. She didn’t have that leading role aura; she looked just averagely good.

Sister Mi smiled after hearing that, thinking that Xu Shujun’s sister really knows how to find excuses to comfort herself.

In the entertainment industry, what doesn’t rely on looks?

Talent?

Don’t be ridiculous!

If you don’t have the looks, who has the patience to watch you showcase your talents?

“There’s only this one debut artist in the company today; the others are busy with gigs. If you’re curious, I can tell you their names, and you can search for them online yourself,” Sister Mi said, her expression filled with impatience.

She initially thought that showing Xu Shujun’s sister their top artist, Lin Miaolu, would make her back down, but she didn’t expect her to be so oblivious.

It seems Xu Shujun doesn’t recognize her own limitations, and wasting so much time in this industry has a lot to do with her family’s pampering.

Hearing Sister Mi say this, Stella felt quite bored.

What a letdown! She had expected to see a lot of promising talents!

Her Insightful Gaze only works when she sees someone in person; it doesn’t provide potential scores for people in videos or photos.

“Do you have any trainees? I’d like to see them, regardless of gender,” Stella said again.

Sister Mi was even more annoyed but nodded in agreement.

“Okay, but what do you want to see them for?” Sister Mi asked curiously. Then she leaned closer to Stella and whispered, “Honestly, the batch of trainees we have left here has no hope of debuting. Their abilities are even worse than your sister’s. It’s no use for you to see them; they aren’t worth comparing.”

If Xu Shujun’s sister sees those trainees and mistakenly thinks her sister is the best, thinking she can continue chasing her dream, wouldn’t that be harming them?

So, she decided to be clear with Xu Shujun’s sister beforehand, letting her know not to hold any expectations for those trainees or her sister.

Stella insisted, saying she still wanted to see the trainees.

At the same time, she felt speechless. 

Was Huaihua Entertainment planning to drag this batch of trainees along until they couldn’t take it anymore and had to pay the termination fees to leave?

The entertainment industry is indeed brutal.

Artists and trainees at the bottom not only earn nothing; to escape from a company that wastes their youth, they have to fork out a significant sum of money.

Stella secretly vowed that she would never do such a heartless thing in the future.

Star Entertainment would only recruit artists with a potential score of 9 and above.

That way, every artist would have gigs lined up after debuting.

Sister Mi’s whispers were overheard by Xu Shujun, who had been following Stella closely.

However, Xu Shujun wasn’t discouraged by what she heard. Stella had always been encouraging her and giving her a lot of confidence.

She just felt unfair for the trainees she had worked hard with.

Besides, wasn’t Fang Yao always saying that she would soon have debut resources?

Hearing Sister Mi’s words, it seemed like there was no plan for any trainees to debut at all…

Stella followed Sister Mi to the dance studio where the trainees practiced.

Huaihua Entertainment had a shared dance studio for both male and female trainees, but their practice times were staggered.

It was currently the female trainees’ lunch break, and the dance studio was occupied by male trainees.

Scores of the male trainees were as follows: 8.1, 6.3, 5.5, 6.6, 7.4, 6.7, 6.5, 7, 7.2, and 8.9.

There were ten male trainees, and none met Star Entertainment’s recruitment standards.

Stella looked regretfully at a boy with an 8.9 score who was dancing earnestly.

Just 0.1 points away!

“Sigh, what a disappointing batch. The good cabbage has all been taken by the big companies,” Sister Mi lamented, watching the group of boys in the dance studio.

She pitied these boys who were wasting time chasing their dreams, and even more so for Huaihua Entertainment, which couldn’t recruit any good artists.

Stella blinked and leaned closer to Sister Mi, whispering, “I think that shaved-head guy and the one in the blue t-shirt are quite good.”

Sister Mi scoffed at this, “No way. Can’t you see that their dancing is terrible? Among these people, those two dance the least in sync!”

Stella countered, “That’s exactly right! Their talents aren’t in dancing!”

Sister Mi was intrigued by Stella’s comment and leaned in to ask, “What do you mean? If dancing isn’t their talent, but they’re also average-looking, what else is there to appreciate?”

If they had no redeeming qualities, why did your company recruit them in the first place?

Stella felt frustrated and pointed at the shaved-head guy, fabricating, “Look at that bald guy. Don’t just focus on his movements; look at his face. His expression makes him seem like the most serious dancer among this group!”

“You only realize how lazy he is in his movements when you look lower. This shows what?”

“What does it show?” Sister Mi was confused, wondering if it meant Tao Xiangtian was a slacker?

“It shows he can act! He has good acting skills!” Stella clapped her hands, looking back at Sister Mi.

The bald guy had a score of 8.1 for acting abilities.

Sister Mi’s expression was one of shock.

Huh? Is that how you determine if someone is a good actor?

Not believing it, Sister Mi stared at Tao Xiangtian’s plain face, and he really did seem to be dancing with more effort than the other trainees in the studio.

But looking lower, his arms and legs clearly weren’t putting in any effort; he wasn’t truly dancing.

Hmm?

Now that she thought about it, Xu Shujun’s sister might have a point.

“What about the other guy? What about Chen Zheng?” Sister Mi asked with growing interest.

“The other one—ha!” Stella started to laugh mid-sentence, leaving Sister Mi puzzled and Xu Shujun looking at her in confusion.

Stella laughed for a while before saying, “I think the guy in the blue t-shirt is really interesting. His dance movements are full of power, yet he gives off a strange vibe. Even though he’s trying hard, he just can’t get it right. Coupled with his serious expression, it’s hilarious!”

“I feel like he has a kind of unintentional contradictory charm. I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s just so funny! I think he’d be perfect as a guest in a comedy variety show; he’d definitely bring laughter to the audience.”

Stella glanced at Chen Zheng, whose score of 8.9 floated above his head for comedic variety skills, and made up her mind.

Whether Sister Mi was influenced or not, the longer she watched Chen Zheng dance, the more she wanted to laugh.

She tried hard to suppress her laughter and continued to ask Stella, “What about the others? Did you see any other talents in them?”

“The others dance pretty well,” Stella replied honestly.

The others all had their potential scores in dancing, but none broke the 8-point mark. Only the bald guy and the one named Chen Zheng had potential scores outside of dancing, and both were above 8.

If these two found the right development path, they should be able to do well in the entertainment industry.

Hearing this, Sister Mi felt a bit disappointed.

Then she realized why she felt disappointed.

Xu Shujun’s sister wasn’t a highly skilled talent scout in the entertainment industry; why should she believe the other person’s words?

Just as Sister Mi was about to retort, Stella said, “Alright, we’ve spent enough time here; we should go pick up your other sister.”

With that, Stella and Xu Shujun quickly left, leaving Sister Mi standing there with wide eyes, looking frustrated.

After stepping out of the elevator, Stella noticed Tian Rui still waiting downstairs, her score hovering above her head.

9.1 points!

A score of 9.1 for jazz dance skills!

Stella’s eyes lit up, and she dashed over to Tian Rui, circling around her to observe.

“What are you doing?”

Tian Rui was startled and asked, “Did you sign the termination contract?”

“Signed it!” Stella replied, then stopped in front of the tall beauty with a smile, inviting, “Teacher Tian, would you be interested in joining us at Star Entertainment with Shujun? I think your qualifications are excellent!”

“Huh?”

Tian Rui was surprised. At 35 years old, she didn’t expect to receive an invitation from an entertainment company.

Instead of feeling happy, she became more suspicious that Stella was a scammer.

“Sorry, I don’t want to be an artist; I just want to teach dancing.”

“I don’t mind if you don’t want to be an artist. You can come to our company to teach artists how to dance. I’ll offer you a salary higher than Huaihua,” Stella quickly stated.

“I won’t sign a long contract; I’ll only sign a short one,” Tian Rui replied.

“No problem. If you think our company is bad, you can leave anytime,” Stella said cheerfully.

Tian Rui felt conflicted. Was this person really not a human trafficker?

Why was she so eager to invite her to the company as a dance teacher?

When they first met, she didn’t seem so desperate for talent.

“Teacher Tian, I want to continue learning dance from you,” Xu Shujun stepped forward to support.

Tian Rui was also reluctant to part with this talented student, and after thinking for a moment, she said to Stella, “Alright, I agree, but I’ll only sign a short contract, and I can’t start at your company until next month. I’m signed to a short contract with Huaihua, and I have to teach here until the end of the month.”

“Sure, no problem. Let’s exchange contact information,” Stella said happily as she took her phone out of her bag.

Although she couldn’t recruit any artists with scores above 9 at Huaihua, she managed to snag a dance teacher with a score above 9.

This trip wasn’t a waste!

After that, Stella temporarily entrusted Xu Shujun to Tian Rui and headed alone toward the direction of the company where Song Mengmeng was, Jieyue Entertainment.

Song Mengmeng’s company was also in Sanlitun SOHO, just in another nearby office building.

Like Xu Shujun, Song Mengmeng was waiting for her downstairs, accompanied by a middle-aged man in a gray suit.

Before Stella approached, the middle-aged man quickly walked up to her, his expression unwavering as he questioned, “You’re the boss of Star Entertainment? You want to poach Song Mengmeng?”

Stella took a step back, her expression wary. “Yes, I want to poach her!”

Seeing Stella’s confident demeanor made the middle-aged man even angrier, and he accused her, “How can you be so unreasonable? Our company has invested so much effort in training Song Mengmeng! You think you can just take her away?”

“Isn’t it just paying the termination fee to take her away?” Stella said, feigning confusion, then chuckling, “I remember Mengmeng joined the company as a trainee, right? Did you really train her?”

The middle-aged man was even angrier, shouting, “Our company is about to arrange for her debut! You come here to steal her away! If you dare to poach her, I’ll let everyone know, and your company will have a hard time in the entertainment industry!”

Stella was taken aback by this and quickly looked at Song Mengmeng, who appeared tense, asking, “Mengmeng, are they really arranging for your debut?”

“Yeah,” Song Mengmeng nodded with a complex expression. She hadn’t expected her company to not give up on her.

Just after Song Mengmeng expressed her desire to terminate the contract, her manager immediately offered her a chance to join a music commentary variety show as a guest singer, hoping she wouldn’t terminate her contract with the company.

“Do you still want to come to Star Entertainment?” Stella asked anxiously.

“Mhm, I’ve already promised you! I won’t go back on my word!” Song Mengmeng nodded firmly, looking resolutely at Stella.

Stella smiled and quickly pulled Song Mengmeng behind her protectively, addressing the increasingly furious middle-aged man, “She doesn’t want to debut with your company; it’s useless to force her. Just sign the termination contract quickly.”

“Ha! You think her termination fee is still 1.5 million?” The middle-aged man laughed in anger, continuing, “To get her on this program, we spent 500,000! If she doesn’t want to stay at Jieyue, then she has to repay us this money! Her termination fee is now 2 million!”

Stella laughed nonchalantly, “Oh, so it only went up by 500,000? No problem, I’ll pay!”

The middle-aged man was left speechless.
