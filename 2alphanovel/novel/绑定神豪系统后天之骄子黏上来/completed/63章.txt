Chapter 1: Journey to Han Country

On the afternoon of July 10th, Stella Ling officially signed the artist contract with Cheng Luyi, who had brought along her parents and family friends to visit the company. 

Initially, Cheng Luyi’s parents were opposed to their daughter entering the entertainment industry. However, after reviewing the contents of the artist contract, they were not as resistant to the idea anymore, particularly because Starry Entertainment was known for treating its artists well compared to other companies. 

Li Miaomiao envied her friend for landing a contract with such a reputable company. She also yearned for a career in the entertainment industry, but she understood that General Ling of Starry Entertainment wasn’t interested in her. Even if she begged Cheng Luyi for help, it might not end well and could potentially tarnish her friend’s reputation in the eyes of General Ling. 

Sigh~  
It seemed like this was just not her fate. 

Noticing her friend’s disappointment, Cheng Luyi held Li Miaomiao’s hand tightly, offering her comfort. She didn’t want to lose this friendship over such matters. 

Sensitive to the emotions around her, Stella Ling sensed Li Miaomiao’s envy towards Cheng Luyi, but the latter's potential in the entertainment industry didn’t score above a 9. Stella had her standards, and she wasn’t about to bend them, not even for someone she believed in like Cheng Luyi. 

Cheng Luyi had her passport, while the other four members of their girl group—Xu Shujun, Song Mengmeng, Faliha, and Yang Yuxiu—had rushed to the immigration office the day before to apply for expedited passports. This morning, their passports had arrived, and together with the other members, they had also applied for their visas to Han Country. 

Later, they would arrange for Cheng Luyi to get her visa, and once they all received their visas tomorrow, they could board a plane and head to the beauty battlefield. 

Stella had already contacted a professional team in Han Country to learn about various cosmetic surgery institutions, spending a significant amount of money. She hoped that this investment would be worth it. 

The next morning, everyone’s visas were ready. In the afternoon, Stella purchased eight plane tickets to Han Country and boarded the flight with the girl group. 

At 5 AM on July 11th, the plane landed promptly at Hanyang Airport in Han Country. After disembarking, Stella encountered staff from Hanmei, the team she had engaged to assist her. 

Hanmei was the professional team Stella had sought out, essentially acting as a middleman introducing various cosmetic surgery institutions to foreign travelers. They were recognized as the most professional cosmetic surgery agency in Han Country; as long as one was willing to pay, they could access all kinds of information about surgery facilities. 

Since Stella and her group were from Huaguo, Hanmei had specially sent staff who spoke Han language to greet them. 

“No need for a translator; I can speak Han language. Let’s go straight to your company,” Stella said in Han language. 

The staff from Hanmei and the Huaguo translator were taken aback upon hearing her speak fluently without any foreign accent. 

Xu Shujun and the others were equally shocked to learn that General Ling could speak Han language! 

“Oh, great! Miss Ling, your Han language is so fluent! You don’t have any foreign accent!” the staff praised. Then he asked, “Are you from the Chaozu ethnic group?” 

“No, I’m Han, not Chaozu,” Stella replied in Han language. 

Upon hearing this, the staff’s impression of Stella skyrocketed! In many Asian countries, people have a good impression of foreigners who speak their language, viewing it as a sign of closeness to their culture. 

In contrast, many Westerners think that foreigners should learn their language when they come to their country, and if they don’t speak well, it’s often met with ridicule. Those who mock usually harbor some discrimination against Asians, showing no genuine respect regardless of the language skills of the foreigner. 

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the headquarters of the Hanmei cosmetic surgery agency. The company was located in the CBD area of Hanyang, within a 200-meter tall building. 

Entering the reception office for high-end clients, Stella immediately took out her phone and expressed to the staff member, “I’d like to find information about the doctors who have performed surgeries on these celebrities. Can you arrange that for me?” 

The staff took the phone with both hands and began scrolling through the photos of the female stars, increasingly realizing that this young woman in front of them was a discerning client. 

The actresses featured in the photos had once been praised as natural beauties upon their debut. However, Han media later exposed that they had all undergone cosmetic surgery, even posting their pre-surgery photos online, shocking audiences both domestically and internationally. 

People exclaimed how natural the transformations were, questioning how they could maintain such beauty for over 20 years without any signs of aging! Who were the surgeons behind these transformations? 

During that period, internet users fervently discussed which hospitals had performed the surgeries, eager to uncover the information so they could also find top-notch facilities. 

As the topic gained traction online, several cosmetic institutions falsely claimed credit for the surgeries, making a fortune, but their deceit would eventually lead to their downfall. 

Clients who had undergone surgeries at these facilities and were dissatisfied with the results banded together to sue, bringing the entire saga to an end. 

“Miss Ling, to be honest, the doctors who performed surgeries on these celebrities are quite old now and can no longer operate,” the staff member explained. 

Stella was taken aback, but she quickly realized that this must be the case. The celebrities in the photos were from the previous century, and the surgeons who had worked on them were likely retired or unable to perform surgery due to age-related conditions. 

“Are there any doctors with similar skills and aesthetic sensibility?” Stella inquired. 

The staff proceeded to introduce a few surgeons to Stella according to her request. However, Stella was not entirely convinced and relied on her keen insight to judge their capabilities. 

She then asked the staff, “Can you arrange for these doctors to meet with me, preferably all at once?” 

“Uh…” The staff member hesitated, knowing that these surgeons were top figures at their respective hospitals and that arranging for them to meet together was no small feat. 

As the saying goes, “colleagues are rivals.” 

“If it’s inconvenient to meet all at once, I can meet them one by one,” Stella suggested. 

“…Alright, we will arrange that for you,” the staff member replied after a moment of consideration. 

The staff, Jin Dongxu, found Stella to be both picky and peculiar. Typically, clients would go directly to the recommended hospitals for consultations after receiving their suggestions. 

Stella, however, insisted on meetings, which would only add to the expenses. “Huaguo people really have money,” he thought. 

After arranging accommodations for Xu Shujun and the others at a nearby hotel, Stella headed to the nearest duty-free shop, intending to buy some gifts for the surgeons she was about to meet. 

A little gift can go a long way in business, after all. 

Upon entering the duty-free store, Stella heard the familiar voice of her Celestial Fortune System echo in her mind. 

【Today's daily task: Spend 100,000 yuan within 30 minutes.】  
【Random task triggered: Spend 25 million yuan within 8 hours.】  
【Stella, buy more snacks from Han country; I want to eat!】 

“Okay!” Stella replied with a smile. 

She headed straight to the liquor section of the duty-free store, planning to prepare some Huaguo specialties for the upcoming meetings with the surgeons. 

Speaking of liquor, it seemed that Moutai was quite renowned in Han country. In fact, it was famous worldwide, and its market value even made American beverage companies envious. 

Stella selected five bottles of the 2,929 yuan Moutai and five bottles of 2,000 yuan brandy, knowing that spirits like brandy were also quite popular in Han country. 

With the remaining funds from her daily task, Stella bought a variety of snacks and a few summer outfits at a clothing store. 

In the afternoon, Stella scheduled meetings with the five surgeons at different times, but she only presented gifts to two of them. 

Among the five surgeons, only two met her standards: one specialized in double eyelid procedures and the other in nose surgeries. These two were rated as top-level surgeons by her discerning eye, while the other three were classified as mid-level. 

The top-level designation was the highest that her insight could detect, followed by mid-level, then junior, and finally the lowest level. 

After meeting with the five surgeons, Stella informed the Hanmei staff that she was dissatisfied with three of them and requested they introduce her to an authority in fill-and-wrinkle procedures, stating that she did not require introductions for jawline or cheekbone surgeries. 

Stella had previously made it clear that she wasn’t planning on allowing her girl group members to undergo any bone surgeries. If the flaws in their noses were minor, a slight adjustment might be acceptable, but extensive bone shaving or jawline cutting was absolutely out of the question! 

The staff member initially found Stella to be overly picky, as he believed the surgeons he had recommended were all highly skilled. However, after Stella gifted him two bottles of fine liquor before leaving, he was more than willing to assist her in finding a wrinkle-filling expert. 

By the end of the day, Stella had spent 24,975,000 yuan from the random task budget, with three hours remaining on the task timer. 

She considered that when inviting the surgeons for the surgeries, she would likely need to present more gifts to ensure they would go above and beyond in making the girl group members look perfect. 

Moreover, the post-operative care of the girl group members would undoubtedly rely on these doctors, so it was crucial for her to place importance on their relationships. 

Thus, she decided to purchase additional gifts. 

The next day, Stella met with two more surgeons and finally found one who was a top-level expert in fill-and-wrinkle procedures. 

In the afternoon, she brought the prepared gifts and arranged to meet the three surgeons she favored at a high-end Western restaurant. 

Initially, the three surgeons were displeased to learn that Stella had scheduled a meeting with all of them at once. However, upon seeing the gifts she had brought, their irritation vanished, and they silently vowed to take good care of this valuable client. 

That evening, Dr. Li whistled as he returned home, handing the gifts he had received from Stella to his wife as soon as he stepped inside. 

“Why are you so generous today, buying me gifts?” 

His wife exclaimed with delight, eagerly unwrapping the gifts in front of him. 

“Wow! It’s a jewelry set from Xiang Nai Nai, and a bag!” 

After her surprise, she opened another package, revealing a branded wallet, tie clip, and cufflinks. 

“Oh my heavens!” 

His wife was astounded, pointing at the gifts and exclaiming, “These must be worth at least 300 million Han yuan! Honey, what’s gotten into you? Spending so much money!” 

Dr. Li, annoyed by her words, quickly replied, “What do you mean ‘what’s gotten into me’? These are gifts from a client!” 

“Oh my gosh! A client?” 

His wife gasped, leaning closer with excitement, “Is it the daughter of an executive from Sanxing Group looking for a double eyelid surgery?” 

“Impossible! Sanxing only knows how to make money off us; why would they give me such expensive things?” 

Dr. Li rolled his eyes, then proudly raised his chin, “No, it’s a big client from Huaguo who appreciates my skills and wants me to help her friends with their double eyelid surgery.” 

“Ah! A big boss from Huaguo! No wonder the gifts are so generous!” 

His wife suddenly understood, urging him, “You must take good care of this client! Make sure to treat her friends as well as you treated me when I got my double eyelid surgery!” 

“...Got it.” 

Dr. Li replied, somewhat speechless. 

Thinking back to when he had performed the surgery on his wife, he felt a twinge of frustration. 

He had offered to introduce her to a highly skilled colleague for her surgery, but she insisted on having him do it, so he felt uncomfortable every time he looked at her double eyelids now. 

He definitely had a psychological shadow regarding this. 

His wife gleefully held up a Xiang Nai Nai jewelry necklace, positioning it around her neck and cheerfully asking, “Honey, does it look good?” 

“...It looks good,” Dr. Li replied. 

On the third day in Han Country, Stella brought Xu Shujun and the others to a cosmetic surgery hospital and headed straight to the office of the hospital's director. 

In the office, in addition to the hospital's director, there were also surgeons from two other cosmetic surgery hospitals, and the other doctors in the hospital found this to be quite an extraordinary situation. 

It seemed they had no cooperative relationship with the other two hospitals, right?
