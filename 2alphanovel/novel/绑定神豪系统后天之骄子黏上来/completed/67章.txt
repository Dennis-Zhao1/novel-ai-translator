**Official Debut**

In the blink of an eye, 51 days had passed.

During this nearly two-month span, Stella Ling had completed a total of 51 daily tasks, 8 weekly tasks, 2 monthly tasks, and 5 random tasks, amassing a staggering 865.1 million yuan in task funds. 

Throughout this period, Stella had also won two cash prizes from the system's lottery, amounting to 10 million and 50 million yuan, respectively. Additionally, she received two physical rewards in the form of black gold cards with 5 minutes of usage rights each, as well as four formulas for skincare products: a blackhead removal cleanser, an acne gel, a spot-fading essence, and a whitening and moisturizing mask. 

There was also a physical reward for a quick-cook snail noodle recipe, a year-long subscription to the Insightful Eye service, a permanent usage card for a laptop that connects to parallel dimensions, and even a retired special forces soldier as her bodyguard, who came with identification from this world - all classified as tangible rewards.

The retired soldier, named Jiang Feng, was a real person living in this world. Stella had hired him as her bodyguard for a monthly salary of 300,000 yuan. Since this was a physical reward drawn from the system's lottery, his salary was actually covered by the Celestial Fortune System. 

The most crucial point was that Jiang Feng would be utterly loyal to Stella, never betraying her trust. The Celestial Fortune System had specifically assured Stella that this bodyguard was exceedingly capable and would ensure her safety from all angles. 

Since Stella didn't have to pay Jiang Feng's salary out of her own pocket and he wasn't one of the Heaven’s Chosen Ones, she was more than happy to have such a talent by her side, especially as her assets were steadily increasing.

To further ensure the safety of her company and its artists, Stella had also recruited a batch of retired soldier bodyguards through Jiang Feng's introduction. While this new group might not match Jiang Feng's prowess, they were more than adequate for maintaining the security of the company and its artists.

With the help of the laptop connecting to parallel dimensions, Stella had already uncovered three popular songs by a Chinese girl group from that alternate reality and had her company's music producer recreate these songs. 

Now named the "Big Dipper" girl group, under the guidance of vocal coach Liang Jingjing, the seven members had learned these three songs and were also mastering the choreography designed by dance instructor Tian Rui. 

In the luxurious 5,000-square-meter indoor sports hall located in the high-tech zone of Rong City, construction had rushed ahead day and night at Stella’s financial urging, and it was completed a full two weeks ahead of schedule. 

The Big Dipper girl group had been rehearsing intensely for one week within the opulent sports hall, focusing on one of their songs. 

Today marked the official debut of the Big Dipper girl group, and Xu Shujun and the seven members were all feeling the pressure. 

Fortunately, today’s debut would be broadcasted through television and online platforms, so they wouldn't have to face a live audience, otherwise, they were genuinely worried about messing up during the filming.

“Go for it! You’re all the best!” 

As the time for the official filming drew near, Stella could only manage to say this one encouraging line to the nervous girl group members, as she too was feeling the jitters.

The filming was set to take place at 8 PM tonight, simultaneously broadcasting on Mango TV and three live streaming platforms: Douyin, B Station, and Weibo. 

Stella had spent a huge sum on advertisements across these platforms for over half a month, and tonight would be the moment of truth.

“You’re the best too!” 

Suddenly, Tian Rui, who stood beside Stella, placed a hand on her left shoulder. 

With a smile in her eyes, Tian Rui looked at Stella. 

Initially, Tian Rui had doubted that the woman before her could provide a bright future for Xu Shujun. However, ever since Stella presented those three songs, she had completely acknowledged Stella’s capabilities and had no remaining doubts. 

Tian Rui believed that the Big Dipper girl group, meticulously crafted by Stella, would become an overnight sensation tonight.

“Thank you!” 

Stella replied gratefully, yet her heart was still racing with anxiety. 

Even if the live broadcast didn’t achieve the expected results, she planned to buy trending topics frantically tonight, using money to ensure that the online community knew about the existence of the Big Dipper!

Meanwhile, Xu Shujun's father, Xu Bin, was lounging on the sofa in front of the television. 

Every day, Xu Bin would tune in at 7 PM to watch the news broadcast, followed by the weather report. After that, he would relinquish the remote to his wife, allowing her to indulge in her favorite soap operas. 

However, after watching the weather report today, Xu Bin inexplicably lingered in place, changing the channel to his wife's favorite Mango TV. 

Just as Wang Jia, who had just finished showering, entered the living room, she couldn’t help but chuckle upon seeing her husband still seated on the sofa.

Wang Jia watched as her husband, who clearly wanted to watch their daughter perform but was trying to play it cool, decided not to call him out on his pretense. 

Thinking back to the video call with Shujun two days ago, where she mentioned signing with a new entertainment company and had even undergone cosmetic surgery, Wang Jia felt a mix of happiness and worry. She wondered if her daughter had taken out a loan for the surgery and if this new company might pressure her into doing things she didn't want to do.

As if reading her mind, Xu Bin voiced his concerns bluntly. 

Sure enough, the father-daughter pair had a heated argument through video call. However, this time, Shujun didn’t hang up mid-fight; instead, she shared details about her new entertainment company once her father had calmed down.

Xu Bin’s expression softened considerably when he heard that their daughter had signed a five-year contract and that the company’s owner was a woman only a few years older than Shujun, who was friendly and kind. 

Upon learning that the company had covered Shujun’s cosmetic surgery expenses without her having incurred any debt, Wang Jia felt a wave of relief wash over her.

Soon, the couple learned that their daughter would be debuting on television in just two days, and they couldn't help but feel excited.

Their daughter, Shujun, was truly going to be on television, becoming a star!

Wang Jia wanted to rush to share the good news with their eldest daughter, Xu Jingyuan, who was working far away in Hu City, but she found out that Shujun had already informed her sister long ago.

Wang Jia felt a twinge of jealousy; her youngest daughter seemed to have a better relationship with her older sister than with her. Still, her heart swelled with joy for Shujun. 

At last, Shujun was going to fulfill her dream and step onto the stage!

After that phone call, Xu Bin awkwardly insisted that he wasn’t interested in watching any debut performances. 

Yet as 8 PM approached, signaling the start of their daughter’s televised performance, he was already grumbling to himself about being forced to watch it.

Wang Jia sat down next to Xu Bin, clearly sensing his discomfort. She stifled her laughter, choosing to treat her husband like air, allowing him to squirm in his own awkwardness.

Li Miaomiao was glued to her phone, anxiously watching the countdown. 

There was only one minute left until her friend Cheng Luyi’s debut performance was about to begin, and she was determined to support her on time. 

As the seconds ticked down from 59 to 00, Li Miaomiao quickly clicked into the Douyin livestream titled "Xingchen Entertainment." 

Upon entering, she was greeted by darkness, which slowly faded away to reveal seven stylishly dressed girls standing still on a dazzling stage.

Suddenly, seven beams of light shot down from above, illuminating the seven girls on stage.

Then, the beautiful sound of the erhu began to play. The previously motionless girls seemed to come alive, moving rhythmically to the vibrant beats of jazz drums and electric guitars.

Stepping forward to the center was Cheng Luyi, who began to sing:

“Laugh, just sing,
One frown brings heartache.”

Next, Feng Xiaocong stepped up, moving her body as she harmonized:

“I have no time to care for myself,
Only feeling your feelings.”

Xu Shujun sang:

“Where are you going,
Taking my soul along?”

Song Mengmeng followed:

“It’s enchanted by you,
What’s the use of holding onto it?”

As the song reached its climax, the seven girls raised their hands, pointing forward, dancing and singing in unison:

“You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.”

Following the chorus, the girls danced in perfect synchronization, shifting formations.

It was Yang Yuxiu’s turn as she stepped into the center, singing:

“Hands are not just hands,
They are the gentle universe.”

Faliha chimed in:

“My little planet,
Spins in your hands.”

Park Haneun added:

“Please see me,
Let me have dreams to chase.”

The high notes were still sung by Song Mengmeng:

“I've lost my mind for you,
You must reward me.”

Again, the synchronized girl group sang together:

“You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.”

With a change in choreography, Park Haneun stepped to the front and sang:

“You are the meaning,
Heaven and earth, the will of the gods.”

Then quickly shifting, Song Mengmeng took center stage, singing:

“Besides loving you,
There is no truth.”

Cheng Luyi and Yang Yuxiu sang a duet:

“Fire, you are fire,
The end for my moth.”

Feng Xiaocong and Faliha followed with their duet:

“I never thought to escape,
Why should I escape?”

Xu Shujun and Park Haneun sang together:

“Thank you for giving me
A joyful dream journey.”

Song Mengmeng concluded:

“If I forget myself,
Please help me remember.”

They all joined in for the final chorus:

“You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.
You are the lightning, you are the light,
You are the only myth.
I only love you,
You are my superstar.
You reign, I worship,
There’s no better way,
I can only love you,
You are my superstar.”

Song Mengmeng finished with a flourish:

“You are my superstar boy!”

As the song came to an end, the seven girls stood in a row, bowing at a 90-degree angle towards the camera.

Li Miaomiao felt goosebumps cover her body. 

She had a strong premonition that this girl group, the Big Dipper, was destined for stardom, and her friend Cheng Luyi would skyrocket to fame!

Even though the livestream had ended, the comments section remained flooded with messages.

“Oh my god! I’m going crazy! Are these seven girls angels sent to save my eyes and ears?”

“I suddenly feel like I have no regrets in life.”

“This is the best stage performance I’ve seen this year; whether it’s the songs, the dances, or the camera work, everything is just fantastic!”

“Is Chinese entertainment about to rise?”

“Wait, didn’t one of them look like a foreigner?”

“That’s not a foreigner! She’s a Uyghur girl from Zhuzhou; she’s one of us! The Douyin ad had her introduction; her name is Faliha Reheimu!”

“Wow! I used to be annoyed with Xingchen Entertainment for their ads everywhere! Now I get it! This company is amazing! Thank goodness they advertised so much; if I had missed tonight’s livestream, I would have regretted it for life!”

“I remember Xingchen Entertainment was recruiting artists a few months ago; it's only been a short time, and those who auditioned are already performing? This company is incredible!”

“I should have auditioned! I also want to stand on that stage!”

“I heard it’s hard to get selected; many who went for interviews complained online that the interviewers were super picky, harder than any talent show!”

“Guess I’ll just enjoy watching these beautiful girls perform!”

“Why is there only one performance? I want to see more!”

“Everyone hurry! Xingchen Entertainment has posted a recording of the livestream on Douyin; go watch it!”

“Ah! I’m going to watch!”

Stella Ling watched as the comments began to slow down. She let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding.

By now, she hadn’t seen a single negative review.

Could it be that the Big Dipper girl group's debut performance was a success?

She turned her gaze back to the stage, where Xu Shujun was crouched down, holding her phone and crying, while the other members comforted her with teary eyes.

“The stage performance was a great success! You’re all the best!” 

Stella shouted excitedly towards the stage.

Upon hearing her words, Xu Shujun stopped crying, and along with the other members, rushed off the stage to envelop their boss in a joyful embrace, tears mingling with laughter as they shared this moment of elation.

That night was destined to be an insomniac’s night.

The trending topics about Xingchen Entertainment's Big Dipper girl group skyrocketed across major online platforms.

Initially, the entertainment company had planned to buy the top trending spot, spending a hefty sum to try and push Xingchen Entertainment off the number one position, but they failed miserably.

Other entertainment companies could only watch helplessly as Xingchen Entertainment soared to the top of all platforms.

Song Mengmeng's former manager, Yuan Keping, glared at the top trending topic on Weibo, unable to hold back his frustration. “Damn it, they really have money!”

Even with several entertainment companies teaming up to suppress them, Xingchen Entertainment firmly held the number one trending spot. Remembering how that young woman had swiftly paid the termination fee, Yuan Keping couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness.

He had truly believed in Song Mengmeng's potential, but a poor company like Jieyue probably wouldn’t have the funds to produce any quality music for her. 

Sigh, perhaps it was for the best.
