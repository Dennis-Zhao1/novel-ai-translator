**Newbie Gift Pack Unlocked**

Stella Ling didn’t have to worry about the secret of the Celestial Fortune System being exposed, as the shimmering golden wheel in front of her could only be seen by the system's host. 

The prize wheel was neatly divided into eight segments, each representing a different prize. Four of those segments were cash rewards, but the exact amounts were unspecified, only labeled with the words “Random Cash.” The remaining four segments included one random skill reward, also without any specific details, simply marked as “Random Skill,” along with three physical prizes: a discount coupon for King Fried Chicken at 90% off, a discount coupon for DeKe's Fried Chicken at 90% off, and a free family bucket coupon for KFC.

As Stella's gaze landed on the three segments representing coupon rewards, her eyelids twitched. She suddenly recalled the fried chicken leg she had for lunch today. 

In her mind, she raised a small hand to report: “Report! I suspect the system is rigged! It added options that shouldn’t exist to the prize draw!”

【Cough! Don’t talk nonsense! This system is the fairest and most just entity around, and would never cheat!】

Stella felt a wave of exasperation, which condensed into a single word: “Oh.”

【Hehe, then hurry up and draw your reward!】

Hearing the system’s impatient tone, Stella could already guess what prize she would land on. 

With a click, she initiated the draw, and after a flurry of spinning, the golden pointer came to a halt right where she expected—on the physical reward segment for the KFC family bucket free coupon. 

That works too! She hadn’t quite gotten enough of that fried chicken leg at lunch, so dinner would be a family bucket.

“System, do you think I should get a small or a large family bucket?” Stella asked as she followed the system's instructions to download the KFC app on her phone. Once registered, she indeed received an electronic coupon for a free family bucket that she could redeem for either a small or large size.

【Of course, the large one is the better deal! If you can’t finish it, this system can help you out!】

The system enthusiastically suggested. 

Stella couldn’t help but laugh at the greedy system and nodded inwardly, “You’re right, let’s go for the large one then.”

【Yay!】 

【Oh, I almost forgot! I haven’t sent you your newbie gift pack yet!】

【The newbie gift pack reward consists of another draw! You can spin the wheel again!】

Stella was pleasantly surprised: “Is there such a good thing?”

Then she recalled the beginning of the few novels she had skimmed online about the Celestial Fortune System, where the protagonists received a newbie gift pack after binding to the system. 

However, Stella felt that this newbie gift pack was a reward added in because she had decided to redeem the large family bucket, and the system was in a good mood…

The golden wheel reappeared before her eyes, this time divided into sixteen segments. Eight of those segments were random cash rewards, two were random skill rewards, and six were physical prizes. 

This time, there were no more fried chicken discount coupons among the physical prizes. Instead, they included an Apple phone, a tablet, a laptop, a solar-powered electric bike, a mini car from the Five Ling brand, and a set of 20-square-meter apartments located in the Haidian District of the capital.

Seeing that there was even a house in the prize pool, Stella’s eyes lit up instantly. 

At that moment, her focus was solely on the segment that represented the property reward. If she could win that, she wouldn’t have to worry about renting a place anymore! 

Although the apartment was only 20 square meters, it was enough for Stella to live comfortably. Plus, it was located within the fifth ring road of the capital, meaning it would cost at least 500,000 yuan, and if the location was prime, it could easily surpass a million!

Housing prices in the capital of China were notoriously high! 

Stella’s heart raced with excitement as she clicked to draw, her mind filled with anticipation as she awaited the result. 

What she didn’t know was that every move she made was being watched by a young man nearby. 

Li Qicheng knew that his actions were inappropriate, even bordering on creepy. But he just couldn’t help himself. 

Ever since he had curiously picked up the binoculars that morning, that charming silhouette had been etched into his mind, refusing to fade away. 

He spent the entire day unable to focus on work, like a voyeur, constantly using the binoculars to track her movements across the street. 

Unfortunately, that captivating figure had only appeared clearly once, and for the rest of the time, she was blocked by a girl in a pink dress with curly hair, which drove Li Qicheng into a state of frustration. 

At first, he had been grateful to the girl in the pink dress. If she hadn’t stood there like a pink Christmas tree, drawing his attention, he would never have picked up the binoculars and had that fateful encounter. 

However, the subsequent actions of the girl in the pink dress quickly erased any gratitude he felt. 

She spent the entire time obstructing his view of the person he was interested in, allowing him to only catch glimpses of her outstretched arms, which only served to irritate him further. 

It felt like watching his favorite movie in a private theater, only to have his annoying little nephew burst in and start jumping around in front of him, ruining the experience. 

No, compared to the nephew, the girl in the pink dress was far more annoying! 

After enduring a whole morning of this, Li Qicheng instructed his assistant to investigate the company located on the twelfth floor of the office building across the street during lunch. 

Once he found out that the company was a Ha'n enterprise, he started to worry about whether his family would support an international marriage, fearing that the girl he was interested in might be from Ha'n. 

Fortunately, she wasn’t. 

She was a Chinese national, a graduate of Beijing Foreign Studies University, and worked at that company as a Chinese-Ha’n translator. 

This educational background… 

Li Qicheng frowned slightly. 

It wasn’t that he looked down on her education; Beijing Foreign Studies University was a prestigious institution in China, and getting into it was quite an achievement. 

But ultimately, it was still considered ‘good’ in the eyes of ordinary people. 

If they were to be together, she at least needed to have a doctoral degree to minimize the resistance from his family. 

Wait a minute! 

What was he doing?! 

They didn’t even know each other yet, so why was he thinking so far ahead? 

Or rather, it was only he who knew this girl named Stella Ling, as her personal resume was currently in his hands. 

However, if she had seen the recent issue of “China Times” magazine or followed the financial news online, she might already know who he was. 

What kind of impression would she have of him? 

Would she think of him as someone she could trust with her life? 

At this thought, Li Qicheng felt his cheeks flush. 

He had imagined countless scenarios for their future, from choosing the wedding venue to how many children they would have, and even settled on a name for one of them. 

After daydreaming all day, Li Qicheng decided to leave work early and parked his car in front of the office building across the street. 

At 5:03 PM, while sitting in his car and keeping an eye on the outside, he immediately spotted Stella Ling, who was blending in with the crowd of people leaving work. 

To him, Stella was aptly named, shining like the brightest star in the night sky, easily visible among the throng of people. 

Li Qicheng initially thought of following her in his car, but to his surprise, Stella crossed the street and headed straight for his office building. 

His heart raced at the thought—had she discovered him spying on her with the binoculars? 

Was she coming to meet him? Were they about to get to know each other?

His heart raced like a startled deer. 

Then he saw Stella unexpectedly turn and walk toward a shopping center owned by the Li family. 

Li Qicheng felt deflated immediately. 

He didn’t have time to untangle the convoluted path of his emotions and quickly got out of the car, crossing the street to follow her into the Jinghua Guomao shopping center. 

He trailed her to the third floor, stopping only when Stella entered a store. 

Li Qicheng wanted to follow her inside to observe her up close, but it was a lingerie store! 

He didn’t want to give Stella a bad impression, so he had to wait outside. 

However, it didn’t take long for Li Qicheng to realize that he couldn’t even stand outside properly. 

He discovered that the surrounding area was filled with lingerie shops! 

Several female customers passing by shot him incredulous looks, making Li Qicheng feel embarrassed.
