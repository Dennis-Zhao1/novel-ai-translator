**Love Incapacity**

Yang Dan watched as Wang Lingling strolled towards them, adopting a deadpan expression. She glanced around and noticed her two roommates sporting looks that suggested their good mood had been ruined. With a sly grin, she proposed, “Why don’t we make a run for it? It’s such a nice day, and we have to deal with Wang Lingling, the drama queen. Don’t you guys think that’s bad luck?”

Regardless of whether Wang Lingling was there to recite her melodramatic quotes or to bury the hatchet with a smile on graduation day, Stella Ling and her friends wanted nothing to do with her. 

After forming a united front, they all turned in unison and sprinted towards the sports hall where the graduation ceremony would soon take place, leaving Wang Lingling behind, exasperatedly calling their names.

“Look at her! She’s definitely looking for trouble! Good thing we got out of there fast!” Yang Dan exclaimed proudly as they ran.

“Are you not afraid Wang Lingling will tell everyone we bullied her in front of the classmates?” Liu Lu asked, her voice lighthearted as she ran.

“Let her report us! We’re graduating anyway! As long as she doesn’t mind the hassle, she can go straight to the dean or principal!” Yang Dan shrugged, nonchalant.

She remembered how, during their freshman year, because of some discord in their dorm, Wang Lingling had reported them to the counselor, badmouthing them in front of the other classmates. That was when Yang Dan first realized how treacherous people could be. She had been so furious that she had marched up to Wang Lingling, grabbing her and demanding they confront the dean. Thankfully, the counselor had intervened just in time; otherwise, Yang Dan, who had never experienced such unfairness, would have ended up in a fierce showdown with the drama queen.

Now, however, Yang Dan had come to terms with it and was no longer as impulsive as she had been in her first year. She realized that engaging with someone like Wang Lingling only allowed her to play the victim and gain sympathy from others, turning the tables on any legitimate grievances they might have.

Having learned this lesson the hard way, Yang Dan was relieved when the dormitory isolation incident was later cleared up, proving it was a baseless rumor and allowing their classmates to see Wang Lingling’s true nature. Otherwise, she might have let her temper get the better of her and ended up arguing with classmates who didn’t know the truth, potentially ruining friendships even if she won the argument.

The trio of Stella, Yang Dan, and Liu Lu continued chatting and laughing until they arrived at the sports hall. Once the graduation ceremony officially began, they set aside their playful banter and eagerly awaited their turn to receive their diplomas.

After collecting their certificates and snapping graduation photos, they gathered together, admiring other students who were being showered with bouquets from their family and friends.

Yang Dan and Liu Lu, being from out of town, couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy seeing local students celebrating with their loved ones. Stella, who was an orphan, also felt a longing as she watched the joyful scenes unfold.

Some students, though from afar, received flowers from their boyfriends or girlfriends. The popular girls were practically buried under heaps of bouquets and gifts.

During their four years at university, only Liu Lu and Wang Lingling had dated, but both relationships ended in heartbreak. After breaking up with her senior in her second year, Liu Lu became a recluse, preferring to stay in their dorm, binge-watching melodramatic dramas with Yang Dan during breaks.

Yang Dan, on the other hand, seemed completely uninterested in romance. While she would get excited seeing handsome boys, she never initiated anything nor did she entertain anyone's advances.

The two girls exuded an air of loneliness, their eyes green with envy as they watched their peers receive flowers. One thought, after her breakup in her second year, she should really find another boyfriend, just to avoid being left empty-handed at graduation. The other mused that if she had just hired a classmate to run errands for her yesterday, they could have bought her flowers today, so she wouldn’t feel so sour.

What a blunder! They were completely unaware of the flower-giving tradition!

【Today’s daily mission is out: spend 10,000 yuan within 30 minutes!】
【Congratulations, Stella! You’ve bound a cute Celestial Fortune for a month!】
【Monthly task released: spend 50 million yuan within 12 hours!】

Stella perked up, realizing that without even noticing, she had been together with Celestial Fortune for a month! Time flies!

Turning to Yang Dan and Liu Lu, she instructed, “I need to step away for a bit; I’ll be back soon, so make sure to wait for me!”

Without giving them a chance to respond, she dashed off.

When her friends saw her again, she was struggling to carry several bouquets of various colors. As it was clear Stella was having a hard time, Yang Dan and Liu Lu rushed over to help, only to hear their roommate buried under the flowers exclaim, “The two green-packaged bouquets over there are for you guys! Hurry and take them; I can barely hold on!”

Overjoyed and touched by Stella’s thoughtfulness, Yang Dan and Liu Lu eagerly accepted the bouquets. The flowers, consisting of eleven champagne roses, two lilies, and gardenia leaves, were wrapped in double-sided green artificial paper with a cream satin ribbon. 

To express her gratitude for the care her two roommates had given her during their four years together, Stella had specifically chosen this bouquet named “Deep Affection.”

Yang Dan and Liu Lu were immensely moved and wanted to buy Stella a bouquet in return, but she insisted they each take a flower from their bouquets to give her instead.

After that, Stella asked them to help her deliver the remaining pink carnations to their teachers, to which they happily agreed.

Aside from her roommates, Stella was most grateful to the several instructors from the Language Department who had looked after her during these four years.

Not far away, Wang Lingling glared at Stella, her expression filled with resentment as she watched her show off.

Hmph, buying flowers for teachers to show off your abilities, huh! What’s there to be proud of?

After delivering the bouquets and receiving heartfelt thanks from her roommates and teachers, Stella felt elated. She had thought the day would be filled with joy, until one person’s appearance changed everything.

“Stella! Happy birthday! Congratulations on your graduation!” Lu Mingxu suddenly appeared out of nowhere, presenting her with a large bouquet of pink champagne roses.

As Stella stared at the bouquet, unwelcome memories flooded back. The last time she was at the dormitory building, Lu Mingxu had also brought her roses of a similar color.

To avoid drawing attention again, as she had last time when surrounded by onlookers, Stella quickly signaled for Lu Mingxu to follow her to a quieter place.

Lu Mingxu cheerfully nodded and followed her to a nearby area on the campus that was less crowded—the school playground.

Lu Mingxu extended the bouquet towards Stella again, and when she didn’t take it, he grinned broadly, revealing a dazzling smile, and presented her with a beautifully wrapped gift box. “Stella, this is a birthday gift for you.”

“...My birthday isn’t today,” Stella replied wearily.

“That can’t be right! Last time at the police...”

Lu Mingxu abruptly stopped, fearing mentioning the word “police” would remind Stella of unpleasant memories.

But he had no idea that the mere sight of his face triggered all those terrible experiences in the karaoke bar for Stella.

“You saw my ID information,” Stella stated flatly, then explained, “I only celebrate my lunar birthday, which has already passed this year, and the date on my ID is the solar birthday.”

In truth, ever since her grandmother passed away, Stella hadn’t celebrated her birthday. She found that celebrating alone only brought back painful memories of her loved ones, reminding her of her loneliness.

Stella disliked celebrating her birthday or any holiday that called for family togetherness; she could never justify spending money on such occasions.

The arrival of Celestial Fortune had alleviated her feelings of isolation and eased her financial struggles, making her less averse to celebrating holidays.

However, after binding with Celestial Fortune, she hadn’t thought of properly celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival, partly due to work commitments and partly because she simply didn’t want to.

If it hadn’t been for Celestial Fortune expressing a desire to eat zongzi that day, Stella would have treated it like any other day.

As for checking the calendar to remember her lunar birthday, after nearly ten years of neglecting birthdays, Stella had long forgotten about them.

“Well then, this is a gift to celebrate your graduation!” Lu Mingxu quickly amended.

“Thanks, but I don’t want it,” Stella replied coolly, firmly rejecting him.

Lu Mingxu looked crestfallen, gazing into Stella’s eyes, he managed a bitter smile. “Why not? Can’t you at least consider me a friend and accept this gift?”

“We’re not friends, and I don’t want to be friends with you,” Stella stated bluntly.

“Why can’t we be friends? Is it because I confessed to you awkwardly last time and upset you?” 

“That incident was indeed my fault. I’m sorry!” 

“I’m trying to work on my flaws. If I’ve done something wrong, can you please tell me? I want to improve.”

Lu Mingxu gazed at Stella with gentle eyes, his tone sincere.

Feeling the sincerity in his gaze made Stella’s heart feel a bit heavy, and she struggled to find words to say something harsh.

After all, in his pursuit of her, Lu Mingxu hadn’t done anything wrong; it was merely a case of bad luck.

Yet knowing the cause of Lu Mingxu’s feelings, Stella was acutely aware that she must not give him any false hope.

Not only did she not like him, but even if she did, Stella wouldn’t allow herself to forfeit her dignity and dive into the false emotions that came with bad luck.

After considering her words carefully, she looked at Lu Mingxu and slowly said, “You like me, don’t you?”

As a seasoned player in the realm of romance, Lu Mingxu had seen it all—flirtation, affection, and declarations of love. 

He had never uttered sweet words to his partners; instead, it was often the women who would say sweet nothings in an attempt to win him over.

He had encountered all sorts of passionate, bold, and subtly affectionate declarations, but hearing this straightforward statement from Stella caused him to blush uncontrollably, a feeling he had never experienced before.

Lu Mingxu attempted to deny it, but Stella interrupted, “Don’t give me that line about a friendship confession. Have you ever seen anyone make friends like that?”

Lu Mingxu was at a loss for words, his flimsy excuse exposed, leaving him wishing he could hide his face behind the bouquet.

Stella continued, “Thank you for your feelings, but I really can’t accept you.”

“I’m someone who’s love-incapable, not because I’ve been hurt in love, but because I have a natural aversion to it. This isn’t an excuse to reject you; it’s the truth. I’m so averse to love that I don’t plan on getting married in this lifetime.”

“So I’m sorry, please don’t disrupt my life anymore. If you keep pursuing me, it’ll make me feel like a clown, and I really can’t endure my aversion any longer.”

Stella spoke apologetically.

Lu Mingxu’s face turned pale, and the bouquet he was holding fell to the ground, scattering a few pink petals around his feet.

Does she really despise him this much?

What is this love incapacity?

Could it be an excuse?

Could it be?

Lu Mingxu couldn’t believe there was such a thing as love incapacity in the world.

If that were true, why did the woman he liked have to be love-incapable?

Not just Lu Mingxu, but even Yang Dan and Liu Lu, who had followed them to the playground and eavesdropped on the conversation, were utterly shocked, their minds racing with the revelation.

So Stella is love-incapable?

They had thought Stella hadn’t dated during university simply because she was busy with her studies and work.

But the fundamental reason turned out to be a psychological issue.

Stella isn’t averse to men; she simply hates love.

How convoluted.

Feeling a little guilty, Stella realized that her claim of being love-incapable was merely a ploy to deflect Lu Mingxu.

However, she truly had no intention of dating or marrying anyone in this lifetime.

Part of it was to keep the Celestial Fortune system a secret.

The closest relationship in the world is marriage; who could guarantee that they could keep all their secrets in front of the person they would be spending their life with?

Besides, Celestial Fortune couldn’t possibly pretend to be an ordinary cat in front of a future partner forever, could it?

Even if Celestial Fortune could endure that, Stella wouldn’t allow it to suffer.

The other reason was because of the Heaven’s Chosen Ones.

Stella suspected that even if she did get married, some extreme personalities among the Heaven’s Chosen Ones would never let her go.

If that were the case, the constant harassment would surely disrupt her marriage, so it was better not to marry at all.

Seeing Lu Mingxu staring blankly at her, speechless, Stella awkwardly chuckled and said, “I have to go now, I have things to do. Goodbye.”

Hoping not to see him again.

Stella wished this in her heart as she turned to walk out of the playground.

“Stella, this sounds like a psychological issue; can’t a psychologist help you?” Lu Mingxu called out after her, holding onto a glimmer of hope.

Stella paused and glanced back at Lu Mingxu, concocting a lie, “This is a congenital psychological issue; it can’t be treated, like anti-social personality disorder—there's no cure.”

Lu Mingxu was stunned into silence, feeling a wave of sadness wash over him, suddenly overwhelmed with the urge to cry.

If Stella was lying, then she truly must detest him to fabricate such a story!

But if this were true…

Once again, Lu Mingxu could only silently question the heavens—why did the woman he liked have to be love-incapable?

Deeply affected, Lu Mingxu could only watch helplessly as the person he admired walked further and further away.
