## Side Effects of the System

After returning to her dorm, Stella Ling popped a lollipop in her mouth and pulled out her phone to search for information about the Celestial Fortune System. 

Given that the Celestial Fortune System was a product far beyond the current technological level of Blue Star, Stella didn’t expect to find anything useful online. 

Sure enough, most of the results were just male-oriented web novels. The content mostly revolved around protagonists who, after obtaining the Celestial Fortune System, spent money to slap all the people who had previously looked down on them right in the face. They indulged in a spree of buying and buying, living a life surrounded by money and beautiful women, reveling in a whirlwind of parties every night. 

Some novel protagonists even made money with every breath they took. Others, upon binding the system, instantly received billions in mission funds. 

Stella felt that compared to these protagonists in novels, her own system was rather underwhelming. She had received a mere ten cents in task funds... 

With that thought in mind, Stella glanced at the little round ball of fluff resting beside her. Her Celestial Fortune System wasn’t like those described in novels; it didn’t just exist in her mind. It had a physical form. 

The system appeared as an adorable, chubby little kitten with black, white, and orange fur. Its tail was particularly short, resembling a fuzzy ball, and it had a pair of striking green cat eyes. Right now, it was staring intently at Stella's mouth, or more precisely, the lollipop she was holding. 

Stella rummaged through her bag and pulled out an extra lollipop, curiously asking, “Can you eat this?” 

“Absolutely!” The little kitten nodded furiously, its round head bobbing like it was mashing garlic. 

With the enthusiastic response, Stella cheerfully prepared to hand over the lollipop. She thought she’d need to unwrap it for the kitten, but to her surprise, it opened its mouth and swiftly grabbed the candy, skillfully using its tiny, claw-like paws to tear open the packaging. In a flash, the candy was in its mouth. 

“Wow, you’re amazing!” Stella marveled, realizing that real-life kittens couldn’t do that. 

“What’s so impressive about it? This system doesn’t even need to eat, but if you ever have something you don’t want to eat, just hand it over to me! I’ll take care of it!” The system patted its little chest with its paw, its eyes narrowing with delight as it savored the sweetness of the lollipop, its whiskers twitching with each lick. 

“I’m not picky.” 

Stella promptly rejected the system’s offer, leaving it quite dejected. It could only cherish the cheap milk-flavored lollipop even more, licking it anxiously as if it might disappear in a puddle of saliva at any moment. 

However, that tiny ten-cent lollipop—well, now it was worth fifteen cents—quickly vanished in the system’s mouth. 

After a brief moment of sulking, the little kitten perked up and declared, “This system has decided to give you more task funds tomorrow, so you can buy more lollipops!” 

With that, it winked at Stella, as if hinting that she should share a piece of candy with it after buying more. 

Stella couldn’t help but chuckle as she reached out to scratch its chin, and the system purred in delight, squinting its eyes like a real cat. 

Hearing that tomorrow’s task funds would increase made Stella happy, and she began to inquire about what functions the system had. 

She learned that the main function of the Celestial Fortune System was to provide funds for the host to spend. If the host failed a task, there would be no punishment, but the system would reclaim the task funds associated with the failed task. If successful, the reward would be the items purchased with the task funds. 

This rule was something Stella had already been informed of when she first encountered her daily task. 

Each day, the system would issue a daily task. After a week, a weekly task would be added on that day. After a month, a monthly task would be added. After a year, there would be an annual task. 

Additionally, there would be random tasks added at irregular intervals. 

Every time a weekly task, monthly task, annual task, or random task was completed, the host would not only receive the items they purchased with task funds but also an opportunity for a system lottery draw. 

The system lottery was a spinning wheel format, with rewards ranging from money and tangible goods to skills. 

Stella was particularly interested in the system lottery; the idea of effortlessly acquiring money was already fantastical enough, but gaining skills as well was even more surprising. However, the system mentioned that the prize pool for the lottery would change each time, and it couldn’t show her what was available right now. So, Stella had to temporarily suppress her curiosity. 

Notably, the system claimed to be a good system that respects the host's privacy. Although it was bound to the host’s soul and existed in her mind, it wouldn’t read her thoughts unless she willingly communicated with it internally. 

This reassurance made Stella feel a lot better; she didn’t want her innermost thoughts exposed to anyone else. 

Despite its appearance as a little kitten, the system was capable of understanding human language and communicating with people. 

“That’s the full extent of the Celestial Fortune System’s functions.” After tossing the empty plastic stick into the dorm’s trash can, the system stated. 

“That’s it?” Stella was incredulous. 

“That’s all.” The system shook its fluffy tail. 

“Free money? No punishment for failing tasks? This doesn’t follow the law of conservation of energy! Don’t I have to give something in return?” 

Furrowing her brow, Stella felt that things couldn’t be this simple. She had never believed in free lunches. 

Upon hearing this, the system fell silent for a moment, its green eyes darting around nervously, unwilling to meet Stella's gaze, as if it held some unspeakable secret. 

“Are you hiding something?” Stella keenly sensed the system’s unease and pressed on. 

The system nimbly jumped down from the desk and began pacing the room. After a while, it finally spoke truthfully, “Well... there are some side effects to binding the system.” 

A sense of foreboding arose in Stella’s heart as she pressed for details, “What side effects?” 

“Being pursued by Heaven’s Chosen Ones.” 

Stella blinked, taken aback. “Huh?” 

“Wait! Are you saying that the side effect of binding the system is being pursued by people, or by Heaven’s Chosen Ones?!” Stella asked uncertainly. 

“Yes.” The system nodded its little head. 

Stella was increasingly confused and asked the system in response, “Are you sure it’s pursuit and not chase?” 

“You’re being way too dramatic! If it were a chase, how could you enjoy spending money? It’s definitely pursuit!” The system exclaimed, its round eyes wide with surprise at Stella’s train of thought. 

“What kind of side effect is that?” 

Stella expressed her disbelief as she moved her desktop mirror to observe her appearance. 

With a round face, moderately double-lidded eyes, a nose that wasn’t too high or flat, and lips that were neither thin nor thick, her features were decidedly ordinary—a mere backdrop in a crowd, a shadow behind others. 

Now someone was telling her that she would be pursued by Heaven’s Chosen Ones? 

Was this a joke? 

As an orphan with an ordinary appearance and a salary that hadn’t even reached 5,000 yuan, how could she possibly attract any attention from men, let alone the so-called "Heaven’s Chosen Ones"? 

“Are you kidding me? Look at me! Which Heaven’s Chosen One would want to pursue someone like me?” 

Stella didn’t think less of herself; she simply kept a clear head in viewing the world. 

Her looks were unremarkable, her personality introverted and sensitive, and she had never been pursued by a man in her life. She was so solitary that she only had one friend. 

What kind of Heaven’s Chosen One could possibly fancy someone like her? 

Moreover, how could this system have such a bizarre side effect? 

Surely this little calico kitten wasn’t trying to trick her? 

Faced with the host's skepticism, the system stubbornly replied, “You’re not completely lacking in merit. Your skin is relatively fair; after all, a little fairness can mask three flaws.” 

Stella glanced down at her arms exposed by her short sleeves, feeling that her skin wasn’t all that fair. 

She attended a foreign language university in the capital that gathered students from all over the country, as well as international exchange students. 

Comparing herself to those exchange students from Europe and America was simply setting herself up for discomfort. 

Even within her own major, there were plenty of girls who were fairer than her. 

This made it hard for Stella to take the system's compliment seriously. 

Stella yawned lightly and decided to put the system’s claims about side effects aside for now. 

Deep down, she didn’t believe that a Heaven’s Chosen One would pursue her, an ordinary girl. 

Tomorrow, she had to go to work, so it was best to wash up and get some sleep.
