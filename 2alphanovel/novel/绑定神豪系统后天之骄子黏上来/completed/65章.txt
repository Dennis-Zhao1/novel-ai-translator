33 Billion

After resolving the rental issues for the Han National Hanyang Sports Gym, Stella Ling took Xu Shujun and others to various high-end cosmetics stores for a shopping spree. They shopped until noon, and it wasn't until the one-day usage of her American Express Black Card expired that Stella finally stopped her wild shopping spree.

Feeling drowsy, she led her bodyguards and Xu Shujun to Dr. Jin's cosmetic surgery hospital. Once there, she lay down on an empty hospital bed to catch up on some sleep.

Stella woke up due to hunger, blinking her eyes open to check her phone, realizing that only three hours had passed.

In the adjacent bed, Xu Shujun was lying down after undergoing double eyelid surgery and a nose augmentation, wearing headphones while scrolling through videos on her phone. Bandages were taped over her eyelids, and her nose was noticeably swollen.

"Does it hurt? Do you need some painkillers?" Stella asked with concern as she sat up in bed.

"I already took some, so it's not hurting too much now," Xu Shujun replied with a smile. However, as soon as she spoke, she felt a tightness in the muscles around her eyes and nose, and instinctively, she raised her hand to gently touch her nose.

"Don't touch it! You can't mess with your nose after surgery," Stella admonished, then continued, "Just lie down and rest. I'll check on the others."

With that, Stella left the shared hospital room.

Upon exiting the ward, a bodyguard from American Express, who had been standing at the door, resumed following Stella closely to ensure her safety. 

She checked on three more double rooms to confirm that the girl group members were in good condition before exiting the cosmetic hospital with her bodyguard.

Just as she was about to head out, she noticed that the Celestial Fortune System had released today's daily tasks. Stella planned to buy some tasty treats for her little kitty, as well as grab a bite herself to fill her stomach that had gone without food for more than a day. She also intended to pick up some fresh fruits and nuts for Xu Shujun and the others, as she had heard that these foods could aid in recovery after cosmetic surgery.

As for their dinner, the hospital would provide them with meals suitable for their current condition.

In a nearby supermarket, Stella bought an assortment of fruits, nuts, snacks, and energy drinks. Afterward, she stopped by a neighboring fried chicken joint to grab a bunch of fried chicken and snacks, ensuring there was enough food for the bodyguards as well. Right before the task deadline, she deposited the remaining 50,000 yuan of her task funds into the company’s basic account.

Chewing on spicy soup fish cakes, she chatted with the Celestial Fortune System in her mind, "I got some snacks for you, and as for the fried foods, I’ll order takeout for you when we get back to the hotel this afternoon, so just hang in there."

【Okay, but I want to eat a ton of fried chicken!】

"Deal!" Stella promised.

The surgeries that Xu Shujun and the others underwent weren't major, and after resting at the hospital for an afternoon and having dinner, they received a bunch of effective scar repair products before taking a ride back to Signiel Seoul Hotel around 9 PM.

Once back at the hotel room, Stella ordered a heap of fried chicken and snacks from Han National for the little kitty. After all the takeout arrived at the apartment, she shared a bit of food with Celestial Fortune before collapsing onto her bed to continue resting.

What Stella didn't know was that news about her quietly made its way onto the internet in both Han and Hua countries.

"Mysterious Hua Country Tycoon Goes on a Shopping Spree in Han, Spending 650 Billion Han Yuan in Two Days!"

This instantly sparked a frenzy of discussion among netizens from both countries.

In the Hua country's online community.

"How much is 650 billion Han Yuan in RMB? I remember Han's inflation, and their currency denominations seem quite large."

"That's about 3.3 billion RMB."

"How many zeros is that? Let me count. One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, ten million, uncle, grandpa, ancestor..."

"Upstairs, you only counted up to your uncle's generation, it's a total of 330 million RMB."

"MD, by the time it gets to my brother's generation, I feel like kneeling down!"

"That tycoon must be crazy! What could possibly be worth that much in Han? Spending all that money!"

"Could it be that they acquired an entertainment company in Han?"

"Don’t you read the article? That tycoon bought luxury goods!"

"Wow, buying luxury goods abroad for that much money, the rich second generation from the torn scallion family just got overshadowed!"

"Looking at the brands listed in the article, most are jewelry, clothing, bags, and cosmetics. This Hua tycoon can't be female, right?"

"How could that be? Hua country doesn't have any prominent female tycoons. It must be a male tycoon buying a dowry for his daughter!"

"Why daughter? Why not for his wife?"

"How could it possibly be for the wife? I’ve seen those tycoons, when they marry, they all sign prenuptial agreements to protect their assets. Men only spend this kind of money on their daughters!"

"Stop talking nonsense! My dad wouldn't even buy me a one-yuan ice cream, but he splurges on cosmetics and mink fur for my mom!"

"Have you considered that you might be adopted?"

"Regardless of whether this person is a tycoon or not, I just want to say, he's spending money like a local! So tacky! He could have saved that money for investments!"

"I also want to be that tacky..."

"A big shot who spends 3.3 billion on luxury goods must have countless investment projects already. He's just spending a little to indulge himself."

"Little money..."

"Spending over a hundred million isn't tacky, it's grand!"

"After my assessment, this is fake news released by Han. Everyone knows Hua country has many wealthy people, and Han spending money on such hot searches is just to stimulate us to travel and spend in their country."

"Damn! Now that you mention it, I also feel something's off! If you're going to buy, you should do it in Western countries, buying luxury goods in Han seems strange!"

Sitting in his office, Liu Dengfeng looked at the trending news on his phone and chuckled.

Of course, it was fake.

These Han people are really something, making up such ridiculous stories.

At that moment, Liu Dengfeng's phone suddenly rang.

It was his old friend, Peng Lide.

Liu Dengfeng answered the call, saying with a smile, "Hey, Old Peng, what’s up?"

"Old Liu, Miss Ling bought over 300 million worth of cars in Han, and they're all being sent to our shop for maintenance! I wanted to ask you what kind of license plate number Miss Ling is interested in, so I can prepare it for her."

"What? 300 million!"

Liu Dengfeng jumped up from his chair, shouting.

Then, as if remembering something, he followed up with, "Is Miss Ling in Han right now?"

"Yes, didn’t you know?"

Peng Lide said.

How could Liu Dengfeng know? Miss Ling hadn’t mentioned this at all.

For some reason, Liu Dengfeng suddenly recalled the trending news he had just seen.

Holding his phone, he said, "I have something to take care of right now; we can talk about the license plate later!"

"Hey, hey, hey! Don’t hang up! What’s the matter? Is it related to Miss Ling?" Peng Lide asked curiously.

"I'll tell you when I get back!"

With that, Liu Dengfeng hung up the phone, took the elevator downstairs, and headed toward the International Financial Building.

When he arrived at the apartment where Stella worked, he found the door slightly ajar, and all the employees of Xingchen Entertainment were busy unboxing deliveries.

"This set is for Xu Shujun; it will be sent to her room later."

"This one is for Park Hanen, and this set is also for her."

As Li Xiang directed the employees in unboxing, he spoke.

"How much has Miss Ling bought? They’ve been unpacking all morning..."

Tian Rui, who had just joined Xingchen Entertainment as a dance instructor at the beginning of the month, sighed while sorting through countless clothes.

"Miss Ling said these are all outfits for the company’s artists. There’s still more. Teacher Tian, please bear with it for the next couple of days; Miss Ling will pay you overtime," Li Xiang said apologetically.

If it weren’t for Miss Ling’s requirement that anyone applying to the company must pass her interview, Li Xiang would have posted job listings online long ago, and they wouldn’t be short-staffed now.

With the current shortage of staff, they could only ask Teacher Tian and two drivers to help out.

"Uh, do you need my help?" Liu Dengfeng suddenly interjected, startling the employees who were busy unpacking.

"Manager Liu, what brings you here?" Zhou Yulan asked, putting down the scissors she was using to unbox.

"I need to speak with Miss Ling about something," Liu Dengfeng replied.

"Miss Ling is on a business trip in Han and won’t be back for a few days. If it’s urgent, you can call her directly, Manager Liu," Li Xiang stood up and answered.

"It’s not urgent; we can discuss it when Miss Ling returns."

Liu Dengfeng smiled and rubbed his hands, glancing at the pile of luxury goods scattered around. He became more convinced that the tycoon who spent 3.3 billion RMB in Han was indeed Miss Ling.

However, he thought the amount in the news was a bit exaggerated.

Miss Ling probably spent around 400 million, especially since the cars being sent to Old Peng’s shop were worth 300 million. The clothing, shoes, and bags piled on the floor, even considering the brands, shouldn’t exceed 100 million.

Originally, Liu Dengfeng wanted to ask if they needed assistance again but noticed Li Xiang had a rather apologetic expression and said, "Manager Liu, we have a ton of packages here, so it’s not convenient to entertain you."

"Oh, alright then, you all carry on. I’ll come back when Miss Ling is back in the country."

Liu Dengfeng sensed Li Xiang’s intentions to politely send him off and gave a dry laugh in response.

Afterward, Liu Dengfeng turned and left the apartment.

With luxury brands all over the place, he wasn’t an employee of Xingchen Entertainment, so Director Li naturally wouldn’t ask him to help.

In fact, they were also wary of him.

Liu Dengfeng wasn’t annoyed at all; if Li Xiang had readily agreed to let him help and called in other employees to assist, he might have second thoughts and later report Miss Ling for not managing her administrative director properly.

That said, if Miss Ling really spent 3.3 billion in Han, Liu Dengfeng seriously considered resigning from Longhua Property Center to join Xingchen Entertainment.

However, that was obviously impossible.

Besides the 300 million luxury cars, what else could possibly account for the remaining 3 billion?

Liu Dengfeng suddenly remembered that the trending news article mentioned the tycoon had visited several jewelry brand stores.

Impossible!

Absolutely impossible!

No matter how wealthy someone is, they shouldn’t go about buying jewelry like that!

They could host a jewelry exhibition!

After spending a week in Han, finishing all her cosmetic procedures, Stella Ling finally returned to Hua Country, Rongcheng, with Xu Shujun and the others.

By this time, Stella had a slight redness on her face from the water-light needle treatment.

If you were to ask her how she felt after the water-light needle treatment in Han, her answer would be regret!

Had she known it would hurt this much, she would never have gone through with it!

Indeed, becoming beautiful comes at a price!

After the water-light needle treatment, Stella had another thought.

That was her growing resentment towards the islanders who were living well!

She had to endure heavy anesthesia just to get a water-light needle, yet the experience felt like torture, leaving her trembling and drenched in cold sweat, struggling to speak clearly!

Her ancestors from Hua must have suffered even worse at the hands of those island devils!

In that moment, Stella felt an intense hatred towards the island devils!

On July 13th, the renovations of Xingchen Entertainment on the top floor of the International Financial Building were finally completed.

Because they used only the best materials, the wallpaper in the company was even edible once peeled off. Therefore, a week after the renovation, on July 19th, Stella and all of her employees moved into their new office.

Even though they used the finest materials, to ensure the absolute safety of herself and her employees, Stella implemented a series of protective measures to make sure they wouldn’t be affected by any harmful gases.

Sitting in her spacious office, Stella popped a slice of orange into her mouth while Celestial Fortune squatted on the desk, munching on an orange slice too.

To allow her little kitty to breathe freely in the fresh air, Stella had already announced its new identity to the company’s artists and employees.

Now, anyone from Xingchen Entertainment, along with Manager Liu, knew that this plump calico cat was Miss Ling’s pet and could roam freely in the office.

Stroking Celestial Fortune's round little head, Stella instructed, "Celestial Fortune, some people will be coming in for interviews shortly, so you need to act like a normal cat later."

【Don’t worry, I won’t mess up!】

Celestial Fortune had now mastered the softer tones of speech, though it still dragged out the endings a bit.

Today, Stella was interviewing employees from various departments and assistants for the artists.

...

Zhang Qian sat in the interview waiting area, observing the environment of the company before her.

It was big, but there weren’t many employees.

Moreover, she hadn’t heard of this company before, leading her to believe it was a new entertainment company.

Initially, Zhang Qian didn’t think much of this interview as a remarkable opportunity, but after witnessing the administrative assistant’s courteous treatment of the interviewees, she felt the competitive atmosphere in the waiting area thickening, and she began to feel a bit nervous.

They offered free snacks, fruits, coffee, juice, and tea, and the administrative assistants were quick to serve everything to the interviewees.

This was the first time Zhang Qian had encountered such a generous company for interviewees.

She wasn’t sure whether to mock the company for being foolish with their money or to admire the employees working there. 

It inevitably reminded her of her own experiences as an artist's assistant.
