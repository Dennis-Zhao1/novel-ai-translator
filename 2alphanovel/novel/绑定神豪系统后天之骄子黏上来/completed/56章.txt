**I Will Not Back Down**

Stella Ling had spent a grueling eight hours immersed in the performances of girl groups from parallel universes, feeling both exhausted and exhilarated. These eight hours were filled with spectacular stage works from popular girl groups across various countries.

After watching those performances, Stella was inspired with the idea of creating a concept girl group.

So, what exactly is a concept girl group? 

Typically, it refers to an idol group whose style changes with each new album. Stella envisioned one that could embody a range of styles—from the ethereal forest girl aesthetic, to magical, fairy-like vibes, to cheerleader themes, and even extending to cartoon pixel art and psychedelic, surreal trends. 

But that's not all; the concept of such a group means there’s no fixed image, allowing for an array of different themes and concepts.

The culture of Huaguo (China) is based on the ancient civilization of Huaxia, fully integrating cultural elements from various regions and ethnic groups throughout the country. It is a culture formed from the fusion of diverse and heterogeneous cultures, characterized by uniqueness, subjectivity, continuity, diversity, and flexibility. In summary, it is an inclusive culture that embraces and integrates the cultural aspects of various ethnicities.

Stella dreamt of taking her girl group international, which meant producing entertainment works that resonate with different cultures worldwide. Domestically, she aimed to create outstanding works that embody the spirit of patriotism and national pride. Internationally, she planned to continuously release remarkable foreign works that had become hits in parallel universes.

With her keen insight and the capabilities of her laptop, which connected to these parallel universes, Stella was confident she could forge a C-POP concept girl group with strong cultural inclusivity!

The next morning, as soon as Stella woke up, she grabbed her laptop and began sifting through resumes in the company email. Over the past couple of days, she had encountered an array of bizarre submissions while filtering through the artist applications. 

Among the resumes, only a small fraction adhered to the advertising requirements. Most applicants either submitted flashy template resumes with vague content, mismatched qualifications, or photos overly edited with filters, with some even covering their faces in a bid to look cool. Shockingly, some parents had even sent in pictures of their kindergarten-age children, inquiring about opportunities to enter the entertainment industry as child stars. 

The most shocking were the explicit photos! But those were not even the worst. The truly despicable were the ones who sent gruesome, bloody images! Each time Stella encountered such horror-movie-like screenshots or gory, low-budget film stills, she felt like cursing out loud. They scared her to death!

Since the recruitment advertisement for Star Entertainment was scheduled to end on the 30th of this month, the application period also concluded on that day. During this time, she and her colleagues, Li Xiang and Chen Duo, managed to sift through a total of 893 qualified resumes.

During this period, Stella completed four daily tasks and one weekly task. The funds from the four daily tasks were used to provide her three employees, two drivers, and two artists with long-lasting Ai Guo phones, and she paid for a year’s worth of phone service to facilitate internal communication amongst the staff.

The 25 million yuan from the weekly task was then deposited into Star Entertainment's main account. Following this week’s task, Stella won a skill upgrade from the system that increased her daily task funding amount. Therefore, on the 30th, the daily task funding she received would jump from 10,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, with the task time still set at 30 minutes. This increased funding would continue until she drew another skill upgrade.

Stella decided to utilize the daily task funding on the 30th to rent an interview venue. She rented a 300-square-meter space on the 49th floor of the International Financial Building for interviews with artists and employees. The rent was 25,000 yuan a month, with a deposit of one month’s rent paid upfront, totaling four months.

On July 1st, from morning until night, Stella was busy calling the candidates who had passed the resume screening to notify them to come for interviews from July 2nd to 8th between 9:00 and 9:30 AM. If they missed that window, they could reschedule for another day. 

Due to the sheer number of people to notify, Stella even roped in Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng to help with the interview notifications. Out of the 893 qualified resumes, 32 phone calls went unanswered, and 18 individuals could not attend the interviews. Ultimately, Stella successfully contacted 843 candidates.

After making the last notification call, Stella was shocked to realize it was already 7 PM.

【Publish today's daily task: Spend 100,000 yuan in 30 minutes!】

The task echoed in Stella's mind. To thank her artists and staff for their hard work, she decided to treat them to a meal. They didn’t even need to go out; the fourth floor of the International Financial Building housed a well-reviewed Cantonese restaurant—Guohai Restaurant.

Upon arriving at Guohai Restaurant, Stella quickly signed up for a membership card and loaded it with 100,000 yuan, effectively completing her daily task. 

With eight people dining, and knowing that while Cantonese dishes are exquisite and delicious, they are generally served in smaller portions, Stella ordered most of the dishes in double servings, just to be safe. She ordered four portions of maple syrup roasted pork, four portions of Eight Immortals dim sum platter, four portions of steamed chicken feet with soy sauce, four portions of crispy chicken with pomelo, four portions of jade dragon dumplings, four portions of beef rice rolls with dried tangerine peel, double servings of scallop shrimp balls, double servings of stir-fried crab in the style of Typhoon Shelter, double servings of pork ribs with black bean sauce, double servings of stir-fried beef rice noodles, double servings of stir-fried Chinese broccoli, double servings of durian pastry, one portion of seasonal vegetables, one crispy roast suckling pig, and one roasted goose.

For dessert, she ordered four portions of mango sago pudding, two portions of red bean soup with tangerine peel, and two portions of lotus seeds with peach gum. The total came to 6,640 yuan.

Next, Stella placed an order for 3,360 yuan worth of takeout, planning to pack the leftovers to take home. In total, she spent exactly 10,000 yuan on this meal.

Li Xiang, the company's HR director, was taken aback upon hearing the total. After witnessing Stella’s extravagant spending on office supplies just a few days earlier, this meal once again reshaped her understanding of Stella’s spending habits. 

However, the finance director, Zhou Yulan, remained unfazed. During her accounting sessions, she had noticed how Stella would deposit large sums into the company’s main account, which had ballooned from the original 10 million to nearly 100 million. Given that Stella had just ordered a 100,000 yuan meal, Zhou Yulan felt no surprise.

The group enjoyed their meal, thoroughly satisfied, with plenty of leftovers that were divided among the five employees to take home. Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng also wanted to take some, but Stella, citing the importance of image management for artists, barred them from snacking on the leftovers.

Xu Shujun: "…"

Song Mengmeng: (╥_╥)

On July 2nd, at 9 AM, a group of young and vibrant girls, all around the age of 20, arrived punctually at the interview venue on the 49th floor of the International Financial Building. 

Xu Shujun and Song Mengmeng were responsible for guiding these girls into the interview space, arranging their seats, and collecting their resumes. 

Administrative assistant Chen Duo was in charge of calling candidates into the small office for their interviews. 

Li Xiang and Zhou Yulan sat in the small office, acting as interviewers. 

Zhou Yulan felt nervous in her role as an interviewer. While Li Xiang had experience in administrative HR, Zhou Yulan couldn’t quite understand why Stella would have her, a finance person, serve as an interviewer too.

“Don’t be nervous. Didn’t Stella just say we only need to keep the candidates with marked resumes?” Li Xiang reassured her, noticing Zhou Yulan’s unease.

“What should I say during the interview?” Zhou Yulan asked, looking to Li Xiang for guidance.

“Have the interviewees introduce themselves, then ask them to perform a talent showcase, and then call in the next one,” Li Xiang suggested, adding that she had never worked in an entertainment company either, but this seemed like a standard procedure for auditioning artists.

Though she couldn’t gauge the quality of the performances, they had Stella overseeing the process, so any artists she chose to keep would surely be promising!

At 9:05 AM, dressed in a stylish professional outfit, Stella entered the interview venue and activated her Insightful Gaze ability. 

She approached Xu Shujun, took the neatly organized resumes from her hands, and pulled out a red marker from her bag. Her calm gaze swept over the heads of the girls waiting for their interviews. 

5.7, 7.3, 6.3… 4.5. 

Out of the 63 girls who participated in the interviews, none had a potential score exceeding 8. Stella felt a pang of anxiety. 

It’s fine; there would be more candidates to come; surely she could find some promising ones!

Stella carried the stack of resumes into the small office, handed them to Li Xiang and Zhou Yulan, and instructed them to begin the interviews. 

Time ticked away. 

By 9:30 AM, an additional 78 candidates arrived for their interviews. Among them, two girls had potential scores exceeding 9. 

One scored 9.1, while the other scored 9.4. 

Stella ultimately decided to keep the girl with the 9.4 score. The other 9.1 girl failed the character assessment. 

Her character was rated as average, indicating that she was self-serving and neglectful of others' interests. 

Such individuals were unsuitable for the girl group, which thrived on teamwork and cooperation. 

Furthermore, Stella had no intention of recruiting someone with average character into the company. She believed that investing resources into such an individual would likely lead to early contract termination or a refusal to renew, as they might seek to start their own artist studio.

From the perspective of an entertainment company owner, Stella was not interested in hiring individuals with average character traits. She desired to recruit artists with excellent or exceptional character. 

Actually, it was better to avoid hiring those with exceptional character traits too; they might sacrifice their own interests to prioritize others, which would be foolish. It was best to find individuals with excellent character traits, like Shujun and Mengmeng, who were both decent individuals that balanced their interests with the needs of others.

Stella glanced at the girl with a potential score of 9.4 and an excellent character rating who exuded a graceful aura. 

She flipped through the stack of resumes until she located the one belonging to Park Han-eun. This girl, like Song Mengmeng, was a member of an ethnic minority; she was of Korean descent.

Stella's interest was piqued. She closely examined Han-eun's resume and discovered that she had five years of trainee experience at GY Company in Han Country. 

In this world, GY was likely comparable to YG in the parallel universe, right? 

How impressive! 

YG is one of the largest entertainment companies in Han Country! 

No wonder Park Han-eun had a score of 9.4 for her singing and dancing skills. 

Stella felt a rush of excitement. After stepping into the small office, she marked a circle around Park Han-eun's resume with her red marker and returned it to its place, handing it to Li Xiang.

Both Li Xiang and Zhou Yulan appeared thrilled upon seeing this. 

Stella had finally found an artist she liked!

Since Park Han-eun arrived a bit late, her interview was scheduled for 3 PM. Stella decided to personally conduct the interview.

Facing the three interviewers, Park Han-eun was unfazed. She confidently introduced herself, “Hello, interviewers! My name is Park Han-eun, I’m of Korean descent, 20 years old, and I have five years of trainee experience at GY Company. My specialties are dancing and singing.”

Stella, sitting in her chair, locked her gaze on Park Han-eun and asked, “You trained for five years at GY; why didn’t you debut there? Was it because your skills didn’t meet the debut standards in Han Country?” 

Park Han-eun was not intimidated by Stella’s pointed question. She shook her head and explained, “I believe my skills are up to the debut standard. GY even offered me a debut opportunity, which I declined. After my trainee contract expired, I returned home directly.”

“Why?” 

Stella was puzzled. She did not sense any deceit in Park Han-eun’s words; a 9.4 potential score wasn’t something to joke about. 

Since acquiring the Insightful Gaze ability, Stella had only discovered six trainees in Jing City with potential scores above 9. It was truly rare!

Most artists who went to Han Country to work typically debuted there, gaining fame and building their popularity before returning home in glory. 

So why did Park Han-eun choose a different path? 

“Han Country is quite exclusionary, especially at GY. No matter how capable I am, I would never get the center position in a group. I will not back down!” 

Park Han-eun’s tone was firm.

In truth, that wasn’t the only reason. Park Han-eun also disliked dancing in front of the high-ranking chaebols of Han Country. 

Every time she encountered their leering gazes, it made her want to vomit. 

The thought of potentially facing worse situations after debuting was enough to make her want to leave Han Country altogether. 

Her fellow trainees had warned her that even upon returning to Huaguo, the entertainment industry could be just as dark, urging her to accept reality. 

But Park Han-eun couldn’t reconcile with that notion and refused to believe that her country’s entertainment industry would be as corrupt as Han Country’s. 

So, with a gamble in mind, she returned home. 

Not long after her arrival, she stumbled upon Star Entertainment’s recruitment advertisement on the cryptocurrency platform she frequented and submitted her resume, hoping for a chance.
