Stella Ling had a fantastic night's sleep last night.

At 5 AM, the first thing she did upon waking was check her bank account balance through her mobile banking app.

She glanced at it repeatedly, confirming that she had indeed become a multi-millionaire, and couldn't help but break into a silly grin.

It seemed like it was time to start house-hunting.

The thought of soon becoming a homeowner made Stella giddy as she tossed and turned in bed, rousing the little system cat that slept beside her.

“Hmm… Are you ready to take on a task?” the system asked, rubbing its eyes with tiny paws.

Stella quickly waved her hands, “No, no, no! You can send me tasks later. Why don’t you sleep a little more?”

Once she had coaxed the little cat back to sleep, Stella sighed in relief and quietly got out of bed.

Today, she decided against buying breakfast at the little supermarket's breakfast shop and instead ordered some takeout.

Two large bowls of stir-fried liver, two cups of freshly ground soy milk, and two pork and green onion buns.

Just ordering these cost her 76 yuan, and with the delivery fee, it totaled 80 yuan.

In the past, Stella would never have splurged on breakfast like this, but now that money was no longer an issue, ordering like this felt perfectly normal.

Besides, she had been craving stir-fried liver ever since she woke up. It had been a while since she last had it—over a year, in fact. If she wanted it today, then why not indulge?

When Stella returned to her dorm with the food, the system immediately opened its eyes at the delicious aroma and hopped off the bed excitedly. “What did you get? It smells amazing!”

“I got stir-fried liver and buns, plus soy milk! Come eat!” Stella laughed, inviting the little system.

There were six pork and green onion buns in total, but Stella only took one for herself and left the rest for the system.

The rich, garlicky aroma of the stir-fried liver wafted through the air, mixed with its glossy sauce, instantly making her mouth water. Without hesitation, she scooped a spoonful and tasted it.

“Yum, so good~” Stella exclaimed, savoring the flavor.

The liver and sausage were rich but not greasy, and the consistency was just right—neither too runny nor too thick.

With each bite, the flavors of garlic and pepper danced on her palate, while she occasionally chewed on pieces of liver, sausage, and lung.

The offal in the stir-fried liver had no odd taste at all; the texture was incredibly tender.

Eating a bowl of it for breakfast made Stella feel rejuvenated.

After finishing one bowl of stir-fried liver, she felt pleasantly full but decided to eat a bun to round off her meal just right.

Stir-fried liver was quite pricey; a small bowl about the size of an adult fist cost over ten yuan. Although she had ordered a larger bowl for 25 yuan, it didn’t seem like there was much more food than in the smaller bowl.

Perhaps it was just that she loved it so much that she felt it wasn’t enough.

While many outsiders might consider stir-fried liver to be an acquired taste, it was just perfect for someone like Stella, a Northerner.

She had even heard classmates mention that it was similar to the spicy soup called Hu La Tang, so she thought she might try that someday too.

Stella didn’t arrive at work an hour early today. When she got to the office, she noticed several colleagues gathered around Yang Lan’s desk, buzzing with excitement over some discussion.

Just as she was setting her bag down, Yang Lan called her over, waving her hand.

Curious, Stella leaned in closer to find out what they were discussing.

“Stella, did you watch Douyin yesterday?” Yang Lan asked enthusiastically.

“Uh, I did. Why?” Stella replied, her curiosity piqued.

Not only had she watched, but she had also sent over four million yuan in tips during a live stream.

“Ah, then you must have seen it—the best gift for Children’s Day?” Yang Lan continued.

“Hmm?” Stella was confused.

Seeing that Stella didn’t seem to understand, Yang Lan quickly urged her to check the trending topics on Douyin, and then resumed her chatter with the others about the hot event.

Stella pulled up Douyin and saw that the top trending topic was indeed titled “The Best Gift for Children’s Day.”

Clicking on the title, the realization hit her—this trending topic was about her!

Her tipping of “Mama Anning” and “Immunodeficiency Yangyang” had become the number one trending topic on Douyin!

“Hey, do you think the brightest star in the night sky will reveal themselves in the future?” one colleague speculated.

“Of course! It’s likely there’s a team operating behind the scenes! Otherwise, why would they donate through tips? Isn’t that a bit silly? It’s all about getting the heat up through high donations! They want to get famous!” another chimed in.

“They should hurry up and reveal themselves; otherwise, once the heat dies down, it’ll be hard for them to cash in on this fame again,” someone else added.

“Or maybe they genuinely want to help others?” another colleague countered.

Hearing that made Stella blush a little; her initial intention when tipping was not that noble.

If she hadn’t won a tenfold cash-back card for live stream tips in a lucky draw, she might not have even downloaded Douyin.

Even if she had downloaded it, she certainly wouldn’t have sought out live streams of hosts like “Mama Anning.”

So her desire to genuinely help others was really just the system’s way of encouraging her to do good deeds.

Sure enough, laughter erupted around her as her colleagues teased, “No way!”

“If there really were such a saintly figure, they wouldn’t be in a live stream; they’d be at a charity’s donation box, where they could donate even more money. Donating through tips is just for gaining fame and money, isn’t it?” Yang Lan chuckled and shook her head.

Stella felt a bit down; donating through tips did seem a bit foolish.

Even if she had benefited from it, to outsiders, it looked either foolish or self-serving.

“Maybe the brightest star in the night sky couldn’t stand the current state of live streaming and deliberately boosted this kind of video’s popularity to bring people like Mama Anning into the limelight, urging everyone to pay attention to those in need of help. You’ve all seen the aftermath, right? A lot of new viewers have jumped in to help out because they admired her good deed. I even donated 100 yuan myself yesterday.”

One colleague who had defended the brightest star earlier chimed in again.

Stella glanced at this new colleague, Jin Linghua, who had just joined the company a couple of days ago. She really wanted to tell her that her thoughts weren’t as noble as she believed.

She hadn’t imagined that those viewers would follow suit and donate.

“... That situation you’re describing is possible,” Yang Lan said, stifling a grin as she looked at Jin Linghua’s serious expression.

Jin Linghua was just a fresh graduate stepping into society, full of dreams and aspirations, so it was better not to dampen her spirits.

Seeing someone agree with her, Jin Linghua couldn’t help but smile back at Yang Lan, her innocent expression causing the nearby colleagues to suppress their laughter, not wanting to offend her.

They returned to their workstations, stifling their chuckles.

Stella, however, was not among them. She approached Jin Linghua to exchange WeChat contacts.

This was the first time Stella had taken the initiative to add someone on WeChat, and Jin Linghua readily agreed, even leaning in closer to whisper.

“I could tell long ago that Yang Jie and the others didn’t agree with my opinions and thought I was naive, but I guess your thoughts align with mine, right?” Jin Linghua asked Stella softly.

Looking at the eager expression on the girl’s face, Stella smiled and nodded, making Jin Linghua beam with joy.

After a brief chat, they returned to their respective workstations.

Just as Stella sat down, she felt a wave of low pressure in the air.

Turning to look, she saw Wang Lingling furiously typing on her phone, muttering, “Bitch! He doesn’t even like you! You dare to drag this onto the internet? Bitch! Bitch!”

Stella felt goosebumps rise on her skin; what was Wang Lingling going on about this time?

She wanted to shift her chair further away, but Wang Lingling suddenly grabbed her arm, exclaiming, “Quick, open Douyin and help me scold her!”

“Scold who?” Stella asked, utterly baffled.

“Scold Meng Yan Ban Xia!” Wang Lingling gritted her teeth in reply.

“I’m not doing that!” Stella immediately refused.

What was she, crazy? Why would she help Wang Lingling insult someone else?

“You have to!” 

Wang Lingling shoved her phone right in front of Stella’s face, her resentment boiling over, “Do you know what that bitch did?”

What could it be? Offended you, perhaps!

Stella felt a bit impatient but still glanced at Wang Lingling's phone.

On the screen was a video of a beautiful girl crying profusely as she recounted how she had tried to add a man on WeChat last Thursday, only to be rudely rejected.

The scene then shifted to a surveillance video in a shopping mall, clearly showing Meng Yan Ban Xia approaching a tall, handsome young man.

The video quality was poor, but Stella could vaguely make out that the man was quite good-looking.

It was unclear what they had said, but the man walked away; however, Meng Yan Ban Xia continued to follow him, and they exchanged words before the man left on his own.

The entire video was silent.

The screen then switched back to Meng Yan Ban Xia, with the surveillance footage showing in a small window to the side.

Through her tears, Meng Yan Ban Xia explained, “I thought he was very handsome. Everyone knows I like making friends with good-looking guys and pretty girls, so I went up to him and asked to add him on WeChat. I thought I was quite polite…”

As she continued, Meng Yan Ban Xia broke down again, seemingly reliving her painful memories.

“If he didn’t want to add me, he could have just politely refused. But that man said, ‘I don’t want to add a ugly girl’s WeChat.’”

“I was stunned! It was the first time in my life someone called me ugly! How rude of him! I just wanted to reason with him.”

“Who would have thought he looked at me with such disdain, as if I were trash, and then walked away?”

“I naturally followed him to continue arguing, wanting him to take back his rude words and apologize!”

“Never did I expect him to become even more outrageous! If it weren’t for the staff at the nearby store noticing the situation, I would have thought he might even hit me!”

As the video ended, Meng Yan Ban Xia covered her face and sobbed uncontrollably.

“So why should I scold her?” 

After watching the video, Stella was completely confused. Wasn’t this just a girl being rudely rejected by a man when asking for his WeChat? 

Why was she being asked to insult Meng Yan Ban Xia instead of that man?

Wang Lingling was fuming, pausing the video on the surveillance footage and pointing at the man, asking, “Can’t you see who this is?”

Stella leaned closer to study the phone closely.

The man looked somewhat familiar, but the video was too blurry for her to match it with any clear face from her memory.

Besides the man, Stella also felt like Meng Yan Ban Xia looked a bit familiar, and even the place in the surveillance video seemed familiar.

Seeing that Stella couldn’t figure it out, Wang Lingling was exasperated. “This is Li Qicheng! The president of Jinghua International Trade Center, which is about to collaborate with our company!”

Stella blinked, realizing that this was indeed Li Qicheng!

No wonder he looked so familiar!

Now that she looked again at the handsome man in the video, she suddenly recalled the good-looking man with a kingly demeanor.

Plus, the man she had briefly felt attracted to was actually the president of Jinghua International Trade!

What a coincidence!

Remembering her experience at KFC last week, Stella felt that Meng Yan Ban Xia was lying.

When Li Qicheng had added her on WeChat, he had been polite and acted like a gentleman; there was no way he could be the kind of person Meng Yan Ban Xia was describing!

“Now you know who he is, right? Hurry up and help me scold this bitch!” 

Wang Lingling said, a mixture of pride and indignation written all over her face, creating a strange and twisted expression.

“Oh, okay, okay,” Stella hurriedly replied.

She verbally agreed, but in her heart, she didn’t relent. Why should she blindly follow Wang Lingling’s commands?

She wasn’t her mother!

Though Stella believed Meng Yan Ban Xia was lying, she didn’t intend to insult her in the way Wang Lingling suggested.

Even if Meng Yan Ban Xia spoke untruths, she didn’t think it was right to drag people onto the internet like this.

The nature of the incident wasn’t particularly malicious.

If someone got rejected and felt insulted enough to want to make it public, dragging it online, wouldn’t that just lead to a deluge of similar videos?

Conversely, if Meng Yan Ban Xia was wronging Li Qicheng, the nature of that incident would become far more serious.

Putting someone on blast online infringes on their rights to their image.

If she unjustly smeared someone, depending on the severity, it could even lead to charges of defamation.
