**Laptop Connecting Parallel Universes**

"Stella, I don’t know when your birthday is…"

The sad, childlike voice of the Celestial Fortune System echoed in Stella Ling's mind.

"I never told you, plus I forgot myself! Besides, you send me money every day. It feels like I'm celebrating my birthday every day~"

Stella thought to herself, a smile creeping onto her face.

"Eh heh~ Can we have a cream cake today? I suddenly want some~" 

Well, it seems the mention of birthdays made you think about cake, huh? Just like a little greedy kitten.

"Alright, alright. After I finish this farewell dinner, I’ll get you one," Stella replied, chuckling. Then she added, "By the way, besides detecting the nearby men identified as Heaven's Chosen Ones, make sure to alert me if they appear around me."

"Ah? You want me to remind you of that too? That guy with the surname Zhong was just nearby!" the system alerted her.

"What!?" Stella exclaimed, her expression shifting to one of caution as she swiftly looked around.

"He’s already left. He departed right after you finished talking with Lu Mingxu," the system clarified.

Hearing this, Stella relaxed. In her mind, the man with the surname Zhong was undoubtedly the most extreme among the known Heaven's Chosen Ones. She couldn't help but wonder how he reacted after she rejected that set of jewelry last time. But honestly, she didn't want to know.

What she really wanted to find out was whether he had overheard her conversation with Lu Mingxu. Honestly, she hoped he had. That way, if he approached her again, she wouldn’t have to repeat that she was incapable of love.

Zhong Shensheng indeed heard them. Even though he was some distance away from Stella and Lu Mingxu, he could easily eavesdrop on their conversation using advanced technology.

"Unable to love, huh?" Zhong Shensheng, seated in his wheelchair, lightly bit his thin lips, his elongated phoenix eyes swirling with complex emotions.

At that moment, a man in black who was pushing Zhong's wheelchair leaned down and suggested, "Mr. Zhong, should I invite Miss Ling to the Zhong residence?"

Upon hearing this, Zhong Shensheng's eyes darkened, and a mocking smile appeared. "Do you think my affairs require your meddling?"

"You're only here to assist me, not to manage my life," he added coldly.

The man in black immediately straightened up, lowering his head in apology. "I’m sorry, Mr. Zhong. I overstepped."

Zhong Shensheng ignored him, maneuvering his wheelchair forward without a care. 

"Unable to love, huh?" 

Zhong Shensheng found this amusing. He wished for Stella Ling to never belong to any man throughout her life. Just to let him quietly observe her from the shadows until his life burned out.

After finishing her graduation farewell dinner, Stella Ling waved goodbye to Yang Dan and Liu Lu. She stepped out of Qinghua Garden, holding two champagne roses, intending to take a taxi to the airport. After encountering two Heaven’s Chosen Ones in a single day, she had no desire to remain in Beijing any longer.

As she contemplated, a vibrant shade of rose red caught her eye.

"Stella, congratulations on your graduation!" 

Li Qizhen presented a bouquet of red roses to her, smiling warmly.

Stella Ling: "..."

Great, all three of the Heaven's Chosen Ones she knew had shown up today.

She scoffed coldly, countering, "What? You don’t wish me a happy birthday?"

Li Qizhen bit his beautifully shaped lips, unsure how to respond. 

This reaction confirmed to him that Stella must have known about his investigation into her.

"Stella, I think there’s been a misunderstanding between us," he said, his gaze softening as he looked at her.

"Misunderstanding? Are we talking about you stalking me or checking my bank account?" Stella shot back, meeting his light-colored eyes with unwavering intensity, exposing the truths he wanted to conceal.

Stella never understood why Li Qizhen needed to check her bank account. Even if it were to investigate a business competitor, there should be a legitimate reason. Yet this man was abusing his power and money, checking whoever he pleased!

What was he checking for? Afraid that she might out-earn him?

"I'm sorry, I know I was wrong. I just really like you..." 

"Stop right there!" Stella interrupted, raising her hand to cut off his words. She had no interest in hearing his excuses. 

She was certain that if she hadn’t exposed Li Qizhen's facade, he would have continued pretending everything was fine, maintaining his noble and elegant image in front of her. 

Unlike her patience with Lu Mingxu earlier, she couldn’t tolerate the sight of Li Qizhen crumbling before her. Perhaps it was because she had felt a slight attraction to him during their first meeting.

"I’m telling you clearly today, I don’t like you and won’t develop feelings for anyone because I am incapable of love!"

"If you don’t know what 'unable to love' means, just check online!" 

With that, Stella walked away without caring about Li Qizhen’s reaction, heading toward a nearby taxi.

Li Qizhen desperately wanted to stop her, to prevent her from leaving. But Stella had clearly displayed her unwillingness to engage, making him hesitate to act. He feared that if he tried to hold onto her, it would only make her angrier.

Watching the person he cared about drive away, he felt a mix of sadness and helplessness as she distanced herself from him. 

Had he really messed everything up?

For the first time, the man who thought he could control everything began doubting himself.

"She’s telling the truth!" 

A woman’s voice suddenly broke through Li Qizhen's thoughts.

Turning, he saw a stranger in a purple dress.

"She truly is incapable of love; I saw her use that excuse to turn someone down earlier today. She has a psychological condition!" 

Wang Lingling continued, hoping Li Qizhen would believe her words.

"You are?" Li Qizhen asked, puzzled.

Wang Lingling looked at him incredulously. She wanted to spill all her grievances but held back her frustration, explaining, "I’m Wang Lingling, a former colleague of Stella Ling. Don’t you remember? We met at Lin Yan Tower."

Li Qizhen recalled who she was—the woman who had tried to steal Stella's credit. He didn’t have a good impression of her and suppressed all his emotions, turning to leave without further conversation.

Feeling ignored, Wang Lingling wanted to cry. She continued to talk about Stella, hoping to sway Li Qizhen. "She hasn’t dated anyone for four years in college and avoids contact with men. She truly is incapable of love; there’s no future with her!"

The phrase "there's no future" struck a nerve with Li Qizhen. He turned back, coldly replying, "It’s none of your business!"

Seeing him turn away without a hint of hesitation shattered Wang Lingling’s composure. 

She covered her face and squatted down, sobbing uncontrollably.

What was happening?

Not just Li Qizhen, but even that handsome guy who brought flowers to the school this morning!

Why did all these quality men like Stella Ling?! Were they blind?

Wang Lingling suddenly looked up, recalling the harsh words Stella once said to her at work.

Could it be that Stella wasn’t lying? Was she truly on the same level as Li Qizhen?

No wonder when she returned to the office, she heard colleagues gossiping about Stella being a rich girl.

She had scoffed at them then, thinking they were foolish to be deceived.

Wang Lingling remembered a comment under a post she found while searching for tips on dating wealthy men.

"Ordinary people shouldn’t dream. To marry into a wealthy family, you need to be stunningly beautiful and emotionally intelligent. Otherwise, you’ll only be a plaything, unable to go past the marriage barrier. The fairy tale of the Cinderella marrying into a wealthy family only happens in cheesy romances. In reality, wealthy men only marry women from similar backgrounds. Don’t forget, even Cinderella was a noble. We women must empower ourselves and not always rely on others. We should create wealth with our own hands and live the lives we desire! It’s much more satisfying to spend money earned by ourselves!"

Wang Lingling, deeply vain, instinctively brushed off the last sentence, but she couldn't help but feel regret. "So Stella really is a rich girl, and Li Qizhen is pursuing her because of their social standing!"

"Damn! If I had known she was that wealthy, I would have treated her better and asked her to introduce me to a boyfriend!" 

Wang Lingling cursed inwardly. 

She could give up on Li Qizhen, but there were plenty of other wealthy men in the world. If one wouldn’t work out, she could pursue another!

With that thought, she wiped her tears and stood up, heading home.

She needed to return and dive deeper into those posts about dating wealthy men.

She refused to believe that she would never touch the edge of the upper class in her life!

Before boarding, Stella remembered she hadn’t deleted Li Qizhen from WeChat. She immediately took out her phone and blacklisted him.

"Ha~"

Stella sighed, contemplating what she would miss the most about leaving Beijing.

It had to be the apartment she rented for three months near Meixiang Park. 

She hadn’t even lived there for a month, and the money was non-refundable.

Just thinking about it made her feel frustrated.

Oh well, at least she still had the monthly task funds left to spend, so she should consider how to use that money first.

For today’s daily task, after buying a flower bouquet for 2,148 yuan, she stored the remaining funds onto a Walmart shopping card.

With 50 million yuan in monthly task funds, Stella had no idea where to allocate it.

She never imagined she would have a day where she struggled with how to spend money.

After disembarking, Stella immediately deposited the money into Xingchen Entertainment’s main account.

Feeling a bit exhausted, she didn’t want to ponder over where to spend the funds anymore. This money would serve as operational capital for her company.

Thinking it over, she had already invested 200 million into starting this entertainment company.

Stella couldn’t help but worry if an ordinary person like her could successfully manage an entertainment venture. 

"Stella, time to draw a prize! The rewards for the monthly task might be substantial!" 

At the sound, Stella quickly decided to draw.

Would she finally get a guide on how to manage an entertainment company?

Come on, Celestial Fortune, give me something good!

No, no, no! 

She couldn’t let the potential rewards blind her!

She still wanted the skill to conceal her luck!

The prize drawing wheel was divided into 16 sections, offering the same generous rewards as the initial beginner package.

There were 8 cash rewards, 6 physical rewards, and 2 random skill rewards.

Stella gazed at the massive 500-square-meter villa in the physical rewards section and suddenly reconsidered her target.

No! She had to stay firm!

Give me the skill to conceal my luck!

Stella shouted in her heart, wanting the Celestial Fortune to feel her seriousness.

Clicking to draw, the pointer spun rapidly before finally slowing to a stop in the physical reward zone.

Instead of the villa, it landed on a laptop.

A laptop connecting parallel universes—entertainment limited edition? 

What a strange name.

Stella clicked on the reward area, and a message unfolded before her eyes.

**Laptop Connecting Parallel Universes**—This laptop can connect to parallel universes on Earth, allowing the host to view all entertainment pieces from those parallel worlds for up to 8 hours a day.

Stella was stunned; even parallel universes were involved now!

The entertainment works from those parallel universes must be different from those in her world. So, was the Celestial Fortune suggesting she copy them?

"Ahem! Can you not say it so plainly? It’s about transporting and sharing excellent entertainment works from parallel universes!" 

The system explained.

Stella: "..."

Once back in her ultra-luxurious presidential suite, she ordered a cream cake takeaway for the Celestial Fortune before clicking to claim her physical reward.

She ran her fingers over the chipped Apple logo on the laptop, feeling an uncanny resemblance to her own fruit-branded laptop.

Stella powered on the laptop and began exploring the entertainment works from the parallel universe.

Since she wanted to form a girl group, she primarily focused on girl group works from the parallel universe.

After watching for three hours, Stella couldn’t help but marvel at how impressive the girl group works from the parallel universe were.

However, the mainstream market was still dominated by the Han Kingdom, and her country’s girl groups lacked global impact, only thriving domestically.

In the parallel world’s Han Kingdom, there were idols like Yuan Fei who worked in the Han Kingdom, with a few even gaining tremendous popularity there.

Nevertheless, after returning home, those idols gradually faded from the spotlight, transitioning into film and television, losing the heat they once enjoyed.

The root cause was that the Huayi entertainment scene lacked a stage.

It seemed the entertainment industry in her country had no intention of genuinely investing in stages.

Every time they attempted to do so, it was always half-hearted, resulting in groups that lacked a clear concept—some cool girls dancing to sweet songs, while sweet girls tried to act tough, leading to a jumbled mess.

Even when they finally built a popular girl group, the members would only come together briefly before scattering to film, only to receive criticism for their lackluster acting.

Moreover, the later development of Huayi was quite distorted, with most people in the industry exuding an air of superiority, churning out mediocre films to deceive the audience. Once criticized by viewers, they would blame the audience for their lack of taste and even start cursing their benefactors.

Calling the public "commoners," who do they think they are?
