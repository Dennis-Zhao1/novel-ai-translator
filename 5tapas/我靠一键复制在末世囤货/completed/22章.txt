**Ginger Duck and Sautéed Eel**

Taishu Jiyu's voice rose in disbelief. "This is impossible! How could this be happening?" 

No wonder! No wonder!!

Mang's bloodline lies within Blue Star, and so does Taishu's...

When she met Coco Wen, she hadn’t sensed any spiritual energy. It all made sense if it was Mang's bloodline…

Without undergoing the cleansing of the Taishu bloodline, how could it stand up to the activated first layer of Mang's bloodline?

She was puzzled by the sheer coincidence of it all!

Though Taishu Jiyu vocally expressed her disbelief, deep down, she was already convinced.

"This matter cannot reach the Parliament!" Taishu Jiyu narrowed her eyes at Ji He. If the Taishu bloodline and Mang's bloodline were indeed connected, the Parliament would undoubtedly want to eliminate Coco Wen, putting her in even greater danger.

She had previously considered cooperating with Ji He, yet now it seemed they were truly tied together. Given Ji He’s connections, he would always side with Mang's bloodline while she was determined to protect the Taishu family's lineage.

What a mess!

Even Taishu Jiyu, usually regal and commanding, sighed internally.

Ji He glanced at Taishu Jiyu as if to say, "Am I not aware?”

“The location of Blue Star has been blocked by your lordship; the Blue Star plan has just been initiated. We still have over a year.”

The Blue Star plan was essentially the eradication of humanity. The resources of the Ailan star system were shared between the Taishu family and the Parliament. Although the royal family had weakened in recent years, their historical significance meant the Parliament couldn't act too openly against them. Thus, to acquire more resources, their only option was to plunder from other planets.

Therefore, the underdeveloped Earth became their target. Once the native inhabitants were eliminated, they would send forces to seize Earth and strip it of its resources.

Every operation would be tailored to the planet's conditions.

In recent years, due to the popular support for the Parliament among the interstellar populace, the Taishu family had to bide its time in the face of public opinion. The two factions were currently in mutual disdain yet were cautious not to take drastic actions.

"Understood," Ji He acknowledged, then turned to leave.

With a sigh, Taishu Jiyu returned to her quarters.

Meanwhile, Coco Wen was in a delightful mood—not just because she had obtained a tranquil stone, which, while not useful to her, still represented a coveted superpower trinket, but also due to how lovely Miss Ji was! Life was too mundane in this apocalypse, and a little more beauty could lift anyone's spirits!

Coco decided to cook a special dinner to treat Miss Ji, mainly because she was craving the Min Nan-style Ginger Duck and Shanghainese Sautéed Eel.

Ginger Duck was perfect for the current chilly weather, warming the stomach and warding off the cold. Those who loved ginger would enjoy it; those who didn’t might find it challenging, but to each their own.

Coco remembered enjoying Ginger Duck from her mother's kitchen before she passed away, recalling how delicious it had been.

Since they were four people dining, Coco chopped up an entire duck into evenly sized pieces and blanched them.

Using old ginger was essential for the right flavor; she sliced the ginger into thin pieces.

In a pot, she poured sesame oil and added the ginger slices, frying them slowly over low heat until fragrant before removing them.

Next, she tossed in the blanched duck pieces, stirring them to evaporate the moisture. She added three tablespoons of soy sauce, half a tablespoon of sugar, and half a tablespoon of salt, mixing everything well.

Then she returned the fried ginger slices to the pot, pouring in rice wine and covering the pot—Ginger Duck shouldn’t have a drop of water added.

She let it simmer for an hour over medium-low heat, finishing by raising the heat to evaporate any remaining liquid until only oil remained at the bottom of the pot. This was when the Ginger Duck would smell its best!

Jinbao, her cat, had already caught the scent of the meat, scampering around Coco’s feet, tail brushing against her legs.

“Meow~”

Since Coco was busy cooking, she didn’t pet Jinbao but had intentionally set aside a piece of raw meat for her, placing it in Jinbao’s bowl.

Jinbao hurried over, happily munching away.

Coco placed the Ginger Duck aside to keep it warm and began preparing the Sautéed Eel.

As the saying goes, "In summer, eating eel is as good as ginseng."

Though it was traditionally a summer dish, Coco couldn’t resist the temptation. She remembered a classmate from high school who brought this very dish for lunch—the aroma lingered, making her rush home to ask her family cook to make it, and it had turned out delicious!

This was her first time making Sautéed Eel herself. Although she had a whole, albeit deceased eel from the pantry, she braced herself.

Staring at the eel that resembled a snake, she took a deep breath, grabbed scissors, and cut open its belly. Then, she carefully pushed the scissors alongside the eel's spine, gently slicing along to remove the bones, leaving behind clean fillets.

Upon catching the smell of the eel, Jinbao abandoned the duck pieces, darting over and starting to bug Coco again.

“Meow~”

“How greedy you are, little cat!” Coco teased, giving Jinbao a gentle poke on the head.

“Meow!”

Despite her words, Coco took a piece of eel, cut it into suitable morsels for Jinbao, and set them in her bowl. Tonight, there was no need for cat food.

After feeding Jinbao, Coco cut the remaining eel into finger-length pieces.

To make the Sautéed Eel, one needed to achieve three levels of transparency: 

1. The ginger and scallions should be fully sautéed!
2. The rice wine should be fully absorbed!
3. The eel should fully cook over low heat!

Coco poured oil into the pot. Once hot, she added minced ginger and garlic, stir-frying until they turned golden and fragrant. Then, she introduced a crucial ingredient—lard, to enhance the flavor and mask any fishy scent from the eel.

She added the cut eel fillets, stir-frying briefly before drizzling in a swirl of rice wine; lowering the heat, she covered the pot, letting it simmer for fifteen seconds.

After that, she added two tablespoons of dark soy sauce, a pinch of salt, and half a bowl of water, mixing well. Then came two tablespoons of sugar, and she stirred everything until combined.

Next, she let it cook for another fifteen seconds, adding white pepper, sesame oil, and a splash of vinegar. To finish, she thickened it with a cornstarch slurry, stirring a bit more before it was ready to serve!

Always remember to sprinkle chopped green onions over the top before serving—the soul of the dish!

Coco couldn’t help but sneak a taste, and it was just as delicious as she remembered!

Since today’s meal had a sweeter profile, Coco planned to add a spicy dish and a cold salad to balance things out.
