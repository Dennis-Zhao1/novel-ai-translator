The First Guest of the Warm Inn

As Lucy was enjoying her days, the Warm Inn welcomed its very first guest.

On this day, Clara Joy was grooming her pet, Goldie, when the voice of Starfall suddenly echoed: “Master, a lady in a black dress is approaching the entrance of the Warm Inn.”

Clara stopped grooming Goldie, her eyes wide with shock. “A… black dress?”

She looked out the window, noting that the snow was still heavy and the wind was biting cold—was this really the extreme cold period? Who would wear a dress in this weather? Could it be… another alien like Mr. Ji?

Ever since she learned that Ethan was an interstellar alien, Clara had been observing him, curious to see how extraterrestrial beings differed from Earthlings. She spent several days scrutinizing him but couldn’t quite identify any notable differences, other than noticing that he seemed to withstand the cold better than anyone else.

Although Clara had experienced a significant boost in physical ability thanks to the mysterious red potion she had consumed, she still bundled up in a down jacket and warm clothes—unlike Ethan, who only wore a single layer.

With the thought that the approaching person might be another alien, Clara donned a white down coat that reached her feet, wrapped a red scarf around her neck, and topped it off with a matching beanie. On her feet were thick, waterproof red snow boots.

Having replicated all the potions in the inn's space, Clara had taken a bottle of the red potion which activated her body’s potential. She had once been able to punch through a sandbag; now, she could demolish a wall with a single blow.

Now, when she dressed, she no longer only considered warmth; she also began to care about looking good. After all, Ethan had once jokingly referred to her as looking like a “scruffy beggar.”

Hmph! She, Clara Joy, was in the prime of her beauty!

Her slim figure was perfectly wrapped in the white coat, which didn’t make her look bulky. The red scarf and beanie made her radiate an exquisite charm. With her delicate brows, petite nose, and charming almond-shaped eyes that sparkled with a hint of mischief, she appeared lively, energetic, and irresistibly cute.

Before the apocalypse, Clara already fit the profile of a cute beauty, even if she had always dreamt of being a sultry diva.

Once she was ready, Clara hopped into the interstellar vehicle that Ethan had previously gifted her, thinking that if one could ride comfortably, why walk?

At the entrance, Tai Shu Ji Yu gazed up at the large red characters that read "Warm Inn." The surrounding fairy lights twinkled, responding to the glowing runes on her forehead.

“This is the place, little one,” Tai Shu Ji Yu mumbled.

Even though that madman from Star Building had hidden the location of Blue Star, she had her methods to arrive. The Tai Shu bloodline could never be allowed to go to waste, especially with the bloodline of Mang also present.

Sensing that the madman was inside, Tai Shu Ji Yu felt a flicker of curiosity—why was he here?

However, this time Tai Shu Ji Yu did not turn to leave. After all, she and he were on the same side this time.

Just as she was about to enter the inn, Clara’s interstellar vehicle glided to a stop.

“Destination reached, have a pleasant journey!” the car announced, its door opening automatically. As Clara stepped out, she caught sight of Tai Shu Ji Yu at the entrance and felt her heart skip a beat.

Wow! Now she understood the difference of aliens!

So beautiful!

Both Ethan and Tai Shu Ji Yu were stunning, beyond compare.

Tai Shu Ji Yu’s black dress swirled slightly in the snowy breeze, her softly curled long hair flowed behind her, snowflakes gently fell, speckling her dark dress and hair with a touch of brightness.

The mysterious runes on her forehead twinkled, casting ripples in her captivating eyes—slightly upturned at the corners, they held a hypnotic allure. Her red lips curled into a mischievous smile, resembling a Western goddess descended to Earth, ethereal yet beguiling.

Clara stood there, her heart racing: Ahhhhh! She was the type of sultry diva I adore!

Sister! Let’s be close!!! I can do it!

Tai Shu Ji Yu observed the girl stepping out of the interstellar car and raised an eyebrow. That madman actually gave his vehicle to someone else? Though this someone was part of her own family.

Then she turned her gaze to Clara. So this is the bloodline of the Tai Shu family?

Tai Shu Ji Yu rubbed the ring on her finger.

The girl, dressed in a red scarf and beanie, had a glimmer of mischief in her eyes, her lips slightly pursed as if she was excited, with a hint of rosy blush on her cheeks.

Tai Shu Ji Yu thought to herself, She looks like a soft and harmless Persian cat.

“Are you here to stay at the inn?” Clara boldly asked.

She had to convince this beauty to stay! For reasons she couldn’t explain, Clara felt a strange sense of closeness towards Tai Shu Ji Yu, as if her subconscious was urging her to keep her around.

Clara nervously clenched her fists, her innocent almond eyes blinking eagerly at Tai Shu Ji Yu, afraid the other party would refuse.

Tai Shu Ji Yu paused for a moment, then glanced at the “Warm Inn” sign again.

After a moment of contemplation, her red lips smiled gently, “Yes, I am here to stay.”

It seemed like the bloodline of the Tai Shu family had not yet fully activated; better to let her stay for now.

Clara felt like her heart had been struck by an arrow—her sister’s smile made her even more beautiful…

A wide grin spread across Clara’s face as she opened the interstellar vehicle. “Come on! Let’s go check you in!”

Tai Shu Ji Yu hesitated for a second before stepping into the vehicle.

Who would have thought she would ever find herself riding in Ethan’s interstellar car…

She sighed internally.

The interstellar vehicle pulled up to Clara's villa, and she led Tai Shu Ji Yu inside.

Ethan, who had been in the room, was infrequently sitting in the living room this time.

“Mr. Ji, you’re also here! Perfect timing; we have a new guest!” Clara called out.

She then turned to introduce Tai Shu Ji Yu. “This is… um…” Clara hesitated for a moment.

“Ji Yu,” Tai Shu Ji Yu provided.

“Yes, this is Ms. Ji,” Clara responded, realizing she had almost forgotten to ask her name.

Turning to introduce Ethan, she said, "This is Ethan, Mr. Ji."

Ethan remained still, but Clara was used to it by now.

Xu Jin stepped out of the room as well. He often found himself at the forefront of events, quickly emerging whenever something unusual happened.

Clara introduced Tai Shu Ji Yu to Xu Jin once again.

Over the past few days, she had already discussed working at the inn with Xu Jin, who had agreed. In return, Clara offered him some potions provided by Ethan.

However, it seemed Xu Jin was more captivated by Goldie than anything else; Clara suspected he might have stayed because of the adorable creature.

Before she could explain further about the potions and the inn's supplies, Xu Jin straightforwardly stated, “I just want to stay here. You can say what you'd like, and if there's anything you don’t want to share, I won't pry.”

Clara silently gave Xu Jin a thumbs-up in her mind—now that was understanding! So she chose not to elaborate.

After everyone had introduced themselves, Clara immediately registered Tai Shu Ji Yu's information into the system via Little Ai.

That’s right! Little Ai 3088 was the registration system for the entire inn. Right now, it was under Starfall's control, with security systems installed throughout the inn's perimeter.

Anyone who stepped over the threshold without being in the database would be shot to bits by Little Ai.

Every guest would have their image registered so that they could be recognized automatically upon entry.

Every floor's entrance was fitted with this system as well; guests wouldn’t need keys; they just had to stand by the door.

Visitors could enter upon the approval of the host.

It could be said that the Warm Inn had transformed into an advanced establishment with high intelligence and information technology.
