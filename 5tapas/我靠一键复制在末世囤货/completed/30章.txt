Chapter 1: A Misunderstanding in the Snow

As the three of them emerged from the warehouse, it was nearly noon, and they decided to explore other parts of S City.

"Boss, it's them! They definitely have food!" 

Suddenly, a group of ragged men rushed towards them, their clothes layered haphazardly, gloves on their hands, hair disheveled, and faces pale. Without exception, they were all men, shivering in the snow yet brandishing knives at Wen Keke and her companions in a desperate attempt to rob them.

One particularly thin guy, looking as if he might float away any moment, turned to a burly man standing next to him. 

Wen Keke couldn't help but twitch her mouth at the sight of these desperate men, whose legs seemed to wobble but were still intent on robbing her.

The leader of the group, wrapped in layers of clothing, donned a woman’s knitted hat and had much of his face covered by a scarf, revealing only a pair of fierce eyes. 

With a chipped knife aimed threateningly at Wen Keke and her friends, he shouted, “You three, hand over all your food! Otherwise, don’t blame us for being rude!”

Ji He was about to step forward, but Wen Keke was quick to grab his arm. Ji He looked down at her hand, and she immediately retracted it, chuckling nervously, "Let me handle this! Give me a chance!"

Ji He looked at the eager Wen Keke, a hint of amusement crossing his face. "Are you sure?"

Wen Keke nodded vigorously like a garlic sprout being mashed. "Absolutely sure!"

The gang members, noticing the man and woman chatting instead of panicking, wore even more menacing expressions. The leader exchanged a look with one of his companions, who nodded in acknowledgment.

In a flash, the group lunged at Wen Keke and her friends with their knives drawn.

Without hesitation, Wen Keke kicked the first attacker coming from the left, sending him crashing backwards to the ground, unable to rise. Then she swung her arm to the right, breaking another man's hand.

Seeing two of their companions taken down so swiftly, the remaining attackers hesitated, but the leader bellowed, “What are you afraid of! Attack together! They must have lots of food!”

Encouraged by the lure of food, the others’ resolve stiffened, and they charged at Wen Keke.

Wen Keke welcomed them, thinking, "Perfect timing!"

She dashed toward the oncoming crowd, performing a series of precise fighting techniques:
- Strike with the heel!
- Elbow to the knee!
- Deflect the knife with the arm!
- Side thrust to the throat!

Her display of martial arts was a stunning blend of power and grace. Ji He watched with a slight smile as Wen Keke fought, while Tai Shu Ji Yu mused that this little kitten truly embodied the spirit of the Tai Shu clan.

After dispatching the last of the attackers, Wen Keke paused, breathing heavily, her face flushed with excitement. She couldn’t help but feel proud of her skills.

With a triumphant grin, she turned to Ji Yu and Ji He, lifting her head with a smirk, “See! I’m pretty great!”

Tai Shu Ji Yu walked over and ruffled Wen Keke's hair. “You are the strongest little kitten.”

Wen Keke's cheeks flushed deeper, her eyes sparkling at the compliment, making her irresistibly cute.

Meanwhile, Xing Yun, who had been standing to the side, quietly asked, “Master, why didn’t you let Xing Yun help? I could have transformed into many weapons.”

Wen Keke reassured him, “Xing Yun, did you notice that they kept altering their swings? They were trying not to hurt me, which means they aren't truly evil. Just teach them a lesson. If you showed up, they definitely wouldn’t survive—you’re too powerful! It hasn’t come to a life-or-death situation yet!”

Xing Yun blushed slightly. “I know, Master!”

Feeling flattered, Wen Keke turned her attention back to the now-recovering attackers, who were helping each other up and preparing to flee. This was their first attempt at robbery; who would willingly resort to such measures unless in dire need? Spotting the trio, who looked better off, they thought a small heist would be easy—only to be knocked down decisively.

Hu Laosan, the leader of the group, let out a heavy sigh. “Hey, you guys, stop!” Wen Keke shouted at them.

Hu Laosan jumped, as if invigorated. His injured hand felt almost healed. “Let’s go!” he yelled to his companions.

No way! Did she plan to beat them while they were down? They hadn’t harmed her at all!

The wounded group fled with unmatched speed. 

Wen Keke furrowed her brow at their sudden sprint. Where's the fire? She glanced at the professor’s credential she had picked up earlier and contemplated returning it. After all, she was a good Samaritan.

Curiously, she opened it to look.

First was the white background photo, showcasing a refined-looking man with a dignified demeanor, respectable and teacher-like. Below the photo were the details:

**Certificate Holder: Hu Qingyun  
Gender: Male  
…  
Age: 46  
Teaching Discipline: Water Conservancy Engineering**

Wen Keke's eyes sparkled when she saw the teaching discipline. Could it be this easy?

“Ji, Ge, Jie, Ji He! That person can repair the flood dam!!! Let’s go find them!” 

She quickly commanded Xing Yun to lock onto the group’s location, sprinting after them, knowing they couldn't have gone too far given their injuries.

Despite Ji He’s calm demeanor, he kept pace behind her.

Once they spotted the fleeing group’s figures ahead, she shouted, “Hey! Stop right there!”

Hu Laosan felt a moment of relief finally evaporate as he turned to see Wen Keke had chased after them, equally determined to keep running. 

Wen Keke, swift and agile, intercepted them. 

“Why are you running?” she asked, puzzled, standing before them.

Hu Laosan and his crew exchanged glances, looking pale. Eventually, Hu Laosan stepped up to speak, “What do you want? We’ve already been beaten by you; don’t push your luck!”

He delivered his lines with a strong tone, but the words were weak!

Wen Keke held up the professor’s credential and asked, “Who is Hu Qingyun?”

The group exchanged confused looks, everyone shaking their heads in unison. “No idea. There is no Hu Qingyun here!”

Wen Keke narrowed her eyes, and Xing Yun morphed into a laser cannon, its barrel pointed at them, declaring firmly, “Who is Hu Qingyun?”

Seeing the unearthly transformation, the gang trembled in terror. “What kind of high-tech is that? I've never seen anything like it!”

Finally gathering their courage, the leader stepped forward. “That’s me! What do you want from me?”

He was ready to die! After all, this was the apocalypse; he no longer wanted to live!

His companions gritted their teeth and followed suit, stepping forward to join him. “We can’t let the boss die alone for us; count me in!”

“Me too!” they echoed.

“That goes for me!”

…

Wen Keke stared at the group acting as if they had just downed a few shots of adrenaline, all shouting about dying, and couldn’t help but wonder if she was indeed a monster. Was she really that terrifying?

“Oh, you are!” said they. Who else would aim a cannon at someone for no reason? (Shivering with fear)

Wen Keke put away Xing Yun and approached Hu Laosan, a friendly smile plastered on her face. “So, you are Hu Qingyun?”
