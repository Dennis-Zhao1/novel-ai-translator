**Am I really such an impulsive person?**

When Coco Wen stepped out of the interstellar vehicle, she looked at the woman across from Ji He. She pushed aside the tiny bit of displeasure in her heart, standing in front of Ji He with a bright smile directed at the woman opposite her: 

“Miss, oh no, I should say ‘Auntie,’ didn’t you take a look in the mirror before you left? Your face... is quite creative! Just look at your eyes—tut... how to put this, sigh! It must be tough for you to even see the world clearly. 

Oh! And your nose is great, you must not be short of air to breathe—just look at those nostrils, pointing to the sky! As for your mouth... my goodness! You don’t eat children at night, do you?”

Coco feigned a shocked expression, covering her mouth dramatically. 

Among the onlookers, a girl burst out laughing. She had long disapproved of this woman who shamelessly took things from several classmates. 

The woman in the red cotton jacket looked at Coco Wen, jealousy almost spilling from her eyes: “Who are you? What gives you the right to meddle in our affairs? Do you really think you can control normal friendships between men and women?”

Why was she so careful in this apocalyptic world, while the woman in front of her looked so clean and appeared to have enjoyed good meals? 

Liu Yan glared at Coco with venom in her eyes. 

Coco Wen chuckled in response to her words: “Hah! What did you just say? Did I hear you right? You say... you two have a normal friendship?”

Coco pointed at Ji He and then at Liu Yan, laughing as she added, “I’m not saying anything rude, but normal friendships should be based on mutual willingness, right? Just take a look—does he seem willing?”

Since Coco had arrived, Ji He had obediently stood behind her. Upon hearing Coco mention his name, he shook his head and said firmly, “Not willing!”

Coco gazed at Ji He; the sight of him being so obedient brought a smile to her face. 

Seeing Coco and the man she coveted exchanging looks, Liu Yan felt her teeth grinding in frustration. She had thought that her looks weren’t bad and that Ji He dressed nicely, so she aimed to entice him to secure a more comfortable life for herself. 

Now, that plan had been thwarted by the woman before her. 

“You! You two! You’re going too far! Ganging up on me? The government won’t ignore this! Who do you think you are!” 

Amidst the crowd, someone shouted, “Of course, the government won’t ignore it; who’s the shameless one here taking someone else’s stuff instead of getting their own?”

“Exactly! I heard this woman forcibly took things from several female students, making them cry!” 

“Right! People like her should be dealt with!” 

“And still has the nerve to ask who Coco is? Everyone knows Ms. Wen is the owner of the supermarket, what a joke!” 

“Ha ha ha! Just look at her! She probably doesn’t even know.”

Liu Yan’s eyes widened in shock as she heard someone say Coco was the supermarket owner, “What did you just say? She’s the owner of the supermarket?” 

The bold speaker replied without fear, “Yeah, everyone knows Ms. Wen is the owner.”

Liu Yan’s eyes flashed with anger, but she held it in, realizing this was someone she couldn’t afford to offend. She planned to turn and leave immediately. 

However, the girl who had laughed earlier stepped forward and blocked her: “Return what you took from my friend before you leave!”

Liu Yan tried to shove past the student, but the surrounding students closed in, shouting, “Yes! Give it back, and you can’t leave until you do!” 

“Hand it over!” 

Surrounded, Liu Yan found it impossible to escape. She had no choice but to pull the stolen items from her bag, tossing them into the crowd of students. Taking advantage of their distraction, she turned and ran. 

Meanwhile, Coco Wen led Ji He back to their villa. It wasn’t that Coco’s previous words had gone too far; it was that the woman had already done this more than once. Most of the customers at Coco’s supermarket were soldiers and students, who were often too polite to refuse a woman’s request. Some female students were directly robbed by Liu Yan, whose size and strength intimidated them, forcing many to lose their purchases in various ways. 

When Xu Jin discovered this, he immediately informed her. She hadn’t wanted to intervene since it was the apocalypse; they had to learn to fend for themselves. 

She didn’t expect it would involve Ji He, knowing he had a violent streak; she worried he might hurt the woman, which would lead to trouble, considering she was part of the Huaguo base. That’s why she had rushed over. 

Ji He followed Coco obediently, picking up on her unusual mood and deciding to be extra careful. 

Once back at the villa, Coco turned to Ji He, scrutinizing the handsome man in front of her, letting out a sigh in her heart. 

A man so beautiful, she hadn’t even dared to think of him in such a way, so how could that woman? 

Ji He felt uncomfortable under Coco’s gaze, his ears turning red, puzzled by why she was looking at him like that. 

“Why... why are you looking at me like that?” Ji He asked shyly. 

Coco snapped out of her reverie, realizing she had been staring too long. She replied, “Oh, nothing, just wanted to say if you encounter something like that again, come find me. Don’t act rashly.” 

Coco smiled and gently patted Ji He’s arm, excited to have touched such a handsome person. 

For some reason, Ji He felt a bit dejected as he responded with a simple, “Oh.” 

Then he turned and retreated to his room. 

Coco watched his retreating figure in confusion, wondering why Ji He, who had just been so obedient, now exuded an air of dejection. She had just helped him, after all! 

Coco didn’t understand Ji He’s thoughts; he was battling with the idea that in Coco’s mind, he was seen as such a violent and impulsive person. He couldn’t help but think back to the punch he had thrown in her defense earlier, leaving him feeling oddly guilty. 

Outside, Coco was still on the phone with Lin Jiao Jiao. 

Oh right, the tech staff in Huaguo had fixed the signal, but it could only be used for short-range calls; they still couldn’t access the internet or make long-distance calls. 

They were planning to set up an internal network for base personnel once the infrastructure was ready. 

Consequently, Coco and Lin Jiao Jiao kept in touch via telephone every day. 

“Wen Wen, that woman has been forbidden from going outside. Once the rear mountain base is built, she’ll be sent there without a chance to escape,” Lin Jiao Jiao said over the line. 

“Jiao Jiao, is that why you called? To talk about that woman? Don’t you miss me at all?” Coco playfully asked. 

Truthfully, she didn’t care much about the woman because she knew the Huaguo base would provide a satisfactory resolution. After all, she was a VIP. 

On the other end of the line, Lin Jiao Jiao chuckled, replying, “Of course I miss you! I miss your cooking! They sent me a chicken today. When I come over tonight, can you make roast chicken for me?” 

Coco happily agreed, “Sure! Let’s have a barbecue party tonight!” 

After hanging up, Lin Jiao Jiao looked at her supplies, preparing to take everything to Coco’s place for their evening party, including the things Coco had sent her previously.
