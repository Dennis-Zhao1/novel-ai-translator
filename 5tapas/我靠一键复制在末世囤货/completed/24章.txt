**Points Redemption Machine**

Xu Jin felt perplexed, not understanding why Wen Ke Ke was looking at him with such a pitying gaze. He glanced at the girl, his confusion deepening.

Wen Ke Ke quickly lowered her head, pretending to eat, thinking to herself, "I must leave Xu Jin some self-esteem!"

Ji He soon realized the reason for Wen Ke Ke's strange look, but he chose not to explain and continued to eat, savoring the delicious dishes.

Hmm! The food today was particularly to his taste.

This was undoubtedly a delightful misunderstanding!

Tai Shu Ji Yu still wore a black dress, and Wen Ke Ke couldn't help but feel a chill at the sight of her. 

Curious about the sparkling symbol on Ji Yu's forehead, Wen Ke Ke wondered if it was an alien mark. However, she hesitated to ask directly, fearing it might be a taboo subject.

As soon as Tai Shu Ji Yu entered the villa, she caught a distinct aroma that made her nose itch but also felt oddly alluring, prompting her to taste the food.

Upon arriving at the second-floor dining room, she observed the dishes on the table with a flicker of interest in her eyes. Could she finally eat food that would elevate her soul?

Noticing a cup with a straw reserved for her, filled with something resembling milk, it had pink granules and a soft, slippery substance.

Tai Shu Ji Yu imitated Wen Ke Ke and took a small sip.

The flavor of strawberry milk tea burst in her mouth, reminiscent of a sweet first love, with tiny bits of strawberry dancing playfully all over her palate, escaping her grasp like mischievous little fairies.

Inside the cup was also a soft, creamy substance that melted upon contact, rich in its dairy aroma. Tai Shu Ji Yu squinted with delight; she had been captivated by this wonderful taste.

Decision made: she would stay here!

With the Blue Star plan still over a year away, she resolved to spend this time on Earth with the kittens.

Looking at the others, who were diving into a platter of spicy rabbit stew, Tai Shu Ji Yu quickly followed their lead and grabbed some meat.

She sniffed at the aroma, which was heavenly.

“Achoo—”

Tai Shu Ji Yu couldn't hold back a sneeze, causing Wen Ke Ke and the others to glance her way. Tai Shu Ji Yu was certain that the madman had made fun of her.

Hmph, she was not interested in a madman.

Putting the rabbit meat into her mouth, she experienced an unprecedented fiery sensation that made her eyes brighten.

She loved it!

Tai Shu Ji Yu hastened to grab more rabbit meat, joyfully savoring it with chili. 

When the stew's juices mixed with rice and rabbit meat, she discovered new levels of joy.

Soon, the spicy rabbit stew was completely devoured, and Ji He reached for the remaining ginger duck and stir-fried eel.

Tai Shu Ji Yu regretted not eating more of that dish as she looked at the last three, seeing that Ji He was not much slower in devouring the rabbit, she hastily joined in.

She picked up a piece of duck; with little effort, it broke apart easily into her bowl. Tai Shu Ji Yu again took the duck meat and placed it in her mouth.

Hmm~

It had a slight saltiness with a touch of ginger spiciness, a warming sensation that felt like drinking hot soup on a cold winter day, bringing comfort to her whole body.

The duck's unique fragrance was perfectly accentuated, making it yet another personal favorite!

She grabbed some stir-fried eel; its smooth texture melded perfectly with the fresh and juicy eel, bursting in flavor, prompting her to exclaim, "Delicious!"

Tai Shu Ji Yu ate many more slices of ginger duck and stir-fried eel, piling her bowl high with rice, and finally decided to try a bite of the cold mixed dish.

Hmm?

The pleasant sourness cut through the heaviness from the meat, serving as a perfect palate cleanser! Tai Shu Ji Yu’s queenly persona was starting to falter. 

The meal left all four of them thoroughly satisfied. Wen Ke Ke was overjoyed to have finally tasted her beloved ginger duck, while Xu Jin reflected on how there were still so many delicious dishes in the end times.

Ji He simply liked to eat, and it seemed that Tai Shu Ji Yu might become the next big eater.

Wen Ke Ke pondered how such a slim waist could house such an appetite.

She had only eaten one bowl of rice, and so had Xu Jin; the rest was devoured by Mr. Ji and Miss Ji.

Wen Ke Ke looked at Tai Shu Ji Yu with a mixture of surprise and disbelief.

Tai Shu Ji Yu elegantly wiped the grease from the corner of her mouth, lazily leaning back in her chair, her long dress cascading down her legs, revealing her fair, slender limbs.

Her eyes, half-closed from satisfaction, had their shadows accentuated by her elegantly curled lashes.

The symbol on her forehead seemed to glow with satisfaction, flickering more slowly. Unable to resist, Tai Shu Ji Yu gently pinched Wen Ke Ke's cheek.

After all, the little kitten’s frightened expression was just too adorable.

“Thank you, little kitten, for the treat; I really liked it~”

With that, Tai Shu Ji Yu headed downstairs, preparing to return to her room to message Wei Feng about her matters, while also tending to the issues on the central star.

Wen Ke Ke stood frozen in place, one hand covering her face.

After a while, she lowered her hand, revealing a crimson face, all from embarrassment.

After all, Ji Yu had been far too flirtatious just now; she could hardly handle it!

Wen Ke Ke shouted inwardly. 

Xu Jin quietly sat beside her, not daring to speak. The lady had seemed formidable, but… it seemed Mr. Ji had encountered a rival!

Xu Jin felt an inexplicable thrill—was this the joy of spectating a drama?

With Tai Shu Ji Yu’s arrival, Wen Ke Ke decided that one guest was still a guest and thought about reopening the supermarket. After all, her family's business before the apocalypse had yet to venture into food supplies.

Time to take action!

Previously, she had avoided touching the decorations in the supermarket, thinking they still looked fine, but one day, she accidentally bumped something, and the entire shelf shattered.

She had to retrieve shelves and various items from her space and reinstall them.

Outside the supermarket, Wen Ke Ke set up ten points redemption machines. Residents could exchange magma stones, ores, and other items for points—simply placing items on top allowed the machine to scan them automatically.

Then, depending on the quality, density, and other factors, the system would determine the number of points awarded. This way, no one would need to seek her out individually.

The points exchanged would be stored in each person’s information account.

The redeemed points could be used directly to purchase goods or to extend their stay; for instance, a 10-gram magma stone could be exchanged for a hundred points, and staying one day would cost ten points.

These machines were crafted by Xingyun; to create this redemption system, Wen Ke Ke had dismantled thirty copies of Xiao Ai from her space!

Every time a redemption machine was formed, three copies of Xiao Ai disappeared!

Guests didn’t need to rely on a person to process their points; products could only be taken from the shelf once their points were deducted by Xingyun.

This approach helped prevent theft, and if it did occur, Wen Ke Ke wouldn’t be too concerned since the entire supermarket was under Xingyun’s control. 

As the universe's only intelligent housekeeping weapon, Xingyun was formidable!
