**Back to the Pre-Apocalypse**

“Ahh~”  
My head hurts.  

Wendy Wu slowly opened her eyes, rubbing her temples. Didn't she already die? Is she still alive?  

Wendy turned her head and glanced around.  

Huh? Isn’t this her home before the apocalypse?!!!  

The room before her was bright and clean, with warm sunlight streaming through the large floor-to-ceiling windows, casting rays onto the cashmere rug on the ground.  

Wendy froze for a moment, then quickly scrambled to her feet and rushed to the window to look outside.  

The garden was filled with blooming flowers, green grass, and her cat, Goldie, was also there.  

Has she returned???  

Joy burst in Wendy's eyes as she quickly pulled her phone from her pocket to check the date.  
August 6, 2075.  

Just one more month! The apocalypse is coming in one month!  
She's returned to one month before the apocalypse!  

On September 6, 2075, a blizzard suddenly hit the sky. Many people died in their sleep that night, frozen, and transportation became a nightmare. The heavy snow caused buildings to collapse.  

Low-lying homes were submerged in the snow, and temperatures plummeted to minus forty or fifty degrees.  

One after another, many people froze to death. When people finally realized something was wrong, it was already too late; resources were scarce, and many people starved.  

This cold spell lasted for five months!  

After five months, the snow on the ground melted overnight.  
Floods came crashing in, leaving those who had endured the blizzard helpless against the rising waters.  

Survivors were drowned again, and the land area above water shrank to a mere one-tenth.  
The remaining humans floated for three months, and then the weather turned extremely hot.  

Dead bodies caused new types of viruses to emerge due to the intense heat. People had to cope with not only the sweltering temperatures but also fight against infectious diseases.  

Wendy herself had succumbed to illness during the hot period.  

In her last life, Wendy was the eldest daughter of the Wu family. Though her parents died in a plane accident, the family’s assets were enough to last her a lifetime.  
She had no close relatives or friends.  

When the apocalypse struck, Wendy was alone at home. Thankfully, the villa had a fireplace, and Wendy was generally cold-natured, so she had stockpiled warm clothing and supplies to barely survive the frigid temperatures.  

Moreover, since the villa was in the suburbs on a mountaintop, floods posed little threat to her.  
Unfortunately, during the extreme heat, the outbreak of infectious diseases spread rapidly in the air, and she ultimately fell ill and died.  

Wendy rushed downstairs, realizing that the housekeeper had already prepared dinner and gone home.  
Not fond of socializing, she had hired a nanny who would come daily to cook and clean, only returning home once done.  

Wendy quickly raced to the dining table and grabbed a soup dumpling, popping it into her mouth.  
Mmm~  

Wendy squinted her eyes in delight. It tasted so good. Though she had managed to survive a long time during the apocalypse, she typically ate whatever she could find, even resorting to eating mice when hunger struck. She never imagined that she would enjoy soup dumplings again.  

After finishing the dumpling in her mouth, Wendy sipped on some soy milk and peeled a marinated tea egg to devour.  
After a hearty meal, she returned to her room, preparing for her next steps.  

Money was not an issue for her.  
As for what to buy… Wendy took out a piece of paper and started jotting down everything she needed to prepare.  

Looking at the list filled with supplies, Wendy sighed, wishing she had a space like in those novels.  
Suddenly, Wendy found herself in a silvery-white place.  

Where is this???  

Wendy turned around, surrounded by shimmering silver. She started to walk in one direction, and after a long while, she finally reached a boundary. The silver surface felt elastic, but it towered out of view.  

Wendy stood still, recalling she had just wished for a space like that.  
Could it be that this is the space???  

Excitement welled up in Wendy! If she got a second chance at life, then having a space was certainly possible!  
Moreover, while this space had boundaries, it felt enormous and lofty.  

Wendy decided to try the classic method from novels, focusing her thoughts on wanting to exit, and suddenly, she was back in her room! She thought about going back in, and it worked again.  
So, the trigger for this space was her consciousness!  

Wendy dashed downstairs, grabbed a cup of hot water, and tested the passage of time in her new space. After placing the hot water inside, she quickly exited, planning to check back later.  

After stepping outside, she looked at her list of supplies again. Since she now had a space, she could buy whatever she wanted without holding back!  
Wendy pulled out her phone, diving into an online shopping app, and began placing orders: 100,000 boxes of instant noodles, 100,000 bottles of bottled water, and various foods, instant products, fresh fruits, and vegetables. She ordered everything available on the app!  

Plus, 100,000 thick blankets, padded coats, down jackets, boots, slippers, underwear, and other clothing items.  
Then she checked out summer clothing, pants, shoes, hats—another 100,000 orders. She didn’t stop there; she ordered every kind of cooling device—air conditioners, small fans, ice machines, large refrigerators, solar generators—10,000 of everything!  

Life preservers, inflatable boats, waterproof suits, tents… everything she could think of, she bought!  
For daily necessities, Wendy placed orders without hesitation, knowing those items would be needed daily!  

As for building materials, necessary and unnecessary... if it appeared on the app, Wendy clicked to buy it all!!!  
By the time she finished ordering, three hours had passed. Wendy entered her space again and found the hot water still freshly steaming. This space had time that stood still!  

Wendy grabbed her wallet and phone and casually picked a car from the garage before driving toward the city center.  
After parking in a lot, Wendy entered every restaurant, reserving a thousand tables at each, specifying her family warehouse as the delivery address for all.  

Not forgetting bubble tea, Wendy headed to the café on the fourth floor and ordered a thousand cups at each store!  
What else is missing?  

Sipping a bubble tea, Wendy pondered on a seat.  
Weapons! Yes! She still needed weapons!  

Recalling an old classmate who had resources in that field, she called them up.  
On the other end, her classmate agreed but mentioned they would need a day to gather the items because the quantity Wendy wanted was just too huge.  

Wendy hung up with a sigh of relief, running through her checklist once more to see if anything was missing.  
After several thorough checks, she returned to her house.  

Back in her bedroom, she opened the spicy crawfish and cola she had just ordered outside, turned on her iPad, and started to watch a variety show while munching on her food.  
Life felt so carefree and enjoyable, yet this sense of peace would vanish in just a month.  

Shaking off those thoughts, in this life, she just wanted to live well.  
Popping open another crawfish, she savored the rich flavors, then took a big gulp of icy cola!  
So satisfying!
