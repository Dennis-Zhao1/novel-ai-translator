**Starfall in the Apocalypse**

One month before the apocalypse, Andrew Lin received a directive from the central government, instructing him to head to D City to prepare for the impending crisis.

As the apocalypse descended, Andrew Lin swiftly gathered the survivors from D City and nearby areas into the military base that had been meticulously prepared.

Originally, the supplies were sufficient to last over a year without worry, but recently, people from the Zhao family, armed with advanced weaponry, raided the base, depleting nearly all of their resources. 

Many military personnel suffered casualties, leaving the military base severely weakened. The remaining supplies were scarce for the survivors, and tensions began to rise among the group. Initially, Andrew managed to suppress dissenting voices, but as resources dwindled, patience wore thin.

Finally, help was on the way!

January 4, 2076.

A massive black beast glided steadily across the floodwaters toward the military base in D City. 

“Commander Lin! We've received news from headquarters! I can see the ship!” A young man named Jason Wu exclaimed excitedly to Andrew, who stood nearby.

It’s here! It’s finally here!

“There’s food! There’s food!”

“We can survive! We’ll live!”

“Where’s the food! Where’s the food?”

Survivors at the military base crowded along the walls, gazing longingly at the incoming starship, some with tears in their eyes, others shouting in joy, while some were in such a daze that all they could think of was food.

Upon closer inspection, every survivor's face was gaunt, their eye sockets sunken, looking terribly malnourished.

Andrew Lin's heart swelled with relief at the sight of the giant black vessel moving across the flood, but he soon succumbed to unconsciousness.

“Commander! Where is the doctor? Quick!” Jason shouted, quickly catching Andrew as he began to fall, while the crowd erupted in chaos.

“Where’s the doctor? Where’s Dr. Wang?”

“Hurry, make way! Dr. Wang is coming!”

Through the throng, a thin man wearing glasses struggled to push through, adjusting his glasses while shouting, “Make way! Make way! Everyone, disperse and let the air circulate, don’t crowd together!”

Dr. Wang finally reached Andrew Lin's side.

Jason anxiously asked, “Dr. Wang, what happened to the commander? He's always been healthy and never faints!”

Dr. Wang, equally worried yet helpless, replied, “There’s a severe lack of supplies and medical equipment… I can’t check the commander's condition right now.”

Although Jason was desperate, he realized how depleted the base was of resources and could only place his hopes on headquarters. With that thought, he turned his gaze back toward the approaching starship.

Onboard the vessel, a woman named Kelly Wen noticed the crowd gathered at the military base and sensed trouble, so she urged the ship to increase its speed.

At the flood defenses of the military base, General Wei was organizing a team of ten thousand soldiers to unload supplies while distributing all available ready-to-eat meals.

Jason quickly approached General Wei, reporting, “Sir! General Wei, Commander Lin just fainted! We don’t have any medical supplies left in the base!”

“What?” General Wei halted his tasks, summoning the doctors brought along to hurry down and attend to Andrew Lin.

As Kelly and her companions entered the military base, they saw a disheveled crowd, many looking haggard and emaciated. They opened the food they received without a second glance, shoving it into their mouths and gulping it down hurriedly.

Some soldiers, still youthful in appearance, were devouring their portions ravenously.

As they walked through the scene, Kelly already witnessed at least five instances of choking due to people eating too quickly.

Upon seeing Kelly and her group, the hungry faces lacked any expression, their eyes fixated solely on food.

“Let go! That’s mine!” a young voice suddenly rang out.

Unfazed, the crowd continued to eat without reacting as Kelly turned to see a young boy, around seven or eight years old, clutching a bag of freshly issued bread with a fierce grip, his fingers turning red while glaring at someone across from him.

On the other side stood a scruffy teenager, about thirteen or fourteen, voraciously munching on a piece of bread, while one hand was occupied prying a piece away from the younger boy.

“You can’t eat much anyway, just share a little with me!” the teenager sneered, completely disregarding the boy’s protests.

Frowning, Jason stepped in, grasping the teenager's wrist to make him release his grip.

“Can’t you hear? What are you doing, robbing him?”

Years of military training lent Jason a fierce aura, causing the bread-snatching teen to flinch and release his hold, muttering, “So what if it is? There aren’t any cops around…”

Then, fearing Jason might retaliate, he bolted away.

The young boy quickly reclaimed his bread, tearing it open and shoving it into his mouth without so much as a word of thanks to Jason.

Watching the boy gorge himself and observing the indifference of the surrounding crowd, Jason frowned deeply—it seemed the situation in D City was dire...

Kelly retracted her gaze and continued her way forward, while her companion Lily Xu remarked with a smile, “I thought you would step in there.”

Kelly paused briefly before recovering her composure, “They don’t have any sense of order left. There’s no point in intervening; it’s a law of the jungle now. To change the state of affairs, we must restore their previous way of life and their sense of order. Besides, Captain Jason has already thought of that, so I won’t bother.”

Kelly’s voice became playful in the end.

Lily sighed deeply—it was clear that the true challenges of this apocalypse loomed ahead!

Meanwhile, General Wei stood anxiously outside the room where the doctor had just emerged, asking, “Doctor, how’s Lin doing?”

The doctor removed his stethoscope and replied, “He’s fine; Commander Lin just fainted from hunger and has been suffering from long-term malnutrition. He needs to be replenished.”

General Wei nodded in relief, “As long as it’s not serious.”

He pushed open the door to the room, which was simple with only a bed and a small table. 

Looking at Lin, who had just regained consciousness, General Wei burst into laughter, “I never thought I’d see you faint from hunger, Andrew! You used to be as strong as an ox!”

Seeing that it was General Wei, Andrew chuckled in response, “Well, isn’t it all so that you could come to my rescue? Otherwise, when would it have been your turn to bring me supplies?”

General Wei pulled a chair beside the bed and produced a bowl of porridge prepared by the soldiers.

Andrew’s eyes brightened as he fixated on the porridge.

General Wei chuckled, handing the bowl to Andrew, “Here, you eat by yourself. If it’s not enough, there’s more.”

He then retrieved several steamed buns, offering them to Andrew.
