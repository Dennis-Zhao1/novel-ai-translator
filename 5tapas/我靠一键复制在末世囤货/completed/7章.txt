**Gray Wolf**

After lunch, Emily Wang prepared to enter her space to organize some things since she hadn't tidied it up much lately. 

Upon entering, the first thing she noticed was the neatly arranged rows of shelves. Each shelf was clearly labeled—clothes, shoes, pants, fruits, rice, flour, and so on, with very specific categories. Behind each sign was a shelf filled with corresponding items, and behind those shelves were the remaining items, all neatly organized.

As she walked towards the back, she saw piles of snow stacked like mountains, with a simple shower setup Emily had made next to it. She rubbed her chin thoughtfully. Recently, she had discovered a new function of her space: as long as she focused her mind, the items within her space would respond to her will. Otherwise, it would be exhausting to arrange them all one by one. Was this what they called telekinesis?

Then… could it work outside too?

Emily stepped out of the space, pulled out a piece of paper, and concentrated, trying to align her mind with her intention. 

One minute passed... 

Two minutes passed... 

...

Five minutes passed... 

The paper remained still. 

Emily was about to give up, thinking it wouldn’t work outside. Just as she was about to abandon her efforts, the paper suddenly twitched, quickly falling back down. 

Emily squeezed her hands tightly, her hands trembling with excitement. Could she possibly have psychic abilities? 

Wasn't that just like a protagonist from a novel? 

Imagining the day she could effortlessly defeat a swarm of enemies with her mind, Emily burst into laughter. 

Then, from under the paper, Jinbao, her little cat, popped out. Emily's laughter abruptly stopped. Huh??? 

Jinbao??? 

When did he crawl in there???? 

“Jinbao!!!” Emily exclaimed, hands on her hips. 

Jinbao seemed to realize he had done something wrong and scrambled away in a panic. 

Jinbao: I’m just a little cat. I don’t understand anything~

Emily sighed; she was indeed asking for too much. After all, it was already great to be reborn. There was no way something as ethereal as telekinesis could exist. She should stop reading so many novels. 

“Meow!!!” 

Jinbao let out a piercing cry. 

Emily's expression shifted in alarm; unsure of what was happening, she rushed toward the sound echoing from Jinbao. 

Upon reaching the first-floor window, she saw Jinbao with his fur standing on end, arched back, hissing at something outside. 

Looking closer, Emily’s expression turned grave. 

There was a gray wolf in her yard! 

The wolf, perhaps due to the extreme cold, looked thin and had some blood on its fur—the remnants of injuries—and three claw marks on its face that had scabbed over. 

In an aggressive stance, it faced Jinbao, its eyes glowing an eerie green, growling lowly. 

It was definitely considering Jinbao as a meal! 

But Emily had installed soundproof glass; how could it see Jinbao inside? 

She discreetly reached behind her back to retrieve a handgun from her space. 

The gray wolf sensed a new presence by the window and shifted its target, growling at the perceived threat. 

Emily stood calmly, knowing the wolf couldn't enter. As long as she didn't go outside, she was safe. 

Seeing the wolf prepare to attack Emily, Jinbao jumped in front of her instinctively, hissing fiercely, fur bristling. 

Emily felt touched and picked up the fluffball, kissing Jinbao on the forehead, “Oh, I love you, Jinbao! You’re so brave protecting your sister!” 

“Meow~” 

Jinbao still wanted to hiss at the gray wolf, but Emily held him back as she observed the situation outside. 

The wolf, sensing no movement from inside, crouched lower and slowly crept forward. Suddenly, it leaped, jaws open wide, teeth bared, aiming to bite Emily. 

Bang! 

The wolf's head slammed against the glass. 

Shaking its dazed head, it clearly hadn’t expected the window to be so sturdy. 

It attacked again with another loud crash. 

“Bang!” 

The glass held firm, but the wolf's paw must have hurt. 

The gray wolf seemed to hesitate. 

Initially, it had been looking to eat. It had followed the scent of an animal here, only to find that the prey was more formidable than anticipated. 

Yet, through the barrier, the scent of Emily and Jinbao was still enticing. 

Reluctantly, it moved to a corner of the yard, lying down and watching the direction of the villa, intent on waiting for the animals inside to come out. 

Emily could hardly believe how foolish this gray wolf was. She stored the gun back in her space; it looked like she wouldn’t need it just yet. 

However, she had to deal with the wolf. 

She wouldn't allow any threat to her safety to linger so close. 

Carrying Jinbao upstairs, she treated him to a cat treat, then went downstairs to assess the wolf's position. 

Her villa was sealed tight, with no angle to shoot at the wolf. The balcony was already secured, but there was a small staircase leading to a small attic on the second floor that connected to the roof skylight. 

Making her way up, Emily noticed the narrow stairs could only accommodate one person at a time. 

At the top of the staircase, she found a door. Pushing it open, she entered, flipping on the light inside. 

The room was filled with boxes of odds and ends—memories she had stored away. 

Opening one box, she found childhood toys inside. Looking at a teddy bear, Emily felt her eyes swell with tears. 

It had been a long time since she thought of her parents; not because she didn’t want to, but because she simply couldn’t bear it. 

Her earlier life was carefree; her parents were loving, her grandparents pampered her, and she had no worries. But after the plane accident that took her parents, excessive worry had led her grandparents to pass as well, leaving her utterly alone in the world. 

She pushed down her emotions—this wasn't the time for grief. 

Emily grabbed a ladder and nudged the skylight. The window opened just a crack, and a cold breeze swept in, giving her a shiver. 

To avoid alerting the gray wolf outdoors, she gradually pushed it open until it was fully ajar. 

Quietly, she climbed up onto the roof, lying down in the snow, crawling slowly towards where the wolf was. 

The gray wolf perked up its ears and swiftly stood up, looking in the direction of Emily. 

Bang! 

Direct hit! 

“Awooo!” 

The wolf fell to the ground, blood seeping from its forehead, its gaze slowly fading. 

Satisfied with her shot, Emily retreated the gun, smiling. It seemed her marksmanship hadn't deteriorated. She blew on the barrel of the gun before stowing it away again. 

Crawling back the way she came, she went downstairs, stored the gray wolf's body in her space, and then retrieved an off-road vehicle to drive away. 

A body could attract other animals, and if a wolf had come today, who knew what might show up tomorrow? 

It seemed she needed to set up some defenses around the villa as well, she thought. 

After burying the gray wolf, she returned to the villa, hurriedly jumped back into her space to take a shower and change clothes, then dried her hair before coming out. 

Whew! 

So refreshing!
