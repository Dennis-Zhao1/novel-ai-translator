**Title: Sweet Moments Together**

Ji He led a blushing Wendi Wei down the mountain, and not far ahead, they spotted a house.

"Master." Xing Lian emerged from the house, bowing respectfully.

Ji He nodded and continued walking inside with Wendi Wei, while Xing Lian remained outside, calm on the surface, but with surging emotions inside. 

Is this really the Master’s wife? I never imagined I'd get to see this tender side of the otherwise iron-willed Master! Just look at how carefully he treats her! That must be the Tashan flower from the peak that the Master has in her hands! 

It seems the Master had this planned all along, which is why he had me keep an eye on the Tashan flower a while back. Heh heh heh! 

Xing Lian quickly opened his communicator, sending the news to Star Tower.

As Wendi Wei entered the house, she noticed that it was decorated just like her own villa. Confused, she glanced at Ji He, who turned his head away. 

“Oh no! I haven’t told Jiao Jiao that I’m not at the villa!” 

Wendi Wei suddenly remembered that she had left with Ji He without a word, and Jiao Jiao was probably still back at the villa.

Ji He ruffled Wendi Wei's hair and said, “I’ll go back with you.”

Wendi Wei felt a bit shy at that moment, nodding bashfully, “Okay~”

Seeing Wendi Wei acting all coy, Ji He felt a smile emerge in his eyes, thinking how adorable she was. He then took out a spatial button and together with Wendi Wei, they returned to the villa. Upon their return, Wendi Wei looked at the spatial button in amazement.

This thing… is quite impressive~

Ji He playfully pinched Wendi Wei's cheeks and smiled, “Starfall can manage it too.”

Wendi Wei’s eyes widened in surprise, “How come I didn’t know?”

“Master~ I can do so many things!” Starfall said shyly.

Just as Wendi Wei and Ji He arrived at the villa, let’s rewind ten minutes back.

Lin Jiao Jiao felt time had passed for ages. Wendi Wei still hadn’t come out of her room, which made her a bit worried.

*Knock, knock—*

“Wenwen, are you okay?”

Lin Jiao Jiao knocked on Wendi Wei's door, waiting for a few minutes but hearing no response. It seemed odd. Wendi Wei wouldn’t just ignore her like that, even if she was sad.

“Wenwen? I’m coming in now!” 

“I really am coming in!” 

“Wenwen?” 

Lin Jiao Jiao’s voice grew louder, and she finally confirmed that Wendi Wei wasn’t in her room. 

Panic-stricken, Lin Jiao Jiao dashed downstairs. She was sure she hadn’t seen Wendi Wei leave!

How could she just vanish? 

Xu Jin, noticing Lin Jiao Jiao's distress, asked what was going on. When Lin Jiao Jiao mentioned that Wendi Wei was missing, understanding flashed in his eyes. The boss must have used one of those mysterious methods again.

Xu Jin reassured Lin Jiao Jiao that Wendi Wei had probably just stepped out on her own.

Lin Jiao Jiao took a moment to calm her racing heart. Indeed, there wasn't any sign of a struggle in the house.

Just as they were downstairs, Lin Jiao Jiao heard voices coming from upstairs.

That must be Wenwen returning.

Lin Jiao Jiao quickly ran upstairs, halting in her tracks when she saw Wendi Wei and Ji He holding hands.

“You? You two?” 

Lin Jiao Jiao pointed at Wendi Wei and then at Ji He, her expression filled with disbelief. She had sensed a connection between them, but she never thought they would get together today!

Feeling bashful at the sight of Lin Jiao Jiao, Wendi Wei raised her joined hands with Ji He and exclaimed, “Jiao Jiao, we’re together now!”

Lin Jiao Jiao’s expression turned serious as she examined Ji He closely. She stepped forward and took Wendi Wei’s other hand, preparing to walk outside.

Wendi Wei released Ji He's hand and offered him a reassuring look before following Lin Jiao Jiao.

Lin Jiao Jiao brought Wendi Wei to the conference room on the first floor, turning to look at her with a solemn expression, not saying a word.

From the start, Wendi Wei felt calm, but as she was scrutinized, she became increasingly uncomfortable.

“Jiao Jiao, what’s wrong?” 

Wendi Wei turned to pretend to pour water.

Lin Jiao Jiao stepped closer to Wendi Wei and said seriously, “Wenwen, are you sure?”

Realizing what Lin Jiao Jiao meant, Wendi Wei wrapped her arm around Lin Jiao Jiao’s and sat on the sofa, saying, “Jiao Jiao, I’m sure it’s him!”

Lin Jiao Jiao looked at Wendi Wei and sighed, feeling as if her homemade dish had been devoured by a pig.

"As long as you’re sure, just remember to protect yourself no matter the outcome," she advised, gently patting Wendi Wei's head. After all, she was happy at this moment, and if he ever made Wendi Wei unhappy, she would make sure he paid the price.

A cold glimmer flashed in Lin Jiao Jiao's eyes.

Wendi Wei understood that Lin Jiao Jiao was looking out for her, and she nestled closer to Lin Jiao Jiao, jokingly saying, “I know! If he dares to mess with me, I’ll beat him up!” 

She raised her fist playfully as she said this.

“Sigh!” 

Lin Jiao Jiao sighed again, feeling a sense of loss as if her daughter was gone.

Time flew by, and New Year's Eve arrived soon.

Wendi Wei had already prepared the dishes for the night. She didn’t plan on cooking; a feast had already been arranged at the hotel, and now the space was overflowing with it. She planned to cook dumplings by herself tonight.

The dumplings had fillings of pork and scallions, lobster, beef, lamb, and a mixed seafood filling, with fish dumplings for Jin Bao.

First, she crushed the meat fillings using a blender, not too fine, as it would ruin the texture; a bit of graininess in the meat filling makes it taste better. 

She then added cooking wine, oyster sauce, soy sauce, pepper, chicken essence, and salt to the mixture. Now, she needed some help.

Xu Jin and Ji He each took a large bowl and stirred in one direction, following Wendi Wei's instructions.

While they mixed the filling, Wendi Wei started preparing the dough for the dumplings. 

She added cold water to the flour, pouring it in batches until it became a shaggy mass, then kneaded it. At this point, Lin Jiao Jiao took over, as this was a labor-intensive job, best suited for her strength.

After kneading, Wendi Wei rolled the dough into a long strip, sprinkled some flour, and cut it into portions to prevent sticking.

Now it was time to roll out the dumpling wrappers. To her surprise, after she made a few, Xu Jin and Ji He took over and did a good job of it.

Now, just Wendi Wei, Aunt Ji Yu, and Lin Jiao Jiao were sitting together to wrap the dumplings, while Ji He and Xu Jin rolled out the dumpling wrappers.

The warm light illuminated each person’s face, all wearing smiles, creating a harmonious atmosphere. Years later, they would surely reminisce about this beautiful moment.

“Dumplings are ready!” 

With Wendi Wei's enthusiastic announcement, plates suddenly reached out in anticipation.

Wendi Wei chuckled, filling everyone’s plate with dumplings.

The five of them sat at the table together.

“Today, I’ve made some sweet fillings, so whoever gets one will surely have a year filled with sweetness!” Wendi Wei exclaimed, pointing at the dumplings.

“Hmm…." 

Ji He took a bite of a dumpling, looked at it, then at Wendi Wei, and turning the half-eaten dumpling to face everyone proudly declared, “I! Am sweet and sticky!”

His youthful exuberance shone through for everyone to see.

Wendi Wei blushed furiously, while the others teasingly looked at both Wendi Wei and Ji He, having learned in the afternoon that the two were now an item.

Xu Jin whipped out his gossip notebook once again, and Aunt Ji Yu appeared unfazed, as she had long anticipated Ji He's intentions with her little kitty.
