**Title: I Really Like You**

As Wen Ke stood biting into a dumpling, she remembered that the dumplings she had set aside for Jin Bao should be ready now, so she prepared to get up and help.

Ji He pressed her down, rising instead to crumble the dumplings into Jin Bao's bowl as Wen Ke had done earlier.

Lin Jiao raised an eyebrow at Wen Ke, as if to say, "Not bad!"

She had thought this seemingly wealthy young man wouldn't know how to take care of others, but based on his performance tonight, he was doing quite well!

Wen Ke shot her a knowing look in return, as if to say, "How could a man chosen by me be anything less than great?"

After finishing their dumplings, the five of them went to Dreamland Park. Surprisingly, it was bustling with more people than usual, despite Wen Ke expecting it to be relatively empty tonight.

Walking along Ba Hua Square, Wen Ke admired the festive atmosphere at Dreamland Park. The place was filled with families—parents with children and children with parents—each face shining with joy.

They were celebrating life today, cherishing hopes for tomorrow.

Ji He caught up from behind and handed Wen Ke a cup of hot milk tea. It was still warm in her hands, and Wen Ke looked up and smiled sweetly at him.

"Hey, you’re quite good at this!"

Wen Ke had set up self-service kiosks around Dreamland Park that sold everything one could want—just input the name of the item, and it would automatically deduct from the account, allowing visitors to collect their items at the exit.

Due to a sharp decline in population in Huaguo, Wen Ke had partnered with the local government to establish maternity benefits. Pregnant women enjoyed a 25% discount on all services at Dreamland Park.

Initially, the Huaguo representatives intended to cover the discounted amount themselves, but Wen Ke declined, noting that it was a small gesture, and she was happy to contribute. She hoped to witness the vibrancy of life that once existed before the apocalypse—things were still a bit grim now.

Ji He held Wen Ke’s hand, enjoying the softness—a delightful experience for him.

As Wen Ke and Ji He walked ahead, Lin Jiao smiled at the sight of their happiness; for her, seeing Wen Ke content was the best form of joy.

Xu Jin glanced at the couple ahead, a smile forming on his lips. Taishuj Ji Yu noticed the milk tea in Wen Ke's hands and dashed off to buy three cups, handing one each to Lin Jiao, Xu Jin, and herself.

Both Lin Jiao and Xu Jin were surprised to receive milk tea from the usually distant Ji Yu. They hadn't expected her to be so generous!

Ji Yu feigned indifference, maintaining her cool demeanor. "Hmph, that’s because you’re all acknowledged members of our group. Others wouldn’t even get a sip!"

"Wow!" 
"Yes! Let’s have another!"
"Dad, dad, I want to touch it!"

The excited cheers ahead drew the group's attention. They walked over to find a lion dance performance.

This area had been specially opened for the festivities. Even amidst advanced technology, there was something charming about the traditional vibes, so Wen Ke had set up a free street for artisans to showcase their crafts.

The lion dance was performed by a father and son duo, who preserved this inherited craft even after losing the rest of their family to the apocalypse due to the cold. Their physical activity had allowed them to survive.

Upon hearing that Dreamland Park was offering free rentals, they jumped at the chance to continue their lion dance tradition, believing that their skills could bring joy during the festive season.

The child operated the lion's head while the father controlled the tail, following the child's movements with stability. The child's blinking movements delighted the audience.

As the group continued exploring, they were met with dazzling performances—a hot-fire blower, intricate sugar figurines, cute flower-shaped cakes, and exquisite woven crafts.

This street took them back to a time several decades ago when the New Year was full of life. Little did they know, the most vibrant celebrations were happening right now; it’s only through hardship that one learns to cherish joy.

Amidst the crowd, the five of them blended in, red ribbons flying, lucky characters everywhere, riddles, lion dances, and lanterns… The joyous atmosphere revived the essence of the New Year!

Time flew by, and only a few minutes remained until midnight.

Wen Ke and her friends returned to the Dreamland Tower, where visitors below were looking up at the sky in anticipation.

The countdown began in a vibrant red, and everyone joined in synchronizing their voices:
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."

"Happy New Year!" The crowd shouted in unison.

“Biu—bang!” 
Fireworks exploded above, painting the night sky with vibrant colors. Some resembled shooting stars, gliding gracefully downward, while others spread out like celestial flowers, displaying their beauty—some twisting lazily like silver serpents towards the heavens.

The sounds of fireworks merged with firecrackers, creating a thrilling atmosphere that stirred excitement in everyone's hearts while also overwhelming them with joy.

Among the bursts of fireworks and echoes of festive wishes, the year 2076 quietly began.

"Happy New Year." Ji He softly said to Wen Ke as they stood by the floor-to-ceiling window in the Dreamland Tower. He then handed her a space ring.

Wen Ke replied with confusion: "Why are you giving me another space ring?"

As she opened it to take a look, her eyes widened! 

“So many red crystals!”

“It's your New Year's gift,” Ji He stated. He had researched Huaguo culture and understood that during New Year's, it was customary to give "lucky money" or 'hongbao'. People believed that it could ward off evil spirits and ensure peace.

Ji He wanted to wish Wen Ke peace always, so he filled the space ring with all the visible red crystals, leaving the rest for investments that weren’t immediately liquid.

Meanwhile, far away in Central Star, Xing Lian could only sigh... 

Seeing Ji He so earnestly explain his intentions for the gift made Wen Ke find it hard to hold back her amusement. 

“Pfft! You’re so adorable!”

She couldn't help but hug Ji He tightly, burying her face in his chest, trying to suppress her emotional tide, she murmured, “Why are you so nice to me?”

It had been a long time since she last received lucky money—much less such a meaningful amount. To her surprise, Ji He was the one giving it to her this time.

Upon witnessing the quantity of red crystals in the space ring, Wen Ke, having seen the universe, believed she could build a planet with it all. This amount likely represented Ji He’s entire wealth...

Ji He gently patted Wen Ke’s head, sensing her emotional undertones and feeling a bit anxious, he asked, “You don’t like it?”

She seemed so happy every other time why would she not be happy this time?

Wen Ke lifted her head from Ji He’s embrace, tightening her hold on him, declaring, “Who said I didn’t like it? I really, really like it!”

Seeing that Wen Ke’s face didn’t show signs of tears, Ji He hesitated before gently rubbing her head again, speaking softly, “As long as you like it, I’ll keep giving you more in the future.”

Wen Ke’s eyes lit up, and she smiled, “Sure! I really like it!”

“I... really like you!”
