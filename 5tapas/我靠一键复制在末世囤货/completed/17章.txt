**Strange Season of Ji and He**

Winnie looked at Ji He, who was standing at the door. Today, because she was going out, Ji He was wearing a more casual outfit: long pants with a long coat, which he filled out effortlessly due to his height. He exuded a vibe reminiscent of a Korean heartthrob, but with his long black hair cascading lightly behind him, it also evoked the image of a chivalrous hero from ancient China. His sharp, defined features were fixated on her.

Winnie mused to herself, wondering why Ji seemed to have the aura of a snow-clad assassin today…

She wasn't mistaken in her thoughts. Typically, they would have dinner around five or six, but today, she had been so busy that she lost track of time, and now it was already seven or eight.

Ji He hadn’t eaten yet and was feeling a bit irritable. Earlier, he had made a trip to City A to confront Sukou Yu, whom he had just beaten up during their meeting. Far away in City A, Sukou Yu lay in the snow, battered and bruised, staring blankly at the sky.

“Brother, I want to go home…” he mused. If it weren’t for the fact that Lan Xing had hidden the location of the space, he wouldn’t have been stuck on the same planet as that lunatic for so long. Sukou Yu expressed his exhaustion, both physically and mentally.

“Sorry Mr. Ji, I got a bit busy and lost track of time. I’ll start cooking right now!” Winnie said, feeling a bit guilty that she hadn’t prepared dinner yet after taking his things, and quickly dashed off.

Watching Winnie rush into the house, Ji He felt his irritation dissipate, his mood calming gradually. After a brief pause, he stepped inside the villa.

Winnie decided to prepare boiled pork slices, stir-fried beef, and mapo tofu for dinner. Both she and Ji enjoyed spicy food, and she would also make a bowl of chicken soup noodles for Xu Jin separately, using the leftover soup from lunch. She planned to just make noodles as it was the simplest.

First, she sliced the meat thinly, adding an egg white, a spoonful of soy sauce, a spoonful of starch, and a pinch of salt and pepper for marinating. She also added oil to seal in the flavors which would make the meat tender.

While the meat was marinating, she washed the bean sprouts and greens. Winnie preferred mung bean sprouts, so she used those entirely.

Then she prepared a handful of dried chilies, cutting them into small pieces, and heated some Sichuan peppercorns in oil until fragrant. Once the oil was hot, she added the doubanjiang (broad bean paste) and hot pot base to cook until the oil turned red, and then added the chopped scallions, ginger, and garlic.

At this point, she poured in some water, boiling it, and added the greens and bean sprouts to blanch them before draining them and placing them at the bottom of the bowl. Next, she added the marinated meat slices to the pot until cooked, pouring the broth over it as well.

On top of this, she sprinkled a generous handful of dried chilies, chili powder, and Sichuan pepper before drizzling hot oil and adding a few coriander sprigs. And just like that, it was done!

Winnie placed the cooked boiled pork slices into an insulated box and began preparing for the next dish, stir-fried beef.

Using the leftover ingredients from the boiled pork, she added some small, spicy chilies and diced pickled peppers. She sliced the beef and marinated it with two spoons of soy sauce, a spoonful of oyster sauce, a pinch of salt, a spoonful of starch, and two spoons of cooking oil.

While the beef marinated, Winnie took out another pot to blanch the tofu cubes with a bit of salt for flavor.

Next, she heated oil in a pan, adding coriander, small chilies, pickled peppers, and garlic, then seasoned it with a spoonful of soy sauce and oyster sauce. At this point, she added the marinated beef directly into the pan, stirring it evenly. A splash of pickled pepper liquid for flavor, then it was done and sent into the insulated box.

The tofu was ready now, so she heated oil in the pan, adding the prepped ground meat, frying until it changed color, followed by the dried chilies and Sichuan pepper and a spoonful of doubanjiang to cook and release the red oil.

Once this was done, she added the blanched tofu gently, stirring carefully, then added a spoonful of soy sauce, a small half spoon of dark soy sauce, half a spoonful of sugar, and a bit of starch water, letting it simmer until the sauce thickened. She topped it with scallions before serving!

The chicken soup noodles for Xu Jin were also ready. Winnie carried the dishes upstairs to the dining table, noticing that Ji He was already seated.

Winnie went downstairs to call Xu Jin up. Earlier that afternoon, he had borrowed a razor and scissors from her to tidy up his hair and beard.

Now sporting a buzz cut, Xu Jin looked sharper than before, with a stylish and somewhat rogue appeal in the black long padded coat she had prepared for him, complete with a hood.

As Xu Jin climbed up, he immediately caught sight of Ji He seated at the table. It was the first time he’d seen him since waking up.

He was taken aback by the sight. Ji He’s black coat accentuated his snow-white skin, his exquisite features framed by long black hair, radiating a powerful presence that was impossible to overlook. There was something both mysterious and dangerous about him, like a king among shadows, standing tall above others.

Winnie introduced, “This is Ji He, Mr. Ji.”

Xu Jin quickly greeted him, “Hello, Mr. Ji, I’m Xu Jin.” He felt a shiver run through him; Winnie really kept her cards close to the vest. This man was clearly no simple person.

Ji He glanced at Xu Jin, feeling an inexplicable displeasure wash over him. Instead of returning Xu Jin’s greeting, he turned to Winnie and asked, “Is it time to eat?”

Winnie laughed to ease the mood. “Mr. Ji isn’t much of a talker and can be a bit socially anxious, so don’t take it personally.”

Xu Jin quickly waved his hands, “Not at all! Not at all!” 

Of course not; he wouldn’t dare take offense!

The three of them sat down to eat. Ji He finished his meal quickly and headed downstairs immediately. Winnie felt a bit puzzled, as Ji usually would eat until there was nothing left.

But she quickly shrugged it off, thinking perhaps Ji was just in a bad mood…

The next morning, Winnie took the breakfast she had bought before the end of the world and placed it in the insulated box. After informing Ji He and Xu Jin, she headed straight to the supermarket to install the glass.

This small community supermarket had two levels: the first floor was for groceries—snacks, drinks, rice, oil, and so forth—while the second floor had everyday items for women, such as sanitary pads, towels, clothes, and pants. 

Each floor probably had about 200 square meters, and the layout was already organized. Perhaps the previous owner of the supermarket was quite wealthy; the renovations were decent.

To her surprise, the supermarket had suffered minimal damage, with only some dirt around the windows.

Winnie called Xiao Ai over to continue inputting cleaning commands while she went back to install the glass. 

Since she had done well the day before, she managed to install all the glass within an hour.

Xiao Ai also finished cleaning, and once she saw the tidy supermarket, Winnie nodded in satisfaction. She decided not to change the arrangement of the items inside and just needed to lay down some underfloor heating.

After giving Xiao Ai commands to install the heating, she was pleasantly surprised when Xiao Ai responded, “Command received!”

Winnie felt delighted; Xiao Ai could do it!

Confidently leaving the underfloor heating task to Xiao Ai, Winnie headed over to the library side, retrieving the books and shelves from before the end of the world and arranging them as they were before.

On the sixth floor, she set aside a small room. For some unknown reason, she had a feeling there might be more books to find. So, she made a deliberate choice to leave space for them.
