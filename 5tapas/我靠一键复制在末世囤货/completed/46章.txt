**Toast to Our Youth**

As night fell, the news of the incident involving the woman spread throughout the neighborhood, reaching even those at the military district. 

"Hey, did you hear? Miss Wen said that woman won't be able to go out again!" a female student exclaimed to a male classmate who had just finished digging for magma stone.

The boy shook his head, just returning and unaware of what had happened. 

The girl, excited that he was oblivious, quickly launched into the story: "Let me tell you what happened today..."

Wen Keke, overhearing the live coverage of the gossip, felt her mouth twitch. The events from earlier in the day had become the talk of the town— 

"Hey, did you hear?"

"Wow, Miss Wen was really something today!"

"What happened? Why didn't I know? Someone fill me in!"

Wen Keke decided not to interfere; after all, this was beneficial for her. With everyone distracted by the gossip, they were less likely to stir up trouble around her. She was curious, though, about how they knew what had happened so quickly when she had only learned about the woman's ban on going out that afternoon from Lin Jiao.

Indeed, gossip was a human trait, especially among people in Huaguo!

Wen Keke shook her head and continued preparing for tonight’s barbecue party, wanting to set the right atmosphere. She brought out a portable house from the Huiyue Star System—a treasure she hadn’t cared much for initially but later realized had a spacious yard, green grass, swings, and tall trees.

She placed it near a grove. In the middle of the grass, she set up a large barbecue grill, with a smaller one nearby for grilling the chicken Lin Jiao had brought. Under a tree, she laid out a big table with a cloth and utensils. The tree was adorned with lights that illuminated the table, and the house had a protective layer that kept the temperature around twenty-five degrees Celsius.

As Wen Keke threaded meat onto skewers, she used deer meat from Sister Ji and wild boar meat gifted by Ji He. There was a heap of beef, lamb, chicken feet, and other barbecue favorites prepared as well. She also stocked up on vegetables like potatoes, tofu skin, mushrooms, and eggplants.

To balance out the heaviness of the barbecue, she tossed together some cold dishes.

Despite her own yard being destroyed by the extreme cold—now just a barren landscape—this house from Huiyue had a self-cleaning feature that meant no mess or smell would be left behind.

When Lin Jiao first saw the portable house, she was astounded. Though she had just learned that Wen Keke’s uncle was a great scientist, she had never seen something so magical. A ball that could fit in the palm of one’s hand transformed into an entire house, complete with trees, grass, and even butterflies! Wen Keke explained that although the greenery was fake, it felt refreshingly real to Lin Jiao, who hadn’t encountered it in a long time.

Taishu Ji Yu and Ji He, along with Xu Jin, learned about Wen Keke’s barbecue party. Xu Jin volunteered to handle the drinks, having dabbled in bartending, although both Ji Yu and Ji He forbade any alcohol. He even placed a sign on the drink table that read:

*“Ms. Ji and Mr. Ji He strictly prohibit alcohol consumption!”*

Taishu Ji Yu snorted, unimpressed, “As if anyone would sneak drinks.”

Of course, she disregarded the few bottles she had secretly tucked away in her space bracelet.

Bored, Taishu Ji Yu surveyed the area for unoccupied tasks and decided to sit down. Suddenly, she recalled the good stuff in her space bracelet. She rummaged around, eventually pulling out a sizable speaker and turning it on.

“Darling, a ha, you will not get hurt…”
 
The booming sound startled Wen Keke, who rushed over to where the noise was coming from. She found her sister Ji Yu lounging in a chair, lost in the enjoyment of music blasting from the massive speaker.

The speaker was about her height, and if it weren’t for the house’s soundproofing, the entire neighborhood would have probably been disturbed by the noise late at night.

Wen Keke quickly set down the meat skewers she was preparing and hurried over, covering her ears to lower the volume. "Sister Ji, how did you get this out?"

She rubbed her ears, which had become sensitive after some recent enhancements to her physical abilities. The loud sound resonated painfully.

Taishu Ji Yu straightened up, puzzled as she looked at Wen Keke. “The supermarket had a slogan about entertainment tools. Isn’t that exactly what we need now? I think the song is catchy!”

She had never heard songs like that in the Ailan star system; the unique tune had a captivating allure that won her over after just a few listens.

Wen Keke connected her tablet to the speaker via Bluetooth and selected a suitable track for Taishu Ji Yu, hoping to help her refine her taste in music. Such an elegant beauty shouldn't be stuck listening to the odd music she found delightful.

The music flowed from the speaker at a pleasant volume:

*“I wanna follow where she goes,
I think about her and she knows it...”*

The unique melody echoed through the yard, offering a sense of freedom.

Under the shimmering moonlight, five people, bound not by blood but by friendship, exchanged smiles and raised their glasses together.

*Here’s a toast to our youth!*
