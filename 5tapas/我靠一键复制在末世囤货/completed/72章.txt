**A Remarkable Skill Acquired**

“General Wei, what secret conversation were you having with Miss Wen? Care to share it with me?” 

At that moment, Sun Zhi approached with a curious look on his face. He had been watching from a distance, initially hesitant to join due to the serious atmosphere. Now that things seemed lighter, he stepped in to ease the mood. After all, one was a leader he respected, despite his bluntness and staunch patriotism, and the other was someone crucial to the pivotal Dawn Base. If the two quarreled, it could create a rift in the base, and they absolutely couldn’t afford any mistakes.

“Go away, go away, you're everywhere,” General Wei waved his hand dismissively at Sun Zhi with an annoyed expression.

“Hey, hey, hey, General! You’ve finished your food, so come on, try some of these freshly grilled skewers. I made them myself!” Sun Zhi said with a cheeky grin while handing the skewers over to General Wei.

General Wei frowned slightly, “What nonsense is this? Be serious.” 

Though his words were stern, his hands were quick to grab all the skewers from Sun Zhi’s hands.

“Cough, cough, cough! You’re still young; you shouldn’t eat this junk food all the time,” Wen Keke murmured while watching the warm exchange before sneaking away.

On the deck.

“Ah He, why have you been staring at me this whole time?” 

Wen Keke leaned against the railing and turned to ask, noticing Ji He watching her silently. 

Ji He’s gaze was intense as he looked at Wen Keke, “You just kissed me.” 

Wen Keke’s eyes widened in realization, “Oh, you mean that? Don’t you like it?” 

She tilted her head with a bright smile, finding Ji He adorable in his current state. 

Ji He studied the girl in front of him, her eyes crinkling from laughter, and the mischievous glint in her delicate face told him she was teasing him. He raised an eyebrow and leaned closer, gripping the railing behind her.

Wen Keke found herself encircled in Ji He’s arms, but she didn’t push him away. Instead, she smiled up at him.

Ji He bent down slightly, inching his face closer to hers as the gentle evening breeze tangled their hair together, their eyes reflecting one another.

As the distance closed, the warmth of their breaths brushed against each other, confirming Wen Keke’s realization—Ji He was indeed leaning in for a kiss.

Wen Keke’s eyes widened in shock, and Ji He, with a playful smile in his eyes, tightened his arms around her waist slightly, drawing her closer.

“I like it,” he whispered. 

Feeling her face heat up, Wen Keke playfully pinched his waist, only for Ji He to maintain his composure.

After a long moment, tears began to brim in Wen Keke's eyes, causing Ji He to panic and quickly release her:

“I’m sorry! I made a mistake!” 

His delicate face turned pale with genuine concern as he looked at her. 

Wen Keke burst out laughing, pressing her hands on her stomach, “Pfft! Hahaha, I can’t help it! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to!”

Ji He looked bewildered as he watched Wen Keke laugh, his expression shifting from confusion to utter perplexity. 

“What just happened?” 

After a fit of laughter, Wen Keke finally straightened herself, wiping away tears of amusement. Spotting Ji He’s confused face brought on another wave of giggles. 

“Cough, cough, have you never kissed anyone before?” 

Who kisses and just keeps their lips pressed together without moving for so long?

With that thought, she couldn’t help but chuckle again.

“Nope, why?” Ji He replied, maintaining an air of feigned calmness, though the flush in his ears revealed his embarrassment.

He wondered if he did something wrong. But according to the dramas he’d watched, the male lead would pull the female lead close and kiss her, even if she struggled initially, she’d end up blushing and melting in his embrace! He followed all the steps correctly!

Wen Keke noticed Ji He’s blush and didn’t plan to expose him, “It’s nothing; I’ll teach you.” 

With that, she wrapped her arms around Ji He’s neck, drawing him down towards her, leaning in…

After a long while, Ji He finally opened his eyes, looking at Wen Keke with a curious expression as he touched his moist lips—so that’s how it was…

It was as if he had just unlocked a remarkable skill.

In stark contrast to the sweet atmosphere on the deck, inside the D City Military Base.

“Report, General! Supplies are on their way from headquarters and will arrive the day after tomorrow!” 

A young man dressed in tattered clothing, which vaguely resembled a military uniform, reported to the man in front of him.

“Great, pass the word around! Tell everyone to hang on for two more days; there will be food coming!” 

The young man replied to Lin Xiongan, the highest commander of D City, who, despite wearing neat black attire, showed signs of neglect with dirt smudges all over.

Lin Xiongan prepared to rise and hold a meeting, but as soon as he stood, his legs buckled, and he had to sit back down.

“General!” 

The young man rushed over to support Lin Xiongan as he stumbled.

“I’m fine. You need to hurry and spread the word to reassure everyone,” Lin Xiongan gestured with his hand.

The young man hesitated, wanting to stay, but understanding the urgency of the situation, he eventually exited.

“Yes, sir!”

Lin Xiongan sat on the chair, his square face filled with relief. They were finally getting help, finally! 

If General Wei were to see Lin Xiongan in this state now, he would be surprised; the once robust Lin Xiongan had become a gaunt figure. How did it come to this?
