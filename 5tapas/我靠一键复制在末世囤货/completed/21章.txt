**The Taishu Family**

"Information entry is complete! Welcome to your new residence, Miss Ji!" 

A sly grin blossomed on Wen Keke's face, her excitement bubbling over.

Taishu Jiyu gazed at Wen Keke, her eyes shimmering, and playfully asked, "Don't you require rent?"

She couldn’t help but worry about this little cat of a family… Can just anyone move in?

It seems she would need to teach the little cat a thing or two about being cautious.

Wen Keke tilted her head, raising an eyebrow, "Others need to pay, but beauties like you, Miss Ji, receive special treatment~"

She then pulled out a large blackboard from the cabinet, upon which was written:

**[Accommodation Conditions]**
1. Exchange goods for stay—The greater the value of the goods you offer, the longer your stay. The value assessment will be determined by the owner.
2. Exchange labor for stay—Use your skills to earn accommodation time (e.g., cooking, etc.…).
3. Lava stones (extracted from within volcanoes, tools can be borrowed from the owner), various ores, and metal resources can also be exchanged for accommodation—One lava stone is worth ten days, others will be assessed by the owner for exchange.
4. Everything is subject to the owner's mood.
5. All conditions above are fully at the owner's discretion.

All the conditions were devised by Wen Keke herself, except for the third one. This was because the Interstellar Detection had detected ample lava stones beneath Blue Star, a resource scarce in the galaxy.

The energy contained in these stones was crucial for building spaceships.

While the other resources might not hold as much importance compared to lava stones, they still mattered in the interstellar context and could be used as currency.

Knowing Wen Keke would be heading to the interstellar realm, the detection system had informed her of the importance of these resources early on, urging her to stockpile them.

Moreover, Wen Keke's drive to run an inn wasn't solely due to resource management; she also wanted to draw her nation's attention, establish connections, and provide humanity with a larger space to survive.

Taishu Jiyu looked at the conditions on the board, particularly the last one, and couldn’t help but laugh softly, "Owner Wen~ you are truly adorable~ But since these are conditions, I can’t break them. Here, keep this safe, okay? Little cat~"

Taishu Jiyu retrieved a blue gem from her spatial bracelet and handed it to Wen Keke.

Upon seeing the blue gem, Wen Keke felt an inexplicable urge to draw closer; it was warm, comforting, akin to enjoying a cool breeze on a summer day while eating watermelon.

Wen Keke took the stone, puzzled, and asked, "What is this...?"

Taishu Jiyu playfully pinched Wen Keke's cheek and replied, "This is a Serenity Stone. It can help you maintain calmness and balance your emotions."

Of course, it served more purposes than just that; for the Taishu family, this stone was a lifesaver.

In the Eilan galaxy, due to genetic issues over the past few centuries, humans were born with defects in their mental abilities, and the population began to decline, making it increasingly difficult to bear offspring. This was why Taishu Jiyu personally came to seek the bloodline of the Taishu family.

To change this phenomenon, the Council had invented gene enhancers. While these enhancers could improve birth rates slightly, the total population still saw a gradual decline.

Moreover, the enhancers increased physical strength, allowing the previously reliant interstellar citizens to bolster their chances of survival, which is why more families chose to implement them from birth onwards.

The Taishu family was royal because only they possessed complete mental abilities, though even their mental capabilities had waned over time, leading interstellar citizens to put more faith in the Council.

Another unique group, the Oracle Institute, also possessed mental powers, but they stayed out of conflicts.

Currently, there was fierce contention between the pro-Taishu faction, relying on their mental abilities, and the Council, who rallied support around the gene enhancers.

The search for Mang's bloodline was due to it being the perfect gene, symbolizing perfect mental capacity, and only the Mang bloodline could be perfectly replicated.

Finding this bloodline meant the potential to create a serum to rectify the mental defects of the interstellar peoples, which was crucial for the Taishu family.

Conversely, the Council sought to eradicate it, as it posed a significant obstacle to their ambitions.

The Serenity Stone also provided a mental energy supply for users. After all, Taishu family members, in comparison to their genetically enhanced counterparts, found their physical strength relatively weak. Exhausting their mental powers could leave them vulnerable.

Thus, this stone became a lifeline—ensuring that when their mental resources were depleted, they would still receive ongoing support in life-threatening situations.

Over time, Serenity Stones became incredibly scarce, available mainly in ancient families like the Taishu, while perhaps some could also be found in the Oracle Institute.

Taishu Jiyu gave this stone to Wen Keke to ensure her protection as a member of the Taishu family.

Wen Keke nodded, understanding, and grinned, "Hehe, alright then, Miss Ji, I've got your room ready for you! It's in Building A, Room 201. Let me take you there!"

Wen Keke divided all the buildings from the supermarket into ten sections, labeled A to J, each containing two rooms on every floor and twenty-six floors in total.

The room assigned to Taishu Jiyu in Building A, Room 201, was closest to the supermarket.

After settling Taishu Jiyu, Wen Keke returned to the villa and summoned the detection system to analyze the blue gem.

"Analysis in progress! Beep! Analysis complete!"

The detection system relayed the peaceful and supplying properties of the Serenity Stone.

Wen Keke expressed her surprise, "So, mental powers really exist?"

The detection system obediently responded, "Yes, Master, but currently, only the Taishu family and the Oracle Institute utilize mental powers in the Eilan galaxy."

Wen Keke followed up, "Then why do I feel so comfortable with this stone, like I’m being nourished?"

"Perhaps the Serenity Stone is calming the host’s emotions."

Wen Keke suspected that must be the case, having previously experimented with mental powers to her regret… cough, cough…

Meanwhile, in a small grove, Taishu Jiyu faced off against her counterpart, Ji He.

If one could disregard the tension between them, the scene would have been quite picturesque.

Taishu Jiyu broke the silence first, "You should be aware of the current situation. The Council's Third Elder, Sijiu Yu, is already on Blue Star."

Ji He, with his hands in his pockets and casually chewing a strawberry-flavored candy, replied blandly, "So what?"

"So, Mang's bloodline must not fall into their hands. You also know what happened to the last Mang bloodline; I believe you wouldn't stand by given your relationship with that individual."

Taishu Jiyu’s gaze was steady, a smile playing on her lips.

"Crack—"

The sound of crushed candy echoed in the air.

Ji He turned his eyes toward Taishu Jiyu, a fierce look brewing within, "Are you investigating me?"

Wind began to swirl around them, freezing snowflakes mid-air, while the snow on the ground slowly lifted to form a snowstorm centered around Ji He.

Taishu Jiyu, simultaneously preparing for defense, said, "Just some news from the Oracle Institute. What are you doing here beside my little cat?"

She couldn’t allow this madman to linger near her charge.

Ji He’s expression flickered with surprise, Taishu family?

The fury in his eyes gradually faded, the wind calming as the airborne snowflakes resumed their descent.

"The Taishu family? You mean Wen Keke?"

Taishu Jiyu's tension eased, and she looked back at Ji He, "Yes, she is a bloodline of my Taishu family. May I ask what your intentions are here?"

Ji He didn’t respond, instead pulling out another grape-flavored candy from his pocket.

"You don’t know she is the Mang bloodline?" 

"What?"
