Title: The Rising Tide

It turned out to be such a ridiculous reason.  
The man driving the car sped fiercely all the way to the entrance of the base, and it was unclear what credentials he showed, but he passed through without obstruction and parked directly in front of a white building.  
Katherine Wen had been to the Dawn Base before and knew that it housed the research facilities.  
The researcher in a lab coat, Han Huo, got out of the car without bothering about Katherine in the back seat. He likely thought that since she was already at the base, there would be no danger.  
However, he locked the car door!  
Katherine felt a bit speechless; but with the data collection device, Starfall, present, there wouldn’t be any problems if any data needed collecting.  
Han Huo swiftly walked toward Dr. Gao's research lab.  
When he reached the door, Han Huo took a few deep breaths and knocked on the door.  
“Knock, knock—”  
“Come in.”  
Dr. Gao's voice came from inside. Han Huo opened the door and stepped in, approaching Dr. Gao with an anxious expression, saying,  
“Doctor, the flood is nearly here! The detector shows it will reach Qi Ju Mountain in two hours.”  
Dr. Gao didn't even furrow his brow upon hearing Han Huo's words. He continued his research and calmly replied,  
“Why are you panicking? It won’t flood this place, and we’re all at the base. What are you afraid of?”  
Han Huo paused, realizing Qi Ju Mountain had been determined through repeated tests to be a safe area, equipped with flood barriers, plus Dr. Gao had so many technological products at his disposal. Why was he so scared?  
It must be the deep impression left by his first exposure to extreme cold…  
Han Huo's heart gradually calmed down but suddenly recalled that there was still a girl in his car. Surely he hadn’t locked the door, right...?  
Han Huo hurriedly dashed back outside. Dr. Gao shook his head at Han Huo's retreating figure, recognizing him as just another youthful individual—so easily flustered.  
He then took out his communication device and sent a message to Yuanshan Wang at the government building.  
【The flood period has arrived.】  
Yuanshan Wang, who was working in his office, frowned slightly at the message, but soon relaxed.  
“So what if it’s here? We’re prepared.”  
At that moment, Katherine Wen, whom Han Huo was concerned about, had already arrived at the government building of the Dawn Base.  
Though it was an eight-day project, the Dawn Base appeared to embody the feel of a big city from the outside.  
In front of the government building were several dozen steps leading up to the entrance, adorned with large national flags.  
Jiaojiao Lin was already waiting on the first floor for Katherine. She was surprised to receive a message earlier from Katherine saying she had reached the Dawn Base.  
“Katherine, why did you come to the base? What happened? The higher-ups are upstairs; I’ll take you to see them.”  
She knew Katherine wouldn’t just drop by without a reason.  
“Jiaojiao, the flood period has been moved up.”  
Katherine followed Jiaojiao up the stairs while explaining.  
Jiaojiao's cool demeanor momentarily showed shock, but she quickly regained her composure, realizing this was serious, and didn’t say more, hastening her steps.  
“Knock, knock—”  
“What’s with the knocking? Can’t you see what time it is?!”  
Katherine instantly recognized the voice of General Wang Youguo from inside.  
The door opened, and upon seeing Katherine and Jiaojiao, Wang Youguo quickly ushered them in to sit down.  
Looking around, Katherine noted the presence of the leader of Huaguo, General Wei, and others, including Sun Zhi from earlier. Katherine occupied a chair nearby.  
Seeing Katherine seated, Wang Yougan smiled warmly and said,  
“Are you here regarding the flood?”  
Katherine nodded, “I’m curious about the government's preparations for this flood.”  
Wang Yougan took a sip of water, leaning back slightly as he sighed,  
“We are well-prepared on both personnel and resources. Miss Wen, your presence here must be for more than just to inquire about our readiness, right?”  
Katherine smiled, “Perhaps I have a few other questions? I wonder if Uncle Wang would share some insights with me.”  
Wang Yougan, looking to be in his early fifties, found it fitting for Katherine to call him uncle.  
Her calling him Uncle Wang brought him some comfort. Zhao Jinshu had always been difficult, yet his daughter seemed quite sweet, making him laugh heartily. “Then I’ll just call you niece; feel free to ask whatever you want.”  
Katherine continued, “Then I’ll ask, Uncle, do you know the reason for the apocalypse?”  
Given the seemingly normal circumstances, she had assumed it was just natural changes on Earth. However, the premature end of the extreme cold and the early arrival of the flood period suggested that Huaguo seemed to have foresight about what was to come.  
Moreover, most of the supplies they had previously purchased could address the impending flooding.  
This made her suspicious; did Huaguo know something?  
Wang Yougan sighed,  
“You see, we only found out about the apocalypse in August.”  
He went on to explain how the collaboration between the Zhao family and the foreign alien race known as the Kousi led to the apocalypse’s onset. There was no reason to hide such information from Katherine, who belonged to the alien faction.  
As Katherine listened, she fell progressively silent.  
So…  
Her death in her previous life was merely a consequence of their so-called interests…  
Anger arose within her. How ridiculous—this group of self-proclaimed high-level beings from elsewhere had destroyed the lives on an entire planet for the sake of resources. Gone was her usual cheerful demeanor, replaced by a cold aura.  
Wang Yougan thought her fury was due to some other discoveries she had made, unaware that she had already lived and died once—more than aware that her previous demise was at the hands of human designs fueled by greed.  
“Chief, I will go inform everyone below to prepare for the flood,” Jiaojiao quickly spoke, noticing Katherine was upset.  
Wang Yougan recognized Katherine’s bad mood and waved his hand dismissively, saying,  
“Dear niece, you should hurry home; the flood is nearing. I suspect your place is safer.”  
He didn’t dare keep Katherine here; he knew how much Wen Jinshu valued his daughter’s safety and that she must have prepared everything at home. It was certainly far more secure than staying at the base.  
Katherine sensed there was no point in lingering. She stood and agreed,  
“Then I’ll head back now.”  
On the way out, Jiaojiao gazed worriedly at Katherine and touched her head, asking,  
“Katherine, what’s wrong?”  
Katherine was aware of Jiaojiao's concern but couldn’t reveal her death-and-rebirth ordeal. Though aliens were now out in the open, the idea of coming back was still frightening.  
She suppressed her anger deep within, knowing it would not change anything now, and forced a smile, saying,  
“I’m just a bit upset knowing the world became like this because of those people’s interests.”  
Katherine even gestured slightly with her fingers to illustrate “a little bit.”  
Jiaojiao gave Katherine’s head a gentle rub, saying,  
“If you don't want to smile, don’t force it. I’ll always be by your side. Now hurry back; the flood is coming.”  
Katherine nodded earnestly, her eyes brimming with tears. Jiaojiao truly was still the same Jiaojiao: “Mm!”
