**Trading with the Republic of Huaguo**

Across from her, David Wang looked at Keke Wen's somewhat awkward expression and smiled. "Keke, your high-tech ideas are just as quirky as your father's, haha!"

Curious, Keke asked, "I heard from Jiajia that you know my father?"

David Wang leaned back in his chair, his gaze distant. "Your father... he’s the greatest scientist in the Republic of Huaguo. You might not know, right?"

Seeing Keke's surprised expression, he grinned playfully. "It's not surprising you don't know. After all, your father appears to be just a businessman on the surface. However, he has been secretly providing us with interstellar technology all this time. By now, you must have heard some stories about planets beyond our Blue Star, right?"

Keke nodded, and David continued. "Your parents came from beyond Blue Star. They set foot on our planet over twenty years ago. When your father arrived, he immediately struck a deal with us, offering interstellar technology in exchange for keeping his identity secret and ensuring no other country disturbs him. For the past twenty years, he has been teaching us technology. Dr. Gao from the S City Research Institute is one of your father's students. Without your father, the losses we would have suffered would be magnified several times. So, your father is truly remarkable; his technological contributions have ensured our survival in these desperate times."

As David spoke, Keke found herself in a daze—her father hailed from beyond Blue Star... What about her mother? And her grandparents?

She thought these questions but hesitated to voice them. David Wang, noticing her puzzlement, shook his head apologetically. "I'm afraid I don't know the answers to your questions. Our agreement stipulates that we cannot disturb him or his family."

Keke began to understand; it was no wonder her father was hardly at home, and her mother was usually busy too.

Wanting to change the subject, Keke looked at David Wang and said, "I know why you're here. The Qi Mountain base wasn't mine to begin with. If you want to build a base, you can. I can trade with you, providing everything you need in exchange for magma stones."

After earning some magma stones from the students at S University recently, Keke had come to appreciate their value. The items crafted from magma stones proved far superior compared to those made with the dismantled materials with 'Little Ai.' The Starfall said it could produce a starship if they collected more magma stones, which intrigued Keke’s curiosity to see such a starship. Thus, her desire for magma stones only grew.

The representatives from Huaguo were already aware of what magma stones were and agreed to Keke's request.

Keke retrieved a contract from her spatial storage and offered it to them. It was always safer to have a written agreement.

David Wang glanced over the terms and exclaimed, "A hundred magma stones for a hundred pieces of clothing? Can't that be a little cheaper? This one—fifty magma stones for fifty pounds of meat—seems acceptable... but ten magma stones for ten pounds of water? Isn’t that excessive? Water's abundant outside!”

"That's the only price I can offer." Keke smiled, unwavering in her negotiation.

No one could dampen her excitement to see a spaceship.

Astonished, David Wang's eyes lit up as he watched Keke produce the contract. "Miss Wen, is this the legendary spatial storage? I wonder if that could be part of our trade?”

After pondering for a moment, Keke retrieved a replica of 'Little Ai,' and brought out a vial of each potion she possessed, along with various weapons that Starfall crafted for her playful use.

She had previously confirmed with Ji He that she could exchange these potions with Huaguo.

David Wang’s eyes grew wider looking at the increasing array of items on the table, momentarily forgetting his initial interest in her spatial storage, while Colonel Wang who had been vocally skeptical was now rendered speechless.

Seeing the assortment of items Keke casually displayed, it was evident there was no need to squeeze them at all.

General Wei behind them looked astounded, while Lin Jiajia threw a worried glance at Keke, concerned that her displaying such items might attract unwanted attention.

Keke pointed at each item, explaining, "This is a housework robot; despite the name, it can complete all standard commands and has attack settings. 

- Green Potion: Repair Potion, can instantly restore 80% of physical injuries.
- Yellow Potion: Adaptation Potion, allows for permanent acclimatization to any temperature. 
- Red Potion: Activation Potion, maximizes body potential by ten times.
- Purple Potion: Dizziness Potion, when sprayed in the air, can incapacitate a target for three minutes.
- Blue Potion: Used alongside the Dizziness Potion, negates its effects upon consumption (lasts for five minutes). 

This is a laser cannon; it doesn't require extra ammunition and can fire continuously, with a range of 500 meters."

She refrained from producing the transparent replication potion and the golden alchemical potion as they were either difficult to replicate in her space or simply out of her own selfish desire.

Then she thought of something else and added, "I also have all construction materials and vehicles, would you like any of that?"

David Wang tapped his fingers on the table with a chuckle. "Miss Wen, those items must come at a high price, right?"

Keke’s eyes sparkled as she narrowed her smile, "Not at all! How about I give you a discount: twenty thousand magma stones for each weapon, fifteen thousand magma stones for a potion, and a thousand grams of other materials for a hundred magma stones. What do you think?"

"Let’s start with ten thousand housework robots!" David Wang recognized that Keke had not overreached with her pricing and immediately agreed, signing the deal on the spot.

They settled the location of the base, which will be established at the back of Qi Mountain. The front side was where Keke lived, and the backyard could be accessed through a small forest road. The location would connect to a broad plain, which was mostly safe from floods due to the flood control embankment Keke had set up.

After establishing the base site, David contemplated for a moment and suggested, "We currently don’t have any magma stones and would require manpower and resources for mining. I noticed you have mining machines, would you be able to lend us some? After all, this is in line with our cooperation.”

Keke deliberated; lending them was possible, but... "How many magma stones are you willing to offer for that?"

"Isn't it reasonable to factor that cost into the earlier agreements? Oh, too bad we just signed!" David Wang feigned surprise at Keke’s inquiry.

Keke's mouth twitched; he was trying to get a free ride. What a blunder on her part.

Forget it; if they want to borrow without payment, she would treat it as her contribution to the country!

After both parties signed, Keke chatted a bit more, discussing the impending flood risks, and expressed hope that the base would be completed within a fortnight, given that robots would expedite the process significantly.

David Wang grasped the urgency and hurried back to the military base to gather personnel for the upcoming project.

Meanwhile, Keke slouched in her chair and asked Ji He, "Do you know him?"

Ji He nodded. "I've done business with him before."

Keke pondered, why did everyone seem to have dealings with David Wang?
