Chapter: The Memories You Thought You Lost

Especially fond of sweet and spicy foods! 
Thinking of her sister Ji, who also loves sweets, it becomes apparent that since the supermarket installed a milk tea machine, she's hardly been without her cup, often having three a day.

Wen Keke decided to make some desserts for them tomorrow. 
Oh, right! What about Jinbao? 
During this time, Jinbao had only been eating cat food. She thought it would be nice to cook a special meal for him!

As if sensing that Wen Keke was thinking of him, Jinbao raced to the doorway, his tail swaying leisurely behind him, and his striking blue eyes fixated on Wen Keke. 
“Meow~” 
He had in his mouth a recent favorite—a plush little dinosaur.

Wen Keke had discovered this toy in her space’s play area and found it amusing, so she brought it out. To her surprise, Jinbao adored it and carried it everywhere. 
Wen Keke patted the empty space on the bed and called out, “Jinbao~ Come sleep with me!” 

Jinbao gracefully jumped onto the bed, settled down where she had patted, and made sure to lay the little dinosaur beside him as a pillow.

Feeling satisfied, Wen Keke cuddled Jinbao and drifted off to sleep.

The next day, Wen Keke woke up naturally, and after breakfast, she noticed that the entire neighborhood was quite different. Oh, right—she thought the name "Inn" sounded a bit odd, so now it was renamed to "Warm Community."

Principal Li secretly felt pleased, knowing he had hinted to Wen Keke that the name “Inn” was not quite appropriate—inns feel like transient places, while "community" conveys a sense of home.

Hugh Qingyun watched with a sidelong glance.

Wen Keke found that all the residents had vanished, and when she asked Xu Jin, who was petting Jinbao nearby, she learned they were all in the supermarket. 
Xu Jin suggested, “I think we could set up a car rental service. A few people came over just now asking if they could rent that interstellar bus we drove yesterday; they want to head into the city to gather resources to exchange for points.”

Wen Keke thought this was a great idea. 
However, considering the size of her community, she felt it was a bit small. Initially, she had thought her community was spacious enough with ten buildings, but after five hundred people suddenly moved into just three of them, she realized the area definitely needed to expand.

Renting a vehicle would require space, and planning for a farm would also need land; it seemed she had underestimated the requirements from the beginning.

After discussing the need for space expansion with Xu Jin, he agreed; four people living there was manageable, but with more people, it felt cramped.

Determined to act, Wen Keke revised the layout. 
Her home was on the summit of Qi Mountain, but the terrain was not sharply peaked; it was gently sloped, with a large mountain body. It was high enough to avoid flooding during rainy seasons.

Currently, "Warm Community" occupied the westernmost edge of the summit, with a road in front of the villas, a small forest to the left, and the entrance on the right where the road curved.

Wen Keke decided to install a railing around the mountaintop; the community entrance wouldn’t change, as the road couldn’t be expanded, but the area could be enlarged in the back.

She could simply relocate her villa.

Without hesitation, Wen Keke took out a set of small robots, Ai1 through Ai10, from her space. She saved the name “Ai” for the original model.

Directing the Ai robots via a command from Xingyun, they started to dismantle the colorful lights and railings surrounding the community.

Wen Keke figured that with the area expanding, there was no longer a need for railings for aesthetics, as they were mainly for a smaller area.

Now, concrete and gravel were needed, and she left the rest to Xingyun while she focused on placing the buildings.

Following the original layout, Wen Keke continued until she reached the area around her villa, at which point she called Ji He to help store the villa into her space.

Upon learning about the expansion plans, Ji He handed Wen Keke a silver-gray spray bottle.

“What’s this?” Wen Keke asked, puzzled.

Ji He smiled slightly, a rare sight that illuminated his usually expressionless face. His smile revealed a small dimple on one side, and his eyes sparkled like the sun, making him exceptionally approachable.

He flicked her forehead lightly, “Focus.”

Wen Keke blushed, covering her forehead, and replied, “Haha, Ji He… no, you smile so beautifully.”

Almost called him Ji, but this was the first time she had seen him smile. How could she forget with her fondness for attractive faces?

Ji He raised an eyebrow with a hint of mischief, his voice soft and smooth, reminiscent of a cold bottle of sparkling water in summer, a sound that lingered in one's heart.

“This is the Silver Spray. It’s waterproof, fireproof, and insect-proof. If you dilute it one-to-one with water and spray it on buildings, it guarantees they won’t collapse for fifty years.”

Wen Keke’s eyes sparkled. How did Ji He always manage to appear just when she needed something? He seemed like a walking toolkit!

“Thank you so much, Ji He! I truly need this!” she exclaimed excitedly.

Ji He nodded lightly, “Mm.”

Wen Keke happily stored the Silver Spray in her space and continued her construction tasks around the community. 
Ji He watched her retreating figure, preparing to head to his room when suddenly a sharp pain shot through his head, causing him to faint.

—

“Little Star~ Little Star~ I’m here to find you again!” 
A little girl in a princess dress climbed down from the wall to crouch beside a small boy, whose body was marked with injuries.

“Little Star, are you hurt again? Anan will blow on it for you—”

“Ah… Anan…” The boy opened his eyes and managed a faint smile.

“You're back again…” 

“Little Star, I brought you some healing potion! Quickly drink it! Don’t let that bad man catch you.”

The girl, called Anan, cautiously took out a vial of green liquid from her space ring, lifting the boy’s neck to carefully feed him.

“Thank you, Anan…” The boy’s eyes shimmered as he gazed at her.

Suddenly, footsteps could be heard approaching. 
The boy excitedly urged, “Hurry! He’s coming back!”

Anan, alarmed, quickly climbed up the wall, glancing back at the boy. 
“Little Star, wait for me to come back tomorrow!” 

With that, she jumped over and disappeared.

The boy smiled and nodded, “Okay!”

As the footsteps drew nearer, he closed his eyes again after watching Anan leave…

—

Ji He opened his eyes, rubbing his temple, and winced. 
His memories had returned a bit more…

Realizing he was in a villa they had previously used for a hotpot meal, he deduced that it was the people from Xing Lou who had brought him here.

Sitting up quietly, he closed his eyes again, thinking of Anan… Wen Keke…

Meanwhile, Wen Keke had already arranged all the buildings and placed the villa near the edge of the small forest, still connected to the road, ensuring it remained quiet while being convenient for travel.

For the vehicle rental station, she designated a plot of land at the community entrance, while the library’s location remained in the middle. She also left large areas of land on both the left and right sides of the community.

As for the farm, it didn’t necessarily need to be on flat ground due to the presence of Huilue Stone; any spot would suffice for planting.

Feeling satisfied with her progress, Wen Keke clapped her hands, declaring, “All done!”
