**Chapter: "Jasper's Little Gift"**

Wendy Keke suppresses her curiosity and says to the anxious Principal Lee before her, “This stone is quite useful. I was planning to set up a farm soon, trying my hand at growing vegetables and raising livestock! This stone comes at just the right time!

“How about this: I’ll allocate a few buildings for you. The function of this stone can cover your accommodations for one year. I’ll also deposit 10,000 points into each of your accounts, which should be enough for food and drink during this period. The rest will depend on your own abilities.”

After all, the base in Hua Country will definitely be completed eventually. Whether everyone chooses to live at the base or here can be discussed later, Wendy thought to herself.

“I’ll also give you points for meals. It’s unrealistic to cook all the time, as the supermarket has everything you need. You can use the points to buy food, and it’s up to you if you want to eat individually or together.”

Wendy then turned to Hu Qingyun and the others. 

“Great! Sounds good! We accept!” Hu Qingyun rubbed his hands together, a broad smile on his face, finally relieved that they could eat their fill!

Although Principal Lee and the others didn’t fully understand the concept of points, they were overwhelmed with emotion at the thought of having a place to live for a year.

“Thank you! Thank you so much, Miss Wendy! Don’t worry! We have students majoring in agriculture and animal husbandry here. Although I’m older, I’ve achieved some success in biology. If you need anything, just say the word, and we'll be there without hesitation!”

Principal Lee was barely able to contain his excitement, thrilled that his students would be able to survive. At his age, he felt there was little left for him, but these students were only teenagers in their twenties—the future of Hua Country!

Wendy summoned Xu Jin to help these individuals understand the exchange and purchasing procedures at the inn while also sorting out their rooms.

Each building had twenty-six floors, with two apartments on each floor. Each apartment contained three bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom, with balconies. This meant that three individuals could share a room, organized by gender.

Xu Jin recorded the number of males and females: 376 boys, 145 girls, totaling 531 individuals. The girls would share rooms in 49 units across one building, while the boys would be split into 125 units across three buildings, including arrangements for Hu Qingyun and Principal Lee.

Xu Jin decided to allocate these people to buildings G, H, and J, as they were close together for convenience.

He then demonstrated how to use the points exchange machine and how to make purchases in the supermarket.

After finishing recording everyone’s details and sending them to their rooms, Xu Jin emerged from the building, wiping the sweat from his brow.

The sight of the supermarket seemed to ignite a spark in the eyes of those young people; they truly were youthful and eager!

Jasper had already returned to his room at the villa when the starship arrived, while Tai Shu Jiyu dived straight into the supermarket for a shopping spree.

Wendy returned to her room and took out the stone, hoping it could be replicated in her space. Just then, her stomach growled a few times.

Wendy glanced at the clock and realized it was already afternoon. She’d only had breakfast; no wonder she was so hungry!

Deciding to make some rice noodles today, she remembered the popular spicy tripe rice noodles she had seen earlier in the city. Even though she had noodles from that store in her space, she wanted to try making them herself.

First, she prepared a red broth by slicing up some pickled vegetables and adding a spoonful of salt, chicken essence, monosodium glutamate, and pepper powder. She then poured in some soy sauce along with two tablespoons of chili oil, added lard, ginger-garlic water, some sesame paste, and filled it up with hot water, finally sprinkling green onions on top and mixing it well.

Next, she fried a few eggs to add to her noodles later, and now it was time for the star ingredient: the tripe!

She heated oil in a pan, added half a small bowl of chili powder, and sautéed it until fragrant. In went the cleaned tripe, which she stir-fried for about twenty seconds before adding chives, salt, chicken essence, and monosodium glutamate, continuing to stir before adding the soy sauce and plating it.

When the water boiled, she dropped in the noodles, which she cooked until done before placing them into the already prepared red broth and topping it off with the stir-fried tripe. A bowl of spicy tripe rice noodles was complete!

Outside, the aroma of meals prepared by those students wafted in, making Wendy inhale deeply. Mmm! It smelled like braised pork. That’ll be next on her list!

Xu Jin, as usual, came to take a bowl and chopsticks as soon as the meal was ready. As the four gathered around the dining table, Tai Shu Jiyu handed Wendy a spatial ring.

Wendy looked at Tai Shu Jiyu, puzzled, “What’s this for?”

Tai Shu Jiyu playfully pinched Wendy’s cheek, “Just something for you to play with~”

Curious, Wendy examined the spatial ring.

!!!

Inside this ring that was the size of a soccer field, it was filled with gold!!!

Wendy felt her breath hitch for a few seconds, “This is way too much! I can’t accept this!”

Though she loved money and enjoyed getting bargains, she knew when it was right to take what others offered. Yet, it still pained her to turn down so much gold!

Tai Shu Jiyu raised an eyebrow, “If you don’t want it, just toss it away. I never take back things I give away. Or you can just consider it payment for today’s clothes.”

Sigh, gifting something to her little kitten proved to be quite the challenge. After the Blue Star plan, she’d quickly take her kitten home to show her how wealthy her family was.

However, thinking about the kitten’s background, a moment of contemplation crossed Tai Shu Jiyu’s eyes; she still hadn’t found who the kitten’s parents were within the Tai Shu family.

Wendy understood the kind of person Tai Shu Jiyu was, so she had no choice but to accept the ring.

“Then... thank you, Sister Jiyu.” Wendy decided in her heart to gift Sister Jiyu some suitable clothing since she felt uneasy about accepting so much gold!

Besides, she loved changing up beautiful people's outfits!

Meanwhile, Jasper quickly finished his rice noodles and broth, rushing back to his room. Wendy didn’t think much of it; after all, Jasper was always so capricious.

After finishing her meal, Wendy returned to her room to rest. Just as she lay on the bed, she felt something poking her.

Sitting up to look, she found—

Isn’t this a potion that only Jasper would have?

But why was this vial gold-colored? She had never seen one like it!

At that moment, Starfall excitedly exclaimed, “Master! This is the Philosopher's Stone Potion. Just one drop on a stone will turn it into gold! This potion is banned in the Ailan Star System!”

Wendy’s hand trembled as she held the potion, then steadied it rapidly.

“Starfall… what did you say this potion is?”

Starfall obediently replied, “Master, it’s the Philosopher's Stone Potion!”

Wendy handled the golden potion with utmost care as if it were a golden dream come true!

She began imagining how her space could replicate one potion a day: one in a day, four in two days, eight in three days...

In just a few days, wouldn’t she have as much gold as she desired?

But recalling Starfall's words made her realize that such an incredible potion being banned was understandable. What would happen if she used it? Thinking about this, Wendy finally asked aloud.

“Master, Blue Star is considered a very backward planet in the Ailan Star System; it wouldn’t matter if you used the potion!”

Wendy felt reassured, placing the potion safely in her space.

She then wondered why Jasper would give her this potion. She recalled the day after drinking with friends, feeling unwell during lunch, only to discover a healing potion in her room.

All her potions were kept in her space and never left out. At the time, she thought she had accidentally taken it out, which would mean it was something Jasper had placed there...

Why would Jasper give her a potion?

Wendy had an inkling of the answer forming in her heart but didn’t dare believe it. After all, it seemed impossible!

She wasn’t low on emotional intelligence and had some awareness of these matters, but she couldn’t recall any instance where Jasper had shown any affection towards her.

Nowhere at all!

Wendy shook her head, deciding that it was improbable, thinking instead that Jasper was just overly generous because she cooked well!

After all, Jasper really loved to eat!
