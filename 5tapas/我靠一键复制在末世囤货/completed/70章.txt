**My Fate Is in My Own Hands, Not in Heaven**

The next morning, with the air still thick with mist, Coco Wen was all set to go. 

For ease of movement, Coco wore athletic gear while Ji He sported a matching couple’s outfit in black, mirroring Coco's style. Meanwhile, Taishu Ji Yu donned a long black dress.

The trio stood by the flood control embankment, awaiting the arrival of the Dawn Base personnel. Coco had also brought along her pet cat, Gentleman, a striking black feline. When she inquired with Xu Jin about the cat’s ownership, he revealed that it came out of the woods and was a stray, thus Coco decided to name it Gentleman, as it displayed remarkable manners.

Earlier that morning, she had found a small white flower at her door, undoubtedly brought by Gentleman.

“Boss, look, Gentleman has arrived!” Coco exclaimed. Xu Jin, having already learned about Gentleman from Coco, couldn’t help but admire the cat for its boldness in stealing her beloved pet, Jinbao.

With a thumbs-up gesture, they watched as a sleek black cat emerged gracefully from the morning fog, strutting with pride. Its shiny black fur gleamed in the light, exuding a regal aura, reminiscent of a lion patrolling its territory.

“Meow~” Jinbao jumped from Coco’s arms, running over to Gentleman, nuzzling its head against the cat’s. Gentleman turned, affectionately gazing at Jinbao, their tails entwined—one small and delicate, the other grand and commanding, like a couple deeply in love.

Coco: *Silently accepting this bowl of dog food.*

Ji He glanced at the two cats, then at Coco, grasping her hand tightly, his other arm wrapping around her shoulder and pulling her toward him.

Coco: *???*

Taishu Ji Yu observed the two cats and then the affectionate pair, stifling a laugh that threatened to escape.

“Master, the Dawn Base personnel is on their way!” Xingyun announced.

Coco, pushed aside her curiosity about Ji He’s actions and said, “Let’s get started!”

“Understood, Master!” 

Coco activated the black ring bracelet on her wrist, and a dark shadow expanded from its center, revealing a formidable ship, black and sleek, with a massive deck capable of accommodating tens of thousands of people.

As the illusion solidified, the ship’s exterior shimmered as if coated in oil. It loomed like a beast amid the roaring floodwaters, ready to pounce at the slightest provocation.

The vessel had five levels: the first floor was the dining area, the second floor housed sleeping quarters, the third was an entertainment lounge brimming with diversions, the fourth was a gym, and the fifth was an open-air garden that resembled a lush forest due to its size.

The front deck was retractable. With a single button from the control room, an array of laser weaponry would lock onto enemies. The ship was encased in a virtual energy shield—a true reflection of all Xingyun's skills.

The three of them, along with the two cats, boarded the ship. In the distance, they spotted a green line on the horizon—the Dawn Base army. Military vehicles marched steadily towards them.

The general in the lead vehicle caught sight of the "beast" above the floodwaters from afar. “Wow, that’s stunning!” he exclaimed, unable to resist pulling out binoculars to stare in awe.

For a man, especially a soldier, such a powerful ship adorned with weaponry felt akin to a woman spotting exquisite makeup.

“Miss Wen is incredible! What a benevolent soul!” Sun Zhi, seated nearby, chimed in. His entire team was deployed for this supply mission, and while he already knew Miss Wen was impressive, he hadn't expected something this grand—where had she been hiding this ship?

Though Lin Jiaojiao maintained her stoic demeanor, her eyes shimmered with pride.

As the convoy approached the embankment, all vehicle doors swung open simultaneously. Agile soldiers clad in standard green uniforms quickly disembarked.

The troops assembled into neat formations on the open ground, and once everyone had gathered, General Wei and Lin Jiaojiao made their way to Coco.

“Miss Wen, we appreciate your hard work,” General Wei said with a smile, recalling how the commander had insisted he treat her with utmost respect, ensuring she felt the gratitude and esteem of the Huaguo government.

Internally, General Wei scoffed at the thought but now found himself starstruck. “Miss Wen is amazing—come on board!”

Standing on the deck, Coco, perhaps influenced by the enhancement serum she'd taken, could read the expressions of the soldiers below clearly, and she smiled gently.

“It’s no trouble at all—everyone's welcome aboard!”

Suppressing the urge to approach her, General Wei called to his troops. “Line up and board the ship!”

“Understood!” the soldiers responded in unison, their voices ringing clear and strong, cutting through the noise of the raging waters, bringing life to the atmosphere.

Each soldier carried a large backpack, stepping onto the deck with solemn expressions. Coco explained the ship's layout to General Wei.

The first-level resting area featured 12,000 rooms, each with ten single beds. Coco's group was assigned to the fifth floor, a perk afforded to the owner of the vessel. The top deck was quiet, housing the control room as well.

Once everyone was ready, the ship began to move slowly, emitting a long, resonant hum as the words "Xingyun" glimmered on the water's surface. This sight stirred Xu Jin with uncontainable excitement.

He scribbled in his notebook:  

*January 2, 2076*  
*On this day, Boss Wen led her hundred thousand soldiers, heading north...*  

Flipping the notebook open, he noted the title: *The Chronicles of Boss Wen: My Fate Is in My Own Hands, Not in Heaven.*
