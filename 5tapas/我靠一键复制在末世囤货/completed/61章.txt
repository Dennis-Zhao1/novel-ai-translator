**Waiting for You on a Rainy Day (2)**

"I brought you my notes. Make sure to rest well and don’t overdo it. What did the school nurse say? Can you attend class this evening? Do you want me to help you take a leave?" 

Clara Joy placed the notebook by the bedside, then poured a glass of hot water for the girl lying on the bed. Her expression was sincere as she spoke. 

Emma Wen glanced down, her cheeks slightly flushed. "I know, thank you, class monitor. The nurse said I could return to the classroom tonight." 

Clara nodded and tucked the blanket around Emma more snugly. "Then I won’t help you take leave tonight. Just rest well; I won’t disturb you." 

"Okay, thank you, class monitor." 

That evening, Emma Wen left the school infirmary and observed her surroundings carefully. The plot provided only limited information; everything else would depend on her own efforts. 

"Classmate Lu, how are you feeling?" 

Emma halted and looked up, seeing the school's psychologist, Dr. Ethan Lin, across from her. 

Dr. Lin was tall and handsome with a clear complexion, and as he worked indoors most of the time, his skin was fair. He carried a certain professionalism that made one instinctively trust him; many girls at school admired him. 

"Dr. Lin, I’m feeling much better," Emma replied, mirroring Lu Xiaoyu’s previously shy demeanor. 

Based on her many years of reading novels, she sensed that psychologists often had their issues. 

Dr. Lin nodded. "Take care of yourself, and remember to balance studying with relaxation." 

Emma nodded earnestly. "I will, Dr. Lin." 

"Good." 

After seeing her serious expression, Dr. Lin took his leave. 

Emma watched as he walked away, noticing his confident stride with broad arm movements and an upright posture—he carried himself with a self-assured air. 

Reflecting on some information about Dr. Lin, she recalled that he came from a wealthy family with harmonious parents, graduated from the country's top psychology university, opened a counseling clinic after graduation, and worked as a psychologist at the school. 

Two years ago, he married a woman chosen by his family, who loved pastries, prompting him to open a bakery. They currently had no children and Dr. Lin was a prominent figure at school, adored by many girls. 

At first glance, there seemed to be no problems, but a gut feeling prompted Emma to keep Dr. Lin as a focus of her attention. 

Returning to her class, Clara Joy greeted her and a few classmates before they all returned to studying since they were in their second year of high school, and the pressure of preparing for the third year loomed ahead. 

Emma sat at her desk, her eyes on the English homework in front of her, but her mind was already rummaging through the special tools in her backpack. 

**[Rainy Night Spirit]: Transform into any species from a rainy night (usage time: half an hour, cooldown: five minutes)** 
**[You Are Me, I Am You]: Body swap for fifteen minutes (can be used by anyone, cooldown: twenty minutes)** 
**[Child of Time]: Rewind time by ten minutes (one-time use only)** 

Wow! The **[Child of Time]** looks pretty good! 

"Xiaoyu, are you alright?" 

Startled from her daze, Emma looked over to see Clara observing her with concern. 

"Oh, I’m fine. I was just a bit lost in thought," Emma replied sheepishly. 

Clara frowned slightly. "Why don’t you go back to the dorm and rest? You don’t seem well today." 

After thinking it over, Emma agreed that returning to the dorm was a good idea. 

Back in her dorm, Emma assessed her surroundings. As the best high school in Haiyan City, every student was required to live on campus, though there weren't any extra classes on weekends. Students could choose to return home or stay at the school. 

Emma shared a room with three other girls: Clara Joy, the monitor; Tang Lu, the literature committee member; and Gao Xiaoxing. The dorms were assigned based on academic performance, and Tang Lu was an exceptionally beautiful girl—fair-skinned with long legs, bright and studious, coming from a well-off family, truly a "rich beauty."

Gao Xiaoxing, based on her usual attire, also seemed to come from a decent family and was quite cheerful and lively. Emma, inhabiting Lu Xiaoyu's body, also came from a good family; both her parents were white-collar workers, but they were often away, leaving Xiaoyu to live mostly on her own. 

In contrast, Clara’s family wasn't as wealthy; every year, she applied for poverty assistance and various scholarships, working the hardest among the four. 

The relationships in their dorm were quite normal; there were no significant conflicts. 

With nothing unusual in the dorm, Emma planned to approach the investigation from the perspective of the victim and took out her phone to check the news but discovered that articles about the incident had all been buried. 

Sigh… guess I'll have to find other avenues for information. 

Just as she was about to climb into bed, her peripheral vision caught something. 

Huh? 

Emma approached Tang Lu's desk and discovered a newspaper tucked in one corner. 

Picking it up, she read the headline: **“Foggy Day Dismemberment Case in Haiyan City.”** This newspaper contained information about a dismemberment case! 

Why would a wealthy girl like Tang Lu have something like this? 

In this digital age, it was surprising to see an actual newspaper making an appearance again, especially on Tang Lu’s desk. 

After contemplating, Emma placed the newspaper back where she found it and took photos of the relevant articles regarding the dismemberment case. 

This was a crucial lead. 

Lying on her bed, she reviewed the photos she had taken and summarized the information. 

**Victim 1:** A 25-year-old woman who worked at a convenience store. She was on duty during the foggy day and was found dismembered the next day. 
**Victim 2:** A first-year student at the school, reportedly one of the top three students academically, from a less fortunate family. She was dismembered at home on the foggy weekend, and her parents caused a scene at school, but since she died at home, they couldn't get much sympathy from the school. 
**Victim 3:** A third-year music student, who had won several national music awards. She was dismembered that night while on the street. 

Emma rubbed her head, noticing no apparent connection between these three victims aside from their gender. 

At that moment, the dorm door creaked open, and Clara and the other two walked in. Checking the time, Emma realized it was already after evening study hours. 

"Xiaoyu, are you feeling better?" 

Seeing Emma still awake, Clara dropped her backpack and asked. 

"I'm much better, thank you, class monitor," Emma replied with a soft smile. 

"Xiaoyu, I noticed you didn't eat much today, so I brought you some snacks." 

Tang Lu set a fragrant bag on Emma's bedside table. 

Emma wasn't surprised; coming from a wealthy family, Tang Lu often treated them to snacks, and they reciprocated occasionally. 

"Thank you, Lu." 

As she expressed her gratitude, Emma casually asked Tang Lu, "By the way, how come there's a newspaper on your desk? Did you buy it?" 

Tang Lu, who was changing into her pajamas, looked over at her desk when she heard the question. 

"Huh? Why is there a newspaper on my desk? Is it one of yours?" 

Seeing Tang Lu appear genuinely surprised, Clara interjected, "It's mine; I must have accidentally left it on your desk." 

Taking the newspaper back, Clara clarified. 

Tang Lu seemed nonchalant but curiously asked, "Class monitor, are you actually interested in this dismemberment case?" 

Emma couldn’t help but silently applaud Tang Lu for asking what she wanted to.
