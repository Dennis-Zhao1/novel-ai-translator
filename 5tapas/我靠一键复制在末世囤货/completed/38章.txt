**Oh, this awkward moment.**

When Wen Keke returned once more, she noticed that Lin Jiaojiao was nowhere in sight. 

Ji He leaned against the doorframe, pretending to be nonchalant as he glanced at Wen Keke's back. “Where’s that friend of yours? Why didn’t you bring her in?”

Stopping in her tracks, Wen Keke replied in surprise, “You mean Jiaojiao? She already went back to the base in S City.”

Ji He felt puzzled. Jiaojiao? Why would a grown man have such a name? “Jiaojiao? Isn’t that a man’s name?”

Wen Keke looked at Ji He with wide eyes, astonished. “When did Jiaojiao become a man? She’s my best friend, and we grew up together! She’s a girl!”

The last part was emphasized with a weighty tone, underscoring that Jiaojiao was indeed a girl. Ji He finally understood, clearing his throat, “Oh.”

“By the way, Jiaojiao just told me that someone from the government is coming over soon. Do you want to disclose your identity?” Wen Keke winked at Ji He.

Earlier, she and Lin Jiaojiao had discussed many things in the car; Jiaojiao had shared a lot about City A, the Zhao family, and the Wang family’s current situation. She also mentioned that people from Huaguo seemed to know her father and that recently, someone might be sent to her neighborhood.

In Wen Keke’s mind, her father was just a relatively wealthy businessman; how could he have any connections with those people? She also thought about the two aliens in her neighborhood who didn’t even have ID cards. If Huaguo couldn’t find their identities, they would definitely raise suspicions.

Ji He’s long hair floated in the breeze, playful strands brushing against his delicate profile, leaving a mark of ink across his face. Unable to resist, Wen Keke reached up to smooth down his hair.

Noticing the odd look Ji He gave her, Wen Keke realized what she had done. The atmosphere turned awkward; she quickly withdrew her hand, fidgeting with her fingers behind her back. She had to admit, alien hair was incredibly smooth.

“Cough, cough. So, um… I just did it out of habit, not sure why… just went ahead and did it, haha, don’t mind it! It’s nothing important!” Wen Keke attempted to cover the awkwardness with laughter.

Ji He averted his gaze calmly, but internally he was delighted. Anan has petted my hair again; I am still Anan's best friend!

“I’ve already disclosed my identity; they already know,” Ji He said casually.

“What??? Aren't you at the villa every day?" Wen Keke was astonished. Ever since Ji He arrived at the villa, he hardly ever went outside, and the only times he did were when he went to the city center with her.

Wait! Since he came… “Did you disclose it before coming to the villa?” Wen Keke asked again.

“Yeah!” Ji He nodded.

Wen Keke understood then. There was nothing to worry about; they would just wait for the people to arrive. 

During this time, Hu Qingyun and his students in water conservancy engineering had also been working with high-tech robots to finish the flood control levee. 

“Manager Xu, the levee work is complete,” Hu Qingyun said, accompanied by his students, to Xu Jin, who was standing nearby.

Xu Jin smiled and nodded, then seemed to recall something, addressing Hu Qingyun, “Mr. Hu, Principal Li went to the library again and hasn’t come out for half a day.”

Hu Qingyun widened his eyes. During this time, he also regained his previous impressive appearance, though he still looked a bit frail. 

“Why is he taking so long again? I told him multiple times his health can’t handle such strain, why won’t he listen?” Hu Qingyun dropped what he was holding and sped towards the library, ready to give the old man a piece of his mind.

Meanwhile, at the military base, Wang Youshan and Wang Youguo, along with General Wei, were preparing to head to Qiju Mountain. By the way, Lin Jiaojiao was also called to join since General Wei and the others understood the relationship between Lin Jiaojiao and Wen Keke. 

At this moment, Wen Keke was bathing Jinbao, and the temperature had risen to around ten degrees; much of the snow had melted. Looking at the date, Wen Keke felt that the flood season would arrive in a week or two.

“Master! The person you marked is driving toward the villa!” Xingyun’s voice suddenly rang in her ear.

As Wen Keke blew Jinbao’s fur dry, she quickened her pace. “Xingyun, activate meeting room mode!”

“Understood, Master!”

Recently, Xingyun had been renovating Wen Keke's villa. The so-called meeting room mode shifted the living room on the first floor outside the villa using advanced technology, creating a separate house.

The materials for this house came from the most top-notch interstellar materials provided by Xingyun. It could automatically adjust the temperature based on the weather and alter seating arrangements according to the number of people. It also had many functions that seemed useful to Wen Keke, though Xingyun didn’t quite understand their significance.

For instance, it could automatically change the colors of seats based on the mood of the incoming guests, or analyze the mood of the task at hand and provide their favorite drinks for the day…

Xingyun expressed confusion: "Can’t grasp it."

After finishing with Jinbao, Wen Keke changed into clothes she had prepared. After all, this was her first time meeting someone who she normally only saw on TV, so she wanted to dress formally.

As she descended the stairs, she saw Ji He, Xu Jin, and her long-lost great-uncle Ji Yu downstairs. Recently, she hadn’t seen Ji sister often; she only ran into her during meals. According to Xu Jin, Ji sister was always either at the gashapon machine or shopping in supermarkets, or just staying in her room.

Wen Keke thought… why did Ji sister seem to have a slightly rounder face?

Cough, cough, can’t say that! Given Ji sister’s usual concern for her appearance, bringing that up would mean certain death!

*Knock, knock—*

A knock echoed from the door. Wen Keke walked towards it, with Ji He and the others trailing behind her. The villa's main door opened slowly.

Seeing Wen Keke and the others, Wang Youshan and the others were momentarily awestruck. 

These four were undeniably beautiful and handsome. 

Wang Youshan nodded toward Ji He, then turned to glance at the two girls in front of him: one lively and spirited, the other alluringly beautiful. 

If he guessed correctly, the one on the left must be the daughter of Wen Jingshu since both had almond-shaped eyes, while the other girl, although equally stunning, had fox-like eyes.

Wang Youshan smiled slightly and shook hands with Wen Keke. “You must be Mr. Wen’s daughter, Wen Keke.”

Wen Keke extended her hand to shake back, “Yes, I am Wen Keke. Let’s head into the meeting room!”

Lin Jiaojiao, standing behind General Wei, exchanged a glance with Wen Keke; this calmed Wen Keke’s racing heart a little.

Wen Keke led everyone into the meeting room, where Wang Youshan took the main seat, followed by Commander Wang and General Wei, with Lin Jiaojiao sitting next to them. 

Wen Keke and the others took their seats across from them.

An awkward scene ensued; cough, cough, Wen Keke had forgotten to turn off the chair color adjustment feature. 

Wen Keke’s chair turned blue, Ji sister’s was white, Xu Jin’s orange, and Ji He’s pink. 

Across from them, Wang Youshan and Commander Wang were seated on red chairs, while General Wei was also red, and Lin Jiaojiao’s chair was a light blue. 

Wen Keke’s face flushed with embarrassment, hastily instructing Xingyun to turn off the function. Slowly, the chairs returned to their original wood color.
