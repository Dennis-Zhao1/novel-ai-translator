**The Wristband**

Once Wen Keke finished organizing the books in the library, Little Ai had also completed laying the heated flooring in the supermarket. Wen Keke instructed Little Ai to continue with the library's flooring as she made her way back to the supermarket.

As she reached the entrance of the supermarket, Wen Keke looked up and took down the old sign. She had prepared a metal plate similar to the one at the Warm Inn. After painting it white, she wrote in large blue letters "Warm Supermarket" and applied a layer of fluorescent paint to ensure it was visible at night.

Pleased with her calligraphy skills, Wen Keke nodded while looking at the sign hanging at the entrance. She stepped inside the supermarket, where the shelves remained in place but were entirely empty; all the previous items were unusable, having spoiled. Even the clothes and towels had become brittle from being frozen for too long and fell apart upon touch.

Little Ai had cleaned the shelves thoroughly, and a wave of warmth emanated from the supermarket, contrasting with the biting cold outside. Wen Keke turned off the floor heating and locked up the supermarket, planning to reopen it once there were guests at the inn.

Returning to the library, she found that Little Ai had finished laying the heating on the bottom three floors. After inspecting the work, Wen Keke wandered around to see what additional supplies might be needed.

Once she was satisfied with Little Ai's progress, she headed back to the villa. By the time she returned, it was already past ten o'clock, and she noticed there were now two buildings in her space, with the amount of herbal medicine doubling.

Suddenly, Wen Keke had a thought: Could Little Ai be replicated? Excited by the prospect, she decided to wait until Little Ai was finished with her tasks.

While heading upstairs to her bedroom, she encountered Mr. Ji He standing by the window. Wen Keke greeted him, “Good morning, Mr. Ji.”

Ji He turned his head to glance at Wen Keke and replied curtly, “Mm.”

At this moment, Xu Jin heard the commotion outside and opened the door. After a day and night of rest, Xu Jin's complexion had improved somewhat, though he still looked pale and a bit frail.

Seeing Wen Keke and Ji He outside, Xu Jin smiled, “Good morning, Wen Keke, Mr. Ji.”

Wen Keke returned the smile, while Ji He remained silent, giving Wen Keke a brief look before turning back to his room. Xu Jin observed Ji He before turning back to Wen Keke, understanding the tension; it seemed Ji He did not particularly like him.

Feeling a bit awkward, Wen Keke chimed in, “Ahem, Mr. Ji, haha, you two just aren't familiar yet! You will be in no time!”

Xu Jin displayed a faint smile, “I understand. Right now, I just want to live; I won't care too much about anything else.”

Wen Keke could only laugh it off. Just then, Ji He opened the door again and called to Wen Keke, “Come in.”

After finishing his statement, he closed the door again. 

Wen Keke looked taken aback while Xu Jin smirked, finally understanding why Ji He seemed displeased with him. Xu Jin encouraged Wen Keke, “Better go in; Mr. Ji probably has something for you.”

Xu Jin found it amusing to watch how the end of the world could still have such interaction. 

Wen Keke replied skeptically, “Probably…?” She wondered if Mr. Ji was going to give her something impressive again today!

Feeling excited, she took a moment to compose herself and knocked on Ji He’s door. 

“Knock, knock—”

“Come in.” Ji He's voice came from inside.

Wen Keke opened the door and stepped in, gently closing it behind her. She glanced around Ji He's room, which appeared unchanged, and the bedsheets were still neat as if they hadn't been slept on.

“Mr. Ji, did you need something?” Wen Keke asked quietly.

Ji He frowned, looking at her with a hint of annoyance. “Why are you acting so sneaky?”

Wen Keke straightened up, looking innocent. “I’m not being sneaky!” 

Who is being sneaky? Not me, I swear!

Without further comment on that, Ji He handed Wen Keke something. 

“Room fee.”

Wen Keke took it; it resembled a wristband and was entirely black with a matte finish and a button on the side. Curiously, she pressed the button, and a virtual cannon emerged from the top.

Wen Keke stared at Ji He in astonishment, “Is this... a cannon?”

Ji He sat on the sofa, crossing his legs, casually chewing on grape-flavored candy. His posture gave him a slightly youthful air, and he responded coolly, “Laser cannon wristband. Its range extends up to a thousand meters, capable of demolishing a building with one shot. It requires no energy source and can be used indefinitely.”

He cast a curious glance at Wen Keke. 

Wen Keke couldn’t help but remember the time she used a rocket launcher on him and laughed nervously, “Hehe, but you did hit me once, too!”

Ji He turned to gaze outside the window, saying, “Input your genetic password; press your hand on it.”

Wen Keke followed his instructions, placing her finger on the wristband. The device detected her fingerprint and a needle emerged from the top, pricking her finger gently.

It felt like being bitten by an insect for a moment, and then a voice announced, “Genetic password input success. Name: Wen Keke. Age: 20. Genetic status: Analysis failed. Happy to serve you, Master! I am Starfall.”

Wen Keke looked at Ji He in confusion, “This is... a laser cannon?”

A talking laser cannon? 

Ji He crunched his candy loudly, his expression calm. “Oh, the laser cannon is just one of its functions; it’s an intelligent weapon butler.”

Having said that, Ji He seemed unwilling to continue the topic and stated, “The room fee is paid. We're having hot pot for lunch.”

Wen Keke realized he was signaling her to leave and quickly replied, “Of course, no problem!” 

She dashed upstairs, leaving Ji He’s room, and returned to her bedroom to further investigate the “Starfall” wristband.

Upon entering her room, she spotted Jin Bao and thought about how she hadn't spent much time playing with him lately. So, she picked him up and cuddled for a while.

Then, sitting on the bed, she pressed the button on the wristband again, activating the virtual cannon display.

“Hello, Master. Starfall is here to serve you.”

Wen Keke couldn't resist a grin at the cannon's absurdity and curiously asked, “Can you only transform into this cannon? Nothing else?”

Having a cannon address her felt quite strange...

The mechanical voice of Starfall responded, “Of course not. However, as Ji He gentleman mentioned, Starfall is a laser cannon, so I transformed into one.”

Continuing with Starfall's line, Wen Keke asked, “So you can change into different forms?”

“Absolutely. I can take any form you desire, Master.”

Starfall's tone had a hint of pride.

Wen Keke raised an eyebrow, “Then let's start with the form of Ji He!”

Starfall hesitated for a moment but obediently replied, “Certainly… Master.”

As Ji He had said, the being before her was her servant, and it must follow her commands; even Ji He could not compel it to go against her orders!
