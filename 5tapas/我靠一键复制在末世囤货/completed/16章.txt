Library

As the two were enjoying their meal, Xu Jin was awakened by an enticing aroma filling the room. 

Opening his eyes groggily, he looked around the building, feeling a long-lost warmth. 

Is this... heaven? 

He sniffed the air. Does this heaven come with food? 

It smells so good~ 

Xu Jin threw off the covers and got out of bed. He glanced at himself, still in the same clothes he had worn before, then looked around the room, feeling the warmth beneath his feet—this place had underfloor heating. 

Xu Jin realized he had been rescued. 

As he opened the door, he followed the wonderful aroma wafting up from the upper floor. Before he could move, Wen Keke upstairs had already heard the sound of the door opening. 

Since being injured that day, Wen Keke had noticed that her senses of hearing and smell had become much more acute than before. 

Thinking of this, she sneaked a glance at the one enjoying their meal, Ji He. 

Ji He sensed her gaze but didn’t respond, having long been used to attracting attention from women in the interstellar era. 

Wen Keke carried a pot of wolfberry chicken soup down from the kitchen. Just as she reached the bottom of the stairs, she saw Xu Jin standing at the door. 

“You’re awake? The chicken soup is ready!” 

Xu Jin stared, dazed, at Wen Keke coming down. The warm room and fragrant air made him feel as if he were before the apocalypse. But looking out of the floor-to-ceiling window, he was still greeted by a snowy white landscape and biting cold winds. 

“Wen Keke?” 

Xu Jin hesitantly asked. 

“It’s me,” Wen Keke replied while placing the soup on the dining table on the first floor. 

Confusion filled Xu Jin’s mind with questions about Wen Keke’s food, the cozy home she had, but he understood that it was not appropriate to pry into her personal matters. 

“Thank you for saving me,” Xu Jin expressed his gratitude. 

If it weren't for Wen Keke, he might have frozen to death today. Glancing at the steaming chicken soup, his throat couldn’t help but swallow. 

Seeing Xu Jin’s condition, Wen Keke realized he must have been hungry for a long time, so she set the bowls and chopsticks aside, letting him sit down to eat. 

Xu Jin devoured the chicken, drinking the soup eagerly, and in just a few minutes, he finished the entire pot. 

He leaned back in his chair, satisfied. Ever since the apocalypse began, he hadn’t tasted anything warm. The government’s relief had only consisted of compressed biscuits.  

“You…” 

“You…” 

They spoke simultaneously, and Wen Keke laughed, “You go first.” 

Xu Jin shyly brought his gaze down and asked, “Can I stay here for a while? I know it’s a lot to ask, but I have some weapons at my old house that I can give you.” 

The once proud young master of the Xu family now appeared like a child caught doing something wrong. Wen Keke felt a wave of sentiment; the apocalypse had indeed changed many people. 

But upon hearing Xu Jin’s offer, Wen Keke blinked, thinking that… this was quite an easy deal? 

“I was just about to ask if you’d like to stay. I actually need more help around here.” 

Even though Xu Jin didn’t understand why she needed more people—shouldn’t the world have fewer people in such times?—he hurriedly nodded, “Of course! I just need to wait until the weather warms up a bit to go back and fetch the weapons.” 

Wen Keke assured him that was fine. Finally, someone would come to help her with some tasks! 

After all, she needed to gather manpower for her inn, and trusting Xu Jin’s character was easy for her given he managed a large company by himself. Plus, free weapons were a bonus. 

Once they came to an agreement, Xu Jin settled in on the first floor of Wen Keke’s house. 

After chatting with Xu Jin, Wen Keke decided to inform Ji He that Xu Jin would also be staying, as they were both on the first floor, it was better to let him know. 

Ji He didn’t say much about it. 

While Xu Jin rested in his room, Wen Keke went over her stock of potions that she had recently acquired from Ji He. 

Green Potion: Healing potion, can instantly heal up to 80% of external bodily injuries. 

Yellow Potion: Adaptation potion, allows permanent adaptation to any temperature. 

Red Potion: Activation potion, maximizes potential tenfold. 

Purple Potion: Dizziness potion, can make someone faint for three minutes when sprayed in the air. 

Blue Potion: To be used in conjunction with the dizziness potion, ignoring the effects of the dizziness for five minutes after consumption. 

After some time in her space, she had managed to produce over a dozen vials of all potions, except for one transparent potion. 

It took six days to replicate just one of the transparent vials. Ji He had mentioned it was a copying potion but didn’t explain what it was used for, so she just stored it in her space. 

Now it seemed that this potion was quite special if it was so difficult to replicate. 

Wen Keke stroked her chin, pondering. 

After counting the potions, she noticed an obscured stone that the space couldn’t replicate—not a single copy had been made. 

Wen Keke reflected on Ji He’s words about belonging and felt a strange connection to him. 

But she still hadn’t grasped the full situation; for now, they were simply a landlord and tenant. 

Returning to her cheerful expression, Wen Keke planned to open a small supermarket near the entrance of what she now called the Warm Inn. 

When she acquired the building, she had also taken over the small community supermarket next door. 

Wen Keke drove her mobility scooter to the Warm Inn’s entrance and set the community supermarket on the left side, aligning the entrance with the main road. 

She then placed the library behind her villa to block the view from the community and create some quiet. 

Although there was currently no one in the community, Wen Keke firmly believed it would attract many people in the future! 

Looking at the library, the largest in City S, its collection was vast beyond measure. 

There was no book you couldn’t find, only books you hadn’t thought to seek out. 

The entire library was an oval-shaped building comprised of six floors, with each floor roughly the size of a gymnasium and equipped with restrooms, chairs, and lounges. 

The elevator was unusable, so Wen Keke began systematically transporting the library’s books and shelves into her space, planning to refurbish the library before returning them. The current state of the library was too dilapidated. 

First, she decided to replace all the shattered windows—the glass had already broken, and the interior was filled with ice that had to be dealt with. 

Another massive project ahead! 

Wen Keke sighed before getting started. 

She summoned Xiao Ai 3088, inputting commands to clear the snow and ice. 

“Command received!” 

Xiao Ai 3088 entered the library to begin cleaning up the snow and ice, while Wen Keke kept herself busy, retrieving a crane from her space and smashing the old windows one by one. 

After installing the new bulletproof one-way glass, it was already evening around 7 or 8 o’clock, but Xiao Ai 3088 had cleaned all the ice and snow inside. The supermarket area was still a mess, so Wen Keke decided to call it a night and resume work the next day! 

Wen Keke parked the crane back in her space and stored the glass shards, reasoning that they might come in handy later. 

She called Xiao Ai 3088 back and rushed to the villa to make dinner since she had spotted Ji He waiting at the entrance.
