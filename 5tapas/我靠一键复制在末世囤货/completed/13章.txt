**The Apocalypse Hotel**

Wen Keke looked puzzled and asked, “Hidden Stone? What’s its use?” 

Ji He turned, gazing at Wen Keke with deep meaning in his eyes, and replied softly, “It belongs to you.” 

Ji He didn’t elaborate further. Wen Keke realized it was best to leave it at that, since he wasn’t willing to say more. 

She brought out a bowl of noodles from the kitchen, placing a serving in front of Ji He and another for herself. Jinbao, their pet, had already been fed and was fast asleep. 

Wen Keke looked expectantly at Ji He, hoping he would share more treasures with her. She cheerfully said, “You must try my tomato soup noodles—they're delicious!” 

She rubbed her hands together in anticipation, thinking that it was a great deal to exchange a meal for such a rare item! If all else failed, she could let him hit her again—she had forgiven him for the last time! After all, as long as she had milk, he would be her father! 

Wen Keke was not one to be easily intimidated. 

Ji He didn’t disappoint her. After finishing the noodles, he took out a yellow vial from his space ring and placed it on the table. “Temperature Adaptation Potion—it allows you to adapt permanently to any temperature.” 

Wen Keke’s eyes sparkled. So he had a space too! She looked at the yellow potion intently and suppressed the urge to snatch it, asking, “Can it be used for pets?” 

She wasn’t too worried about herself in the cold, but what about Jinbao? Even in the cold weather, it was manageable, but how would Jinbao cope with extreme heat? 

If it could be used for pets, then Jinbao wouldn’t have to fear the heat anymore! 

Ji He sipped his soup, “Yes.” 

Wen Keke smiled brightly and leaned closer, saying, “Mr. Ji, what would you like to eat for lunch? I’ll make arrangements!” 

Ji He pondered for a moment before pulling out a pot of hot pot from his space ring, pointing at the soup and declaring, “This.” 

Wen Keke’s mouth twitched, and after a brief pause, she replied, “Okay… Mr. Ji!” 

She hadn’t expected someone who seemed so grand and aloof to enjoy hot pot so much. The sight of him pulling it out from his space made her want to laugh but she held it back. 

Seeing Ji He wasn’t leaving, she blinked and asked, “Mr. Ji, you… aren’t going back?” 

Surely he wouldn’t stay until lunchtime, right? 

Ji He’s eyes flickered, and he revealed two red vials from his space ring, pushing them toward her as he explained, “Stimulation Potion—maximizes your existing physical potential tenfold.” 

This time, Wen Keke didn’t grab it right away. With her arms crossed, she looked at Ji He and feigned ignorance, saying, “What does this mean, Mr. Ji? Is this payment for dinner?” 

She blinked her eyes. 

Ji He remained calm and collected at the table, responding, “Dinner plus accommodation fee.” 

Wen Keke elongated her response, “Oh~” 

Afterward, she swiftly picked up the potions and asked cheerfully, “What does stimulating potential mean?” 

While she was already quite strong, things that could enhance her strength were still very much needed! 

Ji He glanced at her with mild disdain, as if asking if she didn’t know even this. 

“If your current potential is ten, drinking the potion will maximize it to one hundred.” 

Wen Keke understood and quietly stored all the potions she received today into her space. Hehe! Tomorrow, she would have double the potions! 

Wen Keke rubbed her hands together, filled with eagerness. 

Putting on her signature smile, she said, “Alright, Mr. Ji! I will arrange your accommodation right away, but as for the room fee, I won’t charge you much. You can stay for a week with today’s potions.” 

Wen Keke felt the potions were too precious. If the room cost was one vial per night, it felt like taking advantage of him. Besides, she didn’t have anything this beautiful gentleman would covet, so he could stay. 

After saying that, Wen Keke went downstairs. Earlier, she dismantled the training room on the first floor, and now she could convert it into a guest room. 

She chose the rightmost room, which had a separate bathroom. A large bed with a cashmere blanket and a down comforter was placed in the center. 

Noticing Ji He was dressed lightly, she assumed he didn’t fear the cold and only put a single blanket on the bed. 

She carpeted the floor and added a big table and chairs beside it for Ji He’s belongings. Next to the bed, she placed a wardrobe to accommodate his clothes since he was so good-looking—he must have plenty of outfits. 

Wen Keke was more than willing to provide some convenience for someone attractive. 

After placing some decorations, everything looked perfect except for the extreme cold. 

Wen Keke clapped her hands in satisfaction. 

Heading upstairs, she approached Ji He, who was still sitting at the dining table. “Mr. Ji, your room is ready! It’s just downstairs; please follow me.” 

Ji He stood up obediently and followed her downstairs. If the people from Central Star saw him behaving this way one day, they would likely drop their jaws in shock. 

Of course, Ji He’s thoughts were: The food is delicious; I can’t kill the cook. 

After showing Ji He to the guest room, Wen Keke went back upstairs and suddenly thought of installing a door at the stairwell. She didn’t know why, but she felt that more people would stay here in the future. 

She decided to act on it. Wen Keke took out a security door from her space, along with screws, a power drill, and other tools, working for about an hour. Just as Ji He was disturbed by all the noise, she finally finished. 

She smiled apologetically at Ji He and dashed back to her room. 

Once back in her bedroom, Wen Keke locked the door and threw herself onto the bed, laughing, “Hehe! I’m going to be rich!!!” 

She caught sight of Jinbao and scooped him into her arms, rubbing him, “Waaah, Jinbao! Sister is going to be rich!” 

“Meow~” Jinbao wriggled in protest. 

Thinking about the replication feature in her space, Wen Keke was practically floating with joy. 

She absolutely loved her space!!! 

After celebrating for a while, Wen Keke straightened her expression and thought of an idea. 

She wanted to open an apocalypse hotel! 

Today’s encounter with Ji He had inspired her. With her space filled to the brim with supplies, she worried it might someday overflow. Out of patriotism, she also wanted to help her country within her means. 

By opening a hotel, the country would take notice of her over time, and then she could engage in trade without needing to be suspiciously in front of them anymore. 

Moreover, a hotel would help many people. With her high combat strength and Ji He’s potions in her space, along with the weapons bought before the apocalypse, she didn’t fear anyone causing trouble. 

As for the guests, Wen Keke planned to be opportunistic. Based on her memories of the floods from her past life, many would escape to her mountain villa, promising a steady flow of guests. 

Regarding the conditions for staying, Wen Keke stroked her chin, deciding it would vary from person to person, but military personnel would be prioritized! 

After all, she currently lacked nothing. However, she still wanted to set some terms—preferably something that made others feel the pain of giving up but could still be offered, otherwise everyone would think she was a pushover. 

Looks like there were things to do next. 

Wen Keke got inexplicably excited. She had been bored for too long; finally, she had something to do!
