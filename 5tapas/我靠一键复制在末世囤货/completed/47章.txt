**The Enchanting Atmosphere**

Jasper leaned back in his chair, sipping on his cola, yet his gaze unconsciously drifted towards Candy. He couldn't quite understand why, but at that moment, she seemed to radiate a special glow.

Dappled lights reflected off Candy's hair, her slightly rosy cheeks from the mild intoxication gave her face a charming hue. Her eyes sparkled, and remnants of drink glistened on her lips.

In a spontaneous burst of energy, Candy stood up, holding her drink in one hand while playfully pretending to adjust her skirt with the other, dancing to the lively music that filled the air.

Her smile widened, and laughter erupted from her as she spotted their friends nearby. She twirled around and kneeled beside Jasmine, inviting her to join in.

Jasmine, clearly tipsy, wore a more cheerful expression than usual, her smile reaching her eyes as she returned Candy's inviting gesture. With a gentle laugh, she placed her hand atop Candy's and mimicked the way Candy lifted her skirt, gracefully accepting the invitation.

In the starry night, amidst the barbecue aromas and greenery, the attractive soldier and the lively girl danced together, merging elegance with spirited charm.

Their laughter illuminated the entire scene. Tamsin, clad in a flowing black dress, lounged in a nearby chair, sipping her drink, her eyes glimmering with delight as she watched the two dance below.

Daniel leaned against a nearby tree with a red cocktail in hand, raising it to his eye level, the ruby liquid allowing him to peer into the central spectacle of Candy dancing with Jasmine.

"How delightful... I'm feeling unusually stirred up~" 

Jasper felt a rare sense of relaxation, nestled in his chair as he fixated on Candy. Unbeknownst to him, a smile and a tenderness flickered in his eyes, his fingers tapping lightly on the table in rhythm with the music.

This feeling was indeed extraordinary.

Suddenly, Candy turned towards Jasper, grasping his hand as he tapped the table. Startled, he was pulled up by her gentle force, swaying to her rhythm.

It wasn't the graceful waltz nor the exhilarating jazz; it was simply a carefree movement, a natural flow.

Jasper had no dancing skills, but he mimicked Candy’s movements, the pair, a contrast of heights, with their long hair intertwining under the twinkling stars, their exquisite features resembling ethereal beings beneath the moonlight.

The moon appeared, peeking shyly from behind the clouds, its silver glow enveloping Jasper and Candy as they danced, lending them an otherworldly shimmer.

Candy gazed into Jasper's eyes, which sparkled under the moonlight, her own reflection captured in his pupils. As dizziness washed over her, she thought, 'Could it be that I’m really drunk? Why does Jasper seem so enchanting?'

Meanwhile, Tamsin glanced at the two with an enigmatic smile before rising to step outside for some fresh air.

In the tranquil snow-laden forest, the hem of her black dress trailed across the snow, leaving trails in its wake as she wandered aimlessly.

She looked up; the moonlight was bright. Leaning against a tree, Tamsin retrieved the cocktail she had secretly swiped earlier, taking a few soft sips while admiring the pale moon.

"Ah Yu."

Emerging from behind a tree was a silver-haired man in a blue robe, a red mark on his forehead accentuated by the moon's glow. Merlin looked at Tamsin with clear, bright eyes.

Tamsin didn't turn to him, still gazing at the moon and lightly brushing her hair aside, her red lips parting:

"Merlin, why are you here on Blue Star?"

Merlin stepped closer, blocking her view of the moon. Tamsin frowned slightly, tilting her head.

"Ah Yu, what do you think?"

Merlin's fingers brushed a strand of Tamsin's hair, their foreheads marked with symbols that glimmered softly, the contrast between his white hair and her gently curled dark hair suggesting a connection that felt both intertwined and nostalgic.

The warmth of the drink she had consumed was beginning to rise, giving Tamsin's enchanting face a hint of blush, enhancing her allure.

Merlin looked at her, an expression of admiration mixed with a possessive longing he hadn't realized he felt.

"Me? I think... you’re here… for me?"

“Haha, I’m just tired.”

Tamsin gently lifted Merlin's chin, leaning closer to whisper into his ear. As her voice trailed off, the tone softened, and she turned to walk back towards the villa.

Merlin stood still, clutching his left hand tightly. The hem of Tamsin's dress had just brushed against his fingers, and he raised his hand to his nose, inhaling the lingering scent as he murmured:

"Ah Yu... Ah Yu..."

The next morning, Candy stirred awake with a throbbing head, recalling the previous night's escapades. Jinbao, her cat, nuzzled against her, coaxing her to wake up with a soft "Meow~"

Candy hugged Jinbao tightly as her memory jogged back to the night's events.

They started with barbecues, followed by drinks concocted by Daniel, then... she seemed to have danced with Jasmine... and Jasper!

Oh my goodness!

She actually pulled Jasper into dancing!!!

Candy's eyes widened, her hands frantically messily combing through her hair.

This couldn't be real!

How could she hold Jasper while dancing! And with such a lustful gaze!

In her mind, Jasper had always been a hard-to-approach eccentric, a big-shot gourmand with deep pockets; in her heart, she had always viewed him as a mysterious figure.

She had respected Jasper like an elder!

Ahhhhhh!!!

Feeling utterly humiliated, Candy buried her face in her blanket and silently screamed.

“Knock knock—”

A knock echoed at her door, making Candy wonder who would come at such an hour.

Throwing on a long padded coat, she shuffled to the door:

“Who is it?”

“Click—”

The door swung open, revealing Jasper standing there with a bowl of congee in one hand, the other just setting down.

“Are you busy?”

Candy noticed Jasper's hand holding the congee, her face heating up in embarrassment. She had just been thinking about him, yet here he was delivering breakfast.

"I brought you congee. It’s already one o'clock."

A smile danced in Jasper's eyes as he gazed at Candy's disheveled hair and the hastily wrapped coat, looking like a little squirrel.

"Thank you so much! I completely lost track of the time."

Candy took the bowl from Jasper’s hand, realizing she had slept till one in the afternoon, feeling a mix of embarrassment and gratitude.

"Yeah." Jasper couldn’t help but reach out to ruffle her messy hair, chuckling as he turned to leave.

He feared that if he stayed any longer, the tension would break.

Candy stood frozen, her cheeks feeling as though they would explode. Why was the atmosphere so strange? 

Had Jasper gone mad?

How could he touch her hair?

And he was laughing!

“Bang—”

The door slammed shut with Candy's hasty movement. She placed the congee on her desk and flopped back onto her bed, burying herself under the covers once again.
