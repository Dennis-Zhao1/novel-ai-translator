We’re Back

“Your Highness, the Envoy from the Execution Hall has come to visit.”

At that moment, Wei Feng’s voice came from outside.

Taishu Ji Yu paused for a moment before quickly regaining her composure. 
“Little Kitty, I have to go attend to some matters. I’ll have Wei Feng take you to your room.”

Wen Keke nodded. “Okay, Sister Ji.”

As soon as she returned to her room, Wen Keke was pounced on by Jinbao. Perhaps due to the new environment, Jinbao was particularly clingy. 

“Meow~” 

Wen Keke stroked Jinbao’s head and gave it a kiss. “Oh, Jinbao is such a good boy! Sister loves Jinbao the most!”

Meanwhile, the gentleman lay on the table, pretending to be asleep, but the occasional sideways glance betrayed that he was fully awake.

“Gentleman is also very good!” 

Taking the opportunity, Wen Keke reached out to pet the gentleman’s head. It wasn’t often she got to touch him, as he was usually elusive.

On the other side, Taishu Ji Yu looked at the approaching Mu Qingrang, her expression unwavering. “Why aren’t you at your Prophecy Hall? What are you doing here?”

Mu Qingrang maintained his icy demeanor, but his gaze softened as he looked at Taishu Ji Yu. “I heard you’ve returned, so I came to see.”

Taishu Ji Yu paused, her expression neutral. “You’ve seen what you wanted. Now you can go back.”

However, Mu Qingrang didn't leave and instead sat down. Taishu Ji Yu scanned him with an inquiring gaze.

“I brought you a gift; you should like it.” 

Mu Qingrang smiled, and just then, the voices of the guards could be heard outside. “Envoy, the people have arrived.”

Taishu Ji Yu glanced outside, puzzled.

She saw two men dressed in black, pulling a rope attached to two individuals behind them. 

As she looked over, she realized it was the long-unseen Si Kou Yu and Si Kou Zhen.

Taishu Ji Yu’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Oh, isn’t that the Grand Elder and the Third Elder?”

The Grand and Third Elders glared furiously at Mu Qingrang in front of them.

“Mu Qingrang! Let me go!” 

Si Kou Zhen shouted through gritted teeth. Never had he thought he would be treated this way as the Grand Elder of the Council.

Just then, Ji He entered. Upon seeing the bound pair, he didn’t bat an eye; he exchanged a glance with Mu Qingrang, and some unspoken understanding passed between them.

“It’s up to you,” Mu Qingrang said to Ji He.

Taishu Ji Yu, sitting in the main seat, looked curiously at the two. What was happening? How had a madman gotten involved with Mu Qingrang?

After Mu Qingrang spoke, he took the puzzled Taishu Ji Yu and left, leaving behind the two howling men and the calm Ji He.

After a while, Ji He finally emerged, cleaning the blood off his hands, and murmured to the nearby guards: “Clean up.”

“Yes!”

Following that, Ji He walked towards Wen Keke’s room.

In the distance, Taishu Ji Yu furiously shook off Mu Qingrang’s hand. 

“What are you doing? What’s going on between you and Ji He?” 

Mu Qingrang smiled. “Are you concerned for me?”

Taishu Ji Yu frowned. When did Mu Qingrang become so thick-skinned?

“You!”

Mu Qingrang continued, “I just wanted to tell you that the Council will cease to exist from now on.”

Taishu Ji Yu was shocked. “How could that be? Don’t they still have the perfect serum?”

Mu Qingrang replied, “That was just a ruse.”

It turned out that the perfect serum, which the Council had always believed in, was a facade. They had been collaborating with a mysterious figure from the Prophecy Hall, while Mu Qingrang had been pretending all along, gradually eroding the Council’s power. Everything the Council had done over the years was orchestrated by Mu Qingrang, who they naïvely believed.

“What about the Blue Star?” 

“I used the Time Device. That girl’s parents should be seeing her around now.”

Meanwhile, Wen Keke looked shocked as she faced the two people before her.

“Dad… Mom!” 

Wen Keke covered her mouth, staring in disbelief.

Outside the room, Ji He silently watched.

Meanwhile, Wen Jinshu and Taishu Wanching looked at Wen Keke with gentle expressions.

“Sweetheart, we’re back.”

**The End.**
