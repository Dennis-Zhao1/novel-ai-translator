Title: The Dawn of a New Era

"Oh no! The troublesome apocalypse is gone?" 

After arriving at the Zhao residence, the flames had extinguished, leaving behind a blanket of ash and darkness. 

Wendy, having retracted the targeted weapon, had Starfall modify it before leading her team to the Zhao family's warehouses. 

Next to her, General Wade had yet to close his mouth since he witnessed Wendy taking out the weapon and blasting the Zhao villa. Miss Wendy was truly… unexpected! 

After all, anyone from the Dawn Base would spin conspiracy theories, guessing and second-guessing each other's motives, wasting precious time on the actual task of taking down the enemy. 

But Miss Wendy? Without saying a word, she fired a shot, and just like that, it was done! 

The team rummaged through the warehouses, clearing out everything — after all, who could ever have too much stuff? 

Once Wendy finished searching, Starfall announced that the weapon modification was complete. 

"Master, the modification is finished. Shall we use it now?" 

Starfall's voice rang out as Wendy looked toward the flood ahead and replied solemnly, "Let’s do it." 

An apocalypse like this should not exist. 

"Understood, Master!" 

Upon hearing her response, Starfall activated the newly modified weapon. 

At that moment, Wendy felt the ground beneath her tremble lightly, and a low hum echoed from the sky. 

Suddenly, four blue pillars of light shot up into the heavens from the four corners, creating a blue barrier above. 

Wendy knew that this was the controller that the Sikou family had given to the Zhao family; it was also the reason behind the apocalypse. 

As Wendy remained lost in her thoughts, she noticed a golden blade-like silhouette appear above the blue barrier, its tip aimed directly at the barrier's center. 

That was the weapon — The Annihilator — developed by Starfall to destroy the control mechanism. 

Alright, such a dramatic name was entirely Starfall's idea. 

Now, it seemed like all the people on Blue Star were suddenly aware of something, looking up at those two colors in the sky. 

At the Dawn Base. 

"Brother, what…?" 

David Youguo turned to his brother David Youshan, uncertainty written all over his face. What was happening? He had never seen anything like this before; it exceeded his comprehension. 

David Youshan gazed intently at the two colors overhead and said gravely, "It's the controller." 

David Youguo's eyes widened in disbelief. "The controller! That!!!" 

Shock and excitement erupted in David Youguo's eyes as he turned to David Youshan. 

The controller! The one responsible for this apocalypse! 

David Youguo looked up again at the blue barrier and the golden blade directed at it. 

Given this situation, it was evident they were about to destroy the controller! It had to be Miss Wendy! Who else could accomplish such a feat? 

"Brother! Is it true? Is it really Miss Wendy? What is she doing?" 

David Youguo's voice trembled. 

David Youshan’s head, which had been raised, remained up, his eyes slightly misty as he sighed, "Indeed, the younger generation is surging ahead. It's their time now." 

The tasks they could not accomplish relied entirely on the youth. Thankfully, their country still had these young individuals! 

On an unknown little hill in the distance, the remaining survivors gazed up at the magnificent spectacle. 

"Brother! Look! What is that?" 

A ragged girl, disheveled and dirty, stared up at the sky and asked her sibling beside her. 

The boy initially ignored his sister, used to her dramatic outbursts. 

"Xiaonan, if you don't come over now, there'll be nothing to eat today." 

He and his sister had miraculously washed up on this hill when the flood arrived, somehow managing to survive. 

Seeing her brother unmoved, the girl rushed over and cupped his head with her hands, forcing him to look up. 

"Brother! Look! There really is something!" 

Forced to look up, the boy remained calm until he saw the blue barrier and golden blade in the sky, jolting in surprise. 

"What is that?" 

At the military base in D City. 

"Sir! What is that?" 

Henry Wu exclaimed, staring at the sky as he addressed Lin Xiongan, who was still busy distributing supplies. 

At Henry’s words, Lin Xiongan lifted his gaze toward the window. 

Suddenly, he felt a jolt, sprang to his feet, and walked to the window, murmuring, "The controller! It’s the controller!" 

The controller had actually appeared! And what was that golden blade? It looked like it was preparing to destroy the controller. Was the headquarters finally making a move? 

Was the apocalypse truly about to end? 

Wendy furrowed her brows, watching the golden blade in the sky, sensing it needed more energy; indeed, time had been too tight… 

Beside her, Jia He glanced up at the sky and then turned to Wendy, taking her slightly damp hand in his. 

Wendy felt something pressed into her palm. Huh? A spatial ring? What was Ah He giving her at this moment? 

"Take a look?" 

Jia He gently suggested to her. 

Wendy, at his prompting, opened the spatial ring. 

"What?!" 

Wendy's eyes widened as she looked at Jia He, then back at the spatial ring. 

"How do you have so many Magma Stones?" 

Jia He patted Wendy on the head and smiled, "Did you forget something?" 

Wendy furrowed her brows in confusion, What had she forgotten? 

Unable to contain his laughter, Jia He made a fist and knocked it lightly against his lips. 

"You forgot that your space can directly store Magma Stones? If you were short on them, why not just go collect some?" 

He had that question because he knew what she intended to do with the Magma Stones. She could collect them directly, filling her storage without any issues, yet she insisted on finding a way to earn more as if it were a game. 

Of course, he would never admit out loud that Wendy was a bit silly. (Although he found her sweetness quite endearing.) 

Wendy’s eyes went wide. Right!!! 

Oh wow!!! 

I could just go and collect them directly! What was I worried about concerning the lack of Magma Stones? I could just fill my storage, then use the space's replication feature to have endless supplies! 

What was I thinking? 

Wendy smacked her forehead, feeling frustrated with herself. 

Danyan Ji Yu, observing this, chuckled, "Little kitty, don't slap your head anymore! If you do, Starfall's energy will run out!" 

Wendy snapped back to reality. Right, she still had to solve Starfall's energy problem, so she quickly handed over the Magma Stones from Jia He’s spatial ring to Starfall. 

With the replenishment of Magma Stones, the balance between the blue and golden colors in the sky shifted, with the golden light shining brilliantly, rushing towards the previously struggling blue barrier. 

The world fell silent. 

In this silence, the blue barrier shattered. 

No sound, no commotion; it simply broke apart. 

As it shattered, the blue fragments drifted away with the wind, performing a silent, mimed act before the show concluded. 

The golden blade also gradually faded, and with the disappearance of these two beams of light, so did the bothersome apocalypse…
