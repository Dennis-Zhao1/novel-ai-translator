**"Wow, biological sciences are amazing!"**

The leader exclaimed loudly, "I am Qingyun Hu! If you want to kill me, just make it quick!"

Wen Keke smiled brightly, "Why would I kill you? Can you build a flood control dam?"

Qingyun Hu, who had previously closed his eyes, opened them again, puzzled. "I can. Why? Are you planning to build a flood control dam?"

In this apocalyptic world, where food and clothing were scarce, it was strange that someone would have time to think about flood control.

Wen Keke grinned playfully, "Yes! I want to build a flood control dam. Haven't you thought about what would happen when the weather warms up and it gets hot?"

Hu nonchalantly replied, "Why should I care about that? I can hardly find enough to eat each day; surviving is my main concern!"

Wen Keke paused, realizing that not everyone was as carefree as she was. She had grown accustomed to a comfortable life lately and had forgotten how she had lived in her previous life.

She adjusted her demeanor and said, "I’m sorry, I took that for granted! I’d like to request your help in building it, with all meals and lodging covered!"

Qingyun Hu’s casual demeanor instantly changed, and he nearly jumped with excitement. "Are you serious? Meals and lodging included?"

Wen Keke nodded sincerely, "Of course!"

Hu scratched the back of his head, suddenly getting shy. "Can I bring them along?" He pointed back at a group of his students.

Fearing that Wen Keke might refuse, he hurriedly added, "They are all students in hydraulic engineering! I’m their teacher! We’re all from S University. They can help, and I can’t do it alone!"

Wen Keke nodded, "Of course! Let’s go now!"

Hu shouted again, "Wait… wait a minute." 

Seeming to realize he was being a bother, he added, "We have a few more students; can we bring them too? They are from other majors but can help!"

At that moment, Wen Keke admired this teacher for caring about his students even in an apocalypse; he was indeed a good mentor.

Wen gestured for Hu and his group to lead the way. Among a group of ragged-looking individuals, three well-dressed people blended surprisingly well together.

Wen Keke didn’t mind their shabby clothing. After all, surviving in an apocalypse was already a significant achievement; who cared about appearances? In her previous life, she had been even worse off.

What surprised her was that Tai Shu Jiyu and Ji He weren’t turned off by their appearance and walked calmly among them.

As they walked, a group of about ten people suddenly appeared ahead.

In sharp contrast to Hu's group, this new group had ruddy complexions and strong builds, seemingly unbothered by the apocalypse's hardships.

One scarred-faced man sneered at Hu, "Oh! Teacher Hu! What’s this? Starting to rob now? Didn’t you say you wouldn’t associate with the likes of us? Hahaha~"

Hu’s face reddened with embarrassment, unable to respond, as he had indeed claimed not to want to mix with these people before, yet here he was doing the very same thing.

The scarred man then noticed Wen Keke and her friends, his eyes lighting up. "Oh, two beauties!"

Seeing the way the man looked at Wen Keke made Hu silently mourn for him. She was indeed dangerous.

Although he knew Wen Keke was powerful, seeing her as a cute little girl, Hu instinctively stepped in front of her. "Step aside; don’t block our way. We're not easy to mess with!"

The students behind Hu gripped their knives, glaring fiercely at the group opposite them.

Before, the scarred man would have stepped aside; although their group had better food than Hu's, they were vastly outnumbered.

However, news had reached them that Hu's group hadn’t eaten for a day or two and were weakened. If they didn’t strike now, when would they?

The scarred man exchanged glances with his cohort and nodded, signaling them to attack.

One of his group members charged forward with a knife while the scarred man approached Wen Keke, reaching out to touch her face.

She cheerfully looked at him and said, "Goodbye!"

Before the man could understand why she said that, Starfall transformed into a laser cannon and fired at the scarred man and his crew.

"Boom—"

Smoke filled the air, causing Hu and the others to cough.

As the smoke cleared, the ground was littered with debris; the scarred man was utterly lifeless, and the others were no better.

Hu couldn’t help but shiver; if Wen Keke had fired at him like that…

Wen Keke whistled lightly, "Swoosh~ Oh! I wonder if beautiful people are always prickly?"

She hadn’t intended to blast them, but she was curious about what made them look so robust in the apocalypse. Thus, she had Starfall analyze them.

To her surprise, it turned out they were eating nothing but "two-legged lambs"!

The apocalypse had just begun, and resources weren't as scarce as they were later. The fact that they were already consuming other humans showed they had no moral compass.

Simply unworthy of being called human!

Realizing that, Wen Keke decided to use the cannon.

She smiled and told Hu and his group, “Let’s go! No one will stop us now.”

Hu awkwardly chuckled, "Okay! Follow me!"

He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. Goodness, this little girl looked like a doll, but who knew she could be so… ruthless? Truly, people couldn’t be judged by their appearances.

The students behind Hu also shivered slightly.

However, Hu understood; in an apocalypse, you had to be ruthless to survive.

The group traveled without encountering further incidents and reached the school peacefully.

"Teacher Hu!"

"Teacher Hu is back!"

Before Wen Keke and her friends could enter, a group of female students shouted from the windows.

Hu’s expression grew serious, and he pretended to be fierce. "What are you shouting about? Don’t you want everyone to know there are people here?"

The group of girls quieted down.

Once Wen Keke and her friends entered, they found themselves in the school's auditorium, which was almost entirely filled with female students, with a few male students looking unwell, about four to five hundred in total.

Everyone was dressed in the thickest clothes; perhaps because the weather had recently improved a bit, they were bundled up to a normal thickness, albeit a bit gray.

Fires crackled throughout the auditorium, with everyone huddled around the flames.

When they saw Hu return, excitement flashed in their eyes, and some even cried, relieved that Teacher Hu had come back safely.

They knew that every time Hu took some boys outside, it was a near-death experience. It was so cold and dangerous outside; they wanted to go too, but Hu always sternly told them that with their frail bodies, they couldn’t do anything and would just drag him down.

So, they could only do their best to make the auditorium warmer and cook tastier meals, saving whatever food they could to ensure Hu and his group returned full.

Every time Teacher Hu came back, they were overjoyed.

Seeing Wen Keke and her companions among Hu’s group brought astonishment to the students' faces. One was stunningly beautiful, another was delicately cute, and the only boy looked regal and elegant.

Hu stood in the center of the auditorium and shouted, “All students, line up by major!”

Although the students were confused, they complied and lined up obediently, with the hydraulic engineering boys holding in their excitement.

Once everyone was in line, Hu nodded with satisfaction, rubbed his hands together, and anxiously pointed at the students as he addressed Wen Keke. “This row is for Traditional Chinese Medicine, this row is for Tourism, and this row is for Geography…”

The students represented nearly all majors, and Wen Keke's eyes lit up even more.

Hu then guided an elderly gentleman in his sixties towards Wen Keke. “This is our school’s vice-principal, who specializes in biological sciences.”

Wen Keke’s eyes sparkled even brighter! Biological sciences are fantastic!

Although her space could store vegetables and meat, they were all dead. If she could cultivate and raise living things, wouldn’t that be much better?
