**On a Rainy Day, Who Are You Waiting For? (4)**

That night, Emma Wen and Henry Ji finished reviewing the files of the three victims at the convenience store. They discovered that Victim One, Sophie Yun, had a close relationship with psychologist David Lin. David was Sophie’s dessert teacher, and the two exchanged messages frequently on their phones. However, the police had no evidence to arrest David, as he had a solid alibi for the night Sophie was murdered.

Victim Two, Lily Pan, was an introverted student who mostly studied at home and had no other hobbies or social life. Her family favored boys over girls. Victim Three, Ashley Xin, was well-adjusted socially and was a hardworking young girl. Apart from Sophie’s connection to David, the other two victims had no direct ties to him.

Seated in the classroom, Emma pondered; it was already the following day. She had returned around five in the morning, lay down for a bit, then headed straight to class. Oh, and Henry was also in the same school, in her grade but a different class.

“Hey, Emma! Someone’s looking for you!” a classmate called out from the doorway. Emma looked up and saw Henry standing outside.

Emma got up and walked out. “What are you doing here?”

Henry handed her a piece of paper. “I found out that Victim One, Sophie Yun, and Victim Three, Ashley Xin, are half-sisters with the same father.”

Emma was surprised and took the paper to read, discovering that Sophie was indeed Ashley’s sister—a fact that was hard to tell from their photos. One looked delicate and plain, working at a convenience store, while the other was a third-year music student, dressed elegantly and living lavishly.

They were part of the same family?

Emma glanced back at the documents and learned that Sophie’s father, Jonathan Yun, had initially married Sophie’s mother but divorced when Sophie was three. He later remarried to Ashley’s mother. Sophie’s mother then married her current husband, with whom she had a son, Sophie’s younger brother. The two sisters must have known about each other.

Emma noticed that some classmates were watching her and Henry in the classroom, so she bid farewell to Henry and arranged to meet at the small grove during lunch.

“Hey, Emma, do you know Simon Xie? I saw him delivering something to you!” a classmate asked as Emma returned to her seat.

Emma smiled shyly. “We met by chance; it was just study materials.” 

Seeing Emma’s reluctance to discuss it further, the classmate stopped asking.

At noon, Emma and Henry met in the small grove. Just as Emma was about to pull out the information she had gathered, she spotted class representative Clara Wen walking down the path, carrying something alone.

“Let’s hide!” Emma pulled Henry behind a tree, glancing at Clara’s direction. 

That way was… the psychology consultation room!

Was Clara going to see David?

Emma exchanged glances with Henry, who understood immediately as they began to follow Clara.

Once Clara entered the consultation room, Emma quickly assessed the location and surroundings. Pulling Henry along, she dashed to a corresponding classroom in the opposite building, where she retrieved binoculars and set up her lip-reading translator.

“Just a little something for fun~” Emma chuckled, not initially planning to use her supplies but realizing she had underestimated her own ingenuity.

Henry simply smiled, his eyes filled with indulgence as he watched Emma.

Using the binoculars, Emma looked across to see Clara entering the consultation room, a cake box in hand. With a shy expression, she placed the box on David’s desk.

“Dr. Lin, I heard you like cakes from this shop, so I specifically bought this for you,” Clara said bashfully.

David adjusted his glasses and smiled warmly, “Oh, Clara! You didn’t have to go through all this trouble. Your main task now is to focus on your studies.”

Picking up on David’s subtle refusal, Clara’s eyes dimmed a bit, yet she placed the cake down and hurriedly replied, “Well, I already bought it, so I’ll just leave it here! Bye, Dr. Lin!” 

With that, Clara shut the door behind her. Emma turned her attention to David, who glanced at the cake box, shook his head, and continued with his work.

Emma felt puzzled. From the looks of it, Clara had an unrequited crush on David? It was surprising, as Clara usually seemed so focused on her studies, often staying up late to work—even someone so dedicated could develop feelings for David? 

David’s demeanor remained perfectly normal. Emma tapped her chin thoughtfully.

With classes ending early on Friday, Emma and Henry planned to stroll near Lily Pan’s home since she had the least information available about her among the three victims.

Lily lived in a less affluent area, part of the urban village. The buildings had seen better days, and at each intersection, older ladies and gentlemen were chatting away.

Emma approached a group of elderly women with an innocent smile to gather information.

“Excuse me, do you know where Lily Pan’s family lives?” 

Lily had a family of five, including her father, Harry Pan, mother, Susan Zhang, younger sister, Amanda Pan, and younger brother, Ben Pan. Both parents worked as sanitation workers, relying on meager wages to support the family. After having two daughters, they cherished their only son as the apple of their eye. 

Lily and her younger sister had initially been barred from school, but Lily, resourceful as she was, had used bonuses from part-time jobs to fund their high school education. 

After Lily’s death, the family had pulled Amanda from school, leaving her to handle household chores. The aging grandmother sighed when she realized Emma was looking for Lily.

“You’re looking for Amanda, aren’t you?” 

Since Lily had passed, it felt inappropriate to say she was searching for her, so Emma instead inquired about Amanda. 

“Yes, we’re classmates of Lily. She mentioned her sister often. Since she's gone, we just wanted to check on how Amanda is doing,” Emma explained with a sorrowful expression.

The grandmother observed Emma’s glum demeanor and sighed, “Oh, Lily was such a good girl! It’s a pity… As for Amanda... those two heartless parents! You’ll find their house just down the alley to the left; it’s the second one. They’re not home right now, so go on.”

Having said that, the grandmother showed reluctance to continue the conversation.

Emma was perplexed; the grandmother’s tone suggested something was amiss with Amanda. 

With curiosity and Henry in tow, Emma approached the door of the house mentioned. 

The door was a rusty iron one, worn down with time. 

Emma knocked. 
“Knock, knock—”

Nobody answered after a few minutes, and as impatience grew, she knocked again. Just as she was about to give up, the door creaked open. 

“Creeeak—”
