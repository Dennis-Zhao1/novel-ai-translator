**Luminous Moonstone**

The old man looked puzzled. "Little Hu, what is this?"

Hu Qingyun smiled at the elder and said, "Principal Li, this is Miss Wen. She's planning to hire us to repair the flood dike, and she's covering our meals and accommodation!"

Upon hearing this, Principal Li trembled, raising his hand to grasp Hu Qingyun's hand, his eyes wide with disbelief. "Really? Little Hu, as a teacher, we can't be deceiving people!"

Hu Qingyun firmly held on to Principal Li's hand, "It's true! Just look at Miss Wen; does she seem like someone who would lie?"

Besides, there's nothing for us to be deceived about!

Wen Keke smiled brightly at Principal Li. "What Teacher Hu said is true! However, I promise it's not a free ride. You all need to work hard for me! Of course, if you want to keep living here, there will be some conditions attached."

Principal Li nodded enthusiastically. "That makes sense! Miss Wen, you clearly are someone who means business! We really have struck gold here!"

Seeing the once-respected elder now looking somewhat ingratiatingly at her, Wen Keke felt a mix of emotions that she couldn't suppress. 

Not wanting to dwell on this, Wen Keke instructed Hu Qingyun to help everyone pack their belongings and prepare to set off.

The other students became excited upon hearing what the water conservancy engineering students planned to do. Some of the girls even approached Wen Keke, blushing as they said, "This... this is for you, Miss Wen."

They offered her a chocolate bar, its edges slightly worn as if it had often been held in hand. In the apocalyptic world where food was rare, this chocolate was incredibly precious, capable of providing much-needed energy.

A warm feeling surged through Wen Keke for these lovely students.

Wen Keke took out a starship and eleven large interstellar buses made from meteorite material. Each bus could accommodate fifty passengers and did not require a driver, functioning entirely under the control of the meteorite technology.

Hu Qingyun and the others were astonished to see Wen Keke casually call forth more than ten vehicles. Could an ordinary person possess such capabilities?

In the apocalyptic world, they were accustomed to the extraordinary, and since they were students, they were quick to understand that this was simply part of someone else's world. No one approached Wen Keke with questions; they sat carefully in the vehicles, afraid of dirtying the seats.

Within minutes, Wen Keke brought over five hundred people back to the mountains where the villa was located—Qiju Mountain.

This area, once the most sought-after in S City, was well-maintained and distant from urban chaos, making it one of the most elite luxury residences before the apocalypse.

Xu Jin, hearing the commotion outside, stepped out to see dozens of vehicles arriving at the Warm Hotel entrance.

Since the apocalypse started, he had never seen so many people.

Xu Jin stood tall at the entrance of the hotel, his smile warm and inviting, presenting himself as a capable hotel manager.

Inside the vehicles, Hu Qingyun, Principal Li, and the students were silent in astonishment, their mouths agape as they gazed at the bright red characters spelling out "Warm Hotel."

The red lettering stood out dramatically against the white snow, and the tall building still loomed over the landscape, just as it did before the apocalypse. The crunch of snow beneath their feet snapped them back to reality.

Hu Qingyun, shocked, turned to Wen Keke and asked, "This... is this yours?"

Wen Keke nodded. "Of course!"

Principal Li eagerly pulled Hu Qingyun along, stepping forward with excitement. "Miss Wen, what are the conditions to stay here? Can we live inside?"

Still surprised by Principal Li's energy, Hu Qingyun quickly chimed in, "Yes, yes! Miss Wen! What do we need to do to stay here?"

The other students looked at Wen Keke with sparkling eyes.

Wen Keke calmly retrieved a large blackboard from nearby and hung it on the railing by the door. "Now, let's outline the accommodations!"

The eyes of Hu Qingyun and the others followed the movement of the blackboard eagerly.

**Accommodation Conditions:**
1. Exchange goods for accommodation; the greater the value of the goods, the longer the stay. The value will be determined by the owner.
2. Exchange labor for accommodation; provide a skill in return for lodging (e.g., cooking, etc.)
3. Use magma stones (which can be mined from volcanoes; tools can be borrowed from the owner), and various ores and metals can also be exchanged for lodging. A single magma stone provides ten days, and exchanges of other items will be assessed by the owner.
4. All conditions are subject to the owner's discretion.
5. The owner has absolute interpretative authority over all the conditions listed above.

Once the conditions were clear, Principal Li adjusted his glasses and turned to Wen Keke. "I'm curious what you consider valuable?"

Among the 150 students from the water conservancy program, the rest were from other fields and might not meet the specific conditions. It wouldn't be fair for them to stay here without contributing!

Wen Keke looked at Principal Li and the students behind him, responding, "Anything I like is valuable!"

Principal Li pondered, then reached into his inner pocket, pulling out a small cloth bag, resembling one of those lucky bags sold commercially. 

When he opened the bag, it revealed a small black box, about four inches wide and two inches tall, with a combination lock.

Wen Keke couldn't help but be curious about what treasure the vice-principal of S University was so keen to protect.

After inputting the code, the box opened with a soft click.

Inside lay a gray stone, looking no different from a rock picked up off the ground.

Principal Li handed the stone to Wen Keke, explaining, "This is from my younger days—a personal collection, a meteorite. I studied it and found no radiation, but when buried, plants in that soil grew rapidly, almost overnight, without regard for temperature. I hadn't finished my research before the apocalypse came..."

His voice trailed off with a sense of resignation.

“Analyzing, Starfall.”

“Received! Master,” the voice of Starfall responded cheerfully.

“Beep—scanning in progress! Analysis complete! 
Name: Luminous Moonstone 
Ability: Accelerates growth in all living organisms, including animals; it possesses immense vitality.”

Wen Keke's eyes widened—stimulating all life? Does this mean that with this stone, anything planted or cared for would thrive? 

Starfall chimed back joyfully: "Exactly, Master! That is indeed what it does! It's a unique stone from the Luminous Moon Galaxy! How it ended up on our Blue Star in the Ailan Galaxy is a mystery."
