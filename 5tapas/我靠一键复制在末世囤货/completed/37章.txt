**Earrings**  

As Wen KeKe discussed her plans with Xing Yun, Xing Yun suddenly interjected,  
“Master, there’s a woman dressed in military uniform from Huaguo, about twenty-one years old, parked by the roadside approximately five hundred meters outside the community.”  
Wen KeKe’s excited expression faltered for a moment, her hands tightening as she said, “Analyze!”  
Could it be the person she had been thinking of?  
“Beep—Analysis in progress.  
Analysis complete!  
Name: Jiao Jiao Lin  
Gender: Female  
Age: 21 years  
Occupation: Military Personnel”  
Wen KeKe's grip tightened even more, a flash of excitement in her eyes—it's her! She actually came to Qiju Mountain!  
Is it because she was worried about her?  
From a distance, Ji He noticed Wen KeKe’s eyes welling with tears and hurried over with an anxious expression.  
“What’s wrong? Did someone bully you?”  
Listening to Ji He speaking so much for the first time calmed Wen KeKe’s racing heart, and she smiled.  
“I’m fine. It’s just that an old friend I haven’t seen in a long time has arrived, and I’m a bit excited.”  
Seeing Wen KeKe’s smile, Ji He’s expression gradually relaxed, replying, “Oh.”  
Old friend? What kind of old friend could make her this emotionally overcome?  
Is it important?  
A hint of resentment flickered in Ji He’s heart; during their first meeting, Wen KeKe hadn’t even recognized him. If it weren’t for the promise made to that person to keep his identity secret, he would have already told Wen KeKe everything.  
Wen KeKe, oblivious to Ji He’s inner turmoil, directly steered her spaceship toward the military vehicle where Jiao Jiao was parked.  
Before long, Wen KeKe saw Jiao Jiao’s vehicle and stopped her spaceship. She got out from a distance and stood still, gazing in Jiao Jiao’s direction but hesitating to take a step closer.  
There stood Jiao Jiao leaning against the cab of the military truck, her army green pants accentuating her long legs with a unique sense of strength.  
The black belt hinted at a slim waist concealed beneath the uniform. She wore black military boots, enhancing her confident stance.  
Looking up, one could see her neat short hair framing a face that could be described as ambiguous—neither overly feminine nor masculine. Compared to the overly beautiful and seductive Tai Shushi Yu, Jiao Jiao seemed more like vines growing among thorns, intertwining and encroaching upon the senses, yet her passionate and resolute spirit couldn't be hidden.  
A single, light blue earring adorned one ear, contrasting sharply with her cool demeanor, adding a touch of girlish elegance.  
Wen KeKe spotted the same blue earring on Jiao Jiao’s ear, touching her own identical earring, her hands covering her face as her eyes reddened.  
She didn’t blame herself!  
She didn’t!  
——  
“Jiao Jiao! Look what I bought!”  
Middle school Wen KeKe eagerly looked at the short-haired Jiao Jiao, wanting her to guess what she had just purchased.  
“Did you finish your math homework?” Jiao Jiao asked, glancing at the shorter Wen KeKe.  
Wen KeKe pouted, “Jiao Jiao, can’t you just guess once~”  
Upon seeing Wen KeKe’s sulking expression, Jiao Jiao’s eyes sparkled with amusement, “Fine, let me guess—earrings?”  
Wen KeKe suddenly looked up, her almond-shaped eyes wide with surprise. “How did you know, Jiao Jiao?”  
Jiao Jiao pinched Wen KeKe's cheek, “Do you think I wouldn’t know what you wanted?”  
Wen KeKe nodded, realizing it was true; having grown up together, they both knew each other's preferences. Recently, she had become a little rebellious, favoring a punk style—she even dragged Jiao Jiao along to get their ears pierced.  
“Guess what! I bought two pairs that are identical! Ta-da!”  
Wen KeKe produced a pair of light blue earrings from her hand. Initially, she wanted to buy black, thinking they would be cooler, but remembering how cool Jiao Jiao already was, she opted for the gentler color to soften Jiao Jiao's edge.  
Wen KeKe handed one to Jiao Jiao, “Let’s wear them to school tomorrow! If we ever argue, we’ll take them off, and when we’re no longer mad, we’ll put them back on to show we’ve made up!”  
Although Jiao Jiao internally resisted Wen KeKe's childish idea, she nodded honestly.  
——  
Lost in her memories, Wen KeKe felt a flick on her forehead and blinked through her tears toward the person before her.  
Jiao Jiao had stepped away from the car and was now standing right in front of her.  
She sighed helplessly and ruffled Wen KeKe’s hair,  
“Why are you crying?”  
Wen KeKe choked back her sobs, “I thought you didn’t want to talk to me…”  
Jiao Jiao’s father, Lin Houde, was the martial arts teacher appointed by Wen KeKe’s parents since childhood, which is how she met Jiao Jiao.  
They grew up together, doing everything side by side. Influenced by her father, Jiao Jiao always dreamed of becoming a soldier, keeping short hair and often facing disdain among girls who loved frilly dresses.  
Wen KeKe just thought Jiao Jiao was really cool; she admired her from a young age, which forged a deep friendship between them.  
That incident happened on Wen KeKe’s birthday. Her parents and teacher were out of town, and she wanted them to come back to celebrate. So she called to urge them to return, not knowing that the flight they chose would meet with an accident.  
Wen KeKe harbored guilt towards Jiao Jiao, feeling she didn’t know how to face her afterward. She continually sent money to Jiao Jiao’s account each month, and even anonymously delivered supplies to Jiao Jiao’s family home and to her military housing, planning to send packages once in a while.  
Jiao Jiao gently rubbed Wen KeKe’s head: “You were the one too scared to see me. I went looking for you, and you avoided me.” Her tone carried a hint of grievance.  
Even her usually resolute eyes were glistening with tears; she could hardly hide the anger she felt at being ignored by Wen KeKe. She wanted to believe that Wen KeKe trusted her, and that had made her increasingly upset, leading her to stop actively seeking Wen KeKe.  
She knew all the supplies and money sent were from Wen KeKe, although she didn’t need them; she understood that resources were scarce after the apocalypse, intending to save everything to repay Wen KeKe later. She wasn’t lacking for food and drink in the army, but she didn’t want Wen KeKe to feel inconvenienced by her.  
Unable to bottle up her tears anymore, Wen KeKe's nose turned red, her lashes clumping together from the tears, making her look like a pitiful little bundle.  
Jiao Jiao looked at Wen KeKe’s tear-streaked face and couldn’t help but laugh, “You’re starting to look more and more like a squirrel.”  
Wen KeKe recalled some embarrassing moments from her past and burst into laughter, “No way! I’m a super-duper cute girl!”  
The two girls smiled at each other in the snowy landscape, breaking through the ice that had settled between them. The earrings glinted in the snow, illuminating a patch of pure land in their soft hearts.  
In the distance, Ji He watched the two—one tall in military uniform, the other short, their gazes locked on each other, a mixture of dependence and trust in Wen KeKe's eyes.  
Ji He felt a strange discomfort in his chest, unable to pinpoint why he felt this way. Turning for one last glance at the pair, he walked away…
