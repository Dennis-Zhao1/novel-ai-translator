**Jin Bao's "Gift"**

Wen Keke looked at the object that had scratched her hand. It was a ring, and by the material, it appeared to be jade. But how could jade have cut her skin?

As she picked up the ring, she found it smooth and cool to the touch; there were no sharp edges. After pondering for a moment, she decided to store the ring, along with everything else in the room, in her space. Thinking back to the man she had encountered earlier that day triggered a sense of urgency within her.

Previously, she had only wanted to survive the extreme cold and floods in her villa, but now the surroundings felt unsafe, and she didn't know when she might need to leave. It was wiser to keep things securely stored for now.

After taking one last look around the room, Wen Keke locked the door and went downstairs to continue her training.

**Central Star of the Ailan Star System.**

Tai Shu Jiyu gazed at the ring in her hands, her eyes flickering with excitement. Just moments ago, she had sensed the presence of her family’s bloodline.

Typically, she could only feel this connection during the birth of a new life, but ever since genetic issues had become more severe, no new lives had emerged from the Tai Shu family or even within the whole Ailan Star System. Yet, just now, she felt it!

Tai Shu Jiyu activated the ring to sense the location. Hmm? 

This place is... Blue Star?

Leaning back against her throne, Tai Shu Jiyu took a moment to ponder, stretching her lazy form before standing up. Her slim waist, partially concealed by black lace, swayed gently with the wind, and a smile graced her lips. 

"It seems I need to find that little one personally~" 

She prepared to teleport directly to Blue Star.

**On Blue Star.**

After finishing her training, Wen Keke began to prepare dinner for the day, deciding on claypot rice, crispy pork belly, and coconut chicken. She took out a small clay pot specifically for the rice and steamed it first. Then, she neatly arranged the sliced cured sausages and bacon on top of the rice, cracked an egg in the middle, and set it aside to steam.

Next, she brought out a piece of pork belly, cutting it into evenly sized squares without cutting it through completely. She brushed it with soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, chicken essence, five-spice powder, and barbecue powder, marinating the pork for over two hours.

Wrapping it tightly in foil with the skin side down, she poked holes into it with a fork, then sprinkled a light layer of salt on top, putting it in the oven at 180° for about two hours.

While the pork was roasting, she retrieved two coconuts from her space, opened them from the top, poured out the coconut water, and diced the coconut flesh. She then added some water, mushrooms, red dates, and coconut flesh to boil, adding the cleaned chicken pieces once it reached a boil. She skimmed off the foam and boiled it on high heat for another fifteen minutes.

Once the coconut chicken was ready, the crispy pork belly was also done. Wen Keke queued up a light-hearted comedy show and prepared a small fish for Jin Bao. After serving Jin Bao's meal, she placed her own dinner on the warming stove and began to eat while watching the show.

Outside the villa, Tai Shu Jiyu stepped out from her teleportation with bare feet on the snow, her long black dress and slightly wavy hair billowing in the cold breeze. The gems on her crown sparkled in the snow, giving her the appearance of a snow queen, unparalleled and independent, with the runes on her forehead flickering at an increasing frequency. 

"Is this the place? The little one from the family~" Tai Shu Jiyu whispered while gazing at Wen Keke’s villa.

Just as she was about to step inside, she suddenly turned her head, her expression turning cold: "Again with that madman."

With that said, she clutched the space button and left.

Ji He kicked the Third Elder, Si Kou Yu, away without holding back, using enough force to send him flying but not to kill him. He wiped his foot in the snow dismissively.

Ignoring the terrified gaze of the fallen man, Ji He locked his eyes fiercely on Si Kou Yu: 

"Go back and tell that group in the Council that this is a place I, Ji He, have my eyes set on."

The Third Elder, Si Kou Yu, trembled and stuttered in reply, "I... I'll be sure to tell..."

Ji He no longer looked at him, turning his gaze towards S City, his eyes narrowing slightly: "Why can't they ever learn?"

In the middle of a teleportation through the space button, Tai Shu Jiyu paused as a man blocked her path, her expression calm but her tightly clenched fists betraying her inner tension.

"What brings you to take an interest in Blue Star as well?" she asked.

Ji He looked coldly at her without answering.

"The royal family is still as intolerable as ever," Tai Shu Jiyu said, steadying her heart. Based on her understanding of the man opposite her, he wouldn't come attacking immediately unless there was further negotiation possible.

Tai Shu Jiyu flashed a polite smile, "Since this is a place you value, the royal family is willing to withdraw."

As she spoke, she began to step back. Noticing his inaction, she activated the space button to teleport back to Central Star. 

**Central Star.**

As soon as Tai Shu Jiyu returned to the palace, she summoned Wei Feng and handed him a circular object.

"Wei Feng, please go to Blue Star and bring back the Tai Shu family’s bloodline."

While she couldn’t go herself, the bloodline of the Tai Shu family must not remain in the backward Blue Star, especially now that Blue Star's plans were already in motion.

Wei Feng felt shocked internally but maintained a calm facade, replying, "Yes!"

Understanding the urgency of the matter, Wei Feng took the items and directly teleported away.

**On Blue Star.**

Ji He looked at S City, a look of disdain crossing his features. "What a hassle, this woman."

Unbeknownst to him, Wen Keke was blissfully munching on chicken wings, totally unaware she was being scorned.

Surveying the mess on the table, Wen Keke exclaimed in surprise, "Huh? When did my appetite get this big?"

She had finished all the claypot rice, coconut chicken, and crispy pork belly—soup clean too.

Feeling something was off, she stood up and headed down to the training room.

"Bang—" 

The sandbag exploded with one punch from Wen Keke.

Wen Keke stared, dumbfounded, at her hand, then at the broken sandbag.

Is this a superpower??? 

It has to be!!!

Wen Keke retrieved another sandbag from her space and tried again.

Sure enough, the sandbag burst again.

Excited, Wen Keke spun around, realizing that with this strength, her chances of survival had significantly increased!

Recalling that man from earlier, who had made her spit blood after one punch, his strength seemed roughly comparable to hers now…

Then she thought about his cool outfit—could it mean…

He’s a reborn as well? 

And has a space too?

The idea seemed increasingly plausible; her newfound strength was definitely connected to this space.

That man must have non-human powers and likely possesses something similar to a space.

Frowning, Wen Keke felt the situation had grown much more complicated this lifetime.

Feeling another wave of urgency, she immediately began training in the room.

"Meow!" A scratching sound came from the door.

Drenched in sweat, Wen Keke turned her head and recognized Jin Bao’s voice from outside. 

"Meow~"

Listening closely, it definitely was Jin Bao’s voice!

Wen Keke rushed to the door and opened it to find a small bundle of Jin Bao in the little clothes she had bought, squatting at the entrance, next to a black object. The little cat appeared incredibly cute.

Upon closer inspection, she noticed it was a dead mouse.

Wen Keke didn't have time to be surprised about how Jin Bao had gotten outside; she quickly picked him up and checked him over for any injuries.

Letting out a sigh of relief, she thought to give him a kiss, only to remember the mouse.

Wen Keke laughed lightly, tapping Jin Bao on the little head, "No need for you to hunt at home."

As she spoke, she dug a hole nearby and buried the mouse.

After carrying Jin Bao back inside, she pulled out a box of canned meat for him, pointing at the cans and saying, "Look, there’s still plenty of food! No need to worry about hunger."

Not sure if Jin Bao understood, he promptly pranced off to play with his ball.

Wen Keke watched with a smile as Jin Bao played; he must have seen her get hurt today and felt the urge to hunt to show he could also find food.

She couldn’t help but wonder how Jin Bao had gotten outside.
