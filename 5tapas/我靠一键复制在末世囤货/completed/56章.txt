**Chapter 1: Whispers of Care**

"Why do you care about me? Is it because of what my father left behind?"

Wen Keke gazed at the black box on the table and quietly stepped forward to open it. Inside was a video recorder. She felt her hands tremble slightly as she hovered over the box for a moment, unsure of what to do. Xu Jinlin, Jiao Jiao, and the others sensed that it was best to leave Wen Keke alone at this moment and quietly stepped outside. Before leaving, Jiao Jiao took Jinbao with her.

Wen Keke closed the box, carried it upstairs to her room, and sat down on the carpet before opening it again. She stared intently at the recorder inside.

"Papa... did you leave something behind?"

After hesitating for a while, Wen Keke finally decided to turn on the video recorder. The screen flickered to life, revealing a man who looked to be only in his thirties, next to a woman whose height barely reached the man's chest. The man had handsome features and a tall figure, while the woman was charming and cute, bearing a striking resemblance to Wen Keke—anyone could tell the two shared a blood relation.

"Dad... Mom..."

Tears streamed down Wen Keke's face as she looked at the two on the screen.

"Don’t cry, sweetheart!" The video image of Wen Jingshu seemed to sense Keke's tears and spoke cheerfully into the camera.

"My sweet baby, it should be New Year's Eve, right? I wonder how you’re doing... you must have suffered a lot, haven't you?"

Wen Jingshu's eyes glistened with concern, and beside him, Wen Mama, also known as Tai Shu Wanqing, looked at the screen with a heart full of empathy.

"Sweetheart, don’t cry~"

As she spoke, Wen Mama’s voice began to tremble, and soon tears streamed down her face as well.

Wen Jingshu wrapped his arms around Tai Shu Wanqing's waist and gently wiped her tears away, smiling as he said, "Look at you, why are you crying? Our sweetheart will be sad if she sees this!"

Though he wore a smile, the red around Wen Jingshu’s eyes betrayed his inner turmoil.

"Papa… Mama..." Wen Keke covered her mouth, tears blurring her vision. She quickly wiped her eyes, afraid she might miss something on the video.

"I'm sorry, sweetheart. We couldn't be by your side when you needed us most. Will you forgive us?"

"I’ll... I'll never forgive you!" Wen Keke choked out, her nose turning red from crying.

"Ah, I knew you'd say that. What should we do, dear?" Wen Jingshu pretended to be sorrowful, resting his head on Tai Shu Wanqing’s shoulder.

Tai Shu Wanqing pushed his head away, feigning annoyance. "Get off, you’re blocking my view of our sweetheart!"

Wen Jingshu acted aggrieved. "Is it that you don’t love me anymore? You only love our sweetheart!"

Tai Shu Wanqing shot him a sidelong glance, and Wen Jingshu quickly straightened up.

Wen Keke gazed at her parents' joyful banter, her tears turning into a smile. The sight was nostalgic, as if she were watching them as she once did.

"Oh! Our sweetheart is smiling!" On the screen, Wen Jingshu pointed out with a grin.

"Sweetheart, there's not much time left; Happy New Year! Remember, our family will be together again!" Wen Jingshu said with a cheeky expression.

Tai Shu Wanqing added sweetly, "Sweetheart, Happy New Year! I hope you have many happy days in the coming year!"

Together, they faced the camera one last time, saying, "Sweetheart, be happy! Mama and Papa are always with you!"

And then the screen went blank.

Wen Keke sat frozen, pondering the meaning of "our family will be together." Could it be... that her parents were still alive?

The thought ignited excitement within her—were they not gone after all? But where could she possibly search for them? As this realization dawned on her, her emotions dampened again; it seemed impossible to find them!

Tears slowly flowed down her cheeks again, and as she gripped the video recorder tighter, her nails turned red, as if she meant to cry out all her sorrows at once. Wen Keke allowed herself a moment of unrestrained grief in her room.

In the stairway, Ji He stood quietly, watching the door of Wen Keke’s room, the atmosphere heavy around him, like a statue guarding a princess.

With a creak, the door to Wen Keke's room opened. She caught sight of Ji He standing in the stairwell and curiously asked, "Ji He, what are you doing standing there?"

Her voice was hoarse—after all, she had just shed tears freely.

Ji He looked at Wen Keke, whose nose was red and eyes puffy, holding back his heartache as he masked his concern with a calm demeanor. "Are... are you okay?"

Ji He hesitated, relinquishing his usual strong facade. Here, in front of Wen Keke, he revealed a tender side.

"I'm fine!" Wen Keke reassured him with a frown, perplexed. She truly felt okay. After the tears, she felt lighter. Why would Ji He think something was wrong?

Wen Keke thought back to how loudly she had cried. “Ahem, I just... watched a video from my parents, and it made me a little sad.”

Her cheeks flushed slightly as she made a small gesture, feeling embarrassed about how loud she must have been.

Ji He looked deeply into Wen Keke's eyes, assuring himself she wasn't just putting on a brave face. He breathed a silent sigh of relief. "I’m glad to hear that."

With that, Ji He turned to head down the stairs.

But Wen Keke called out to him, halting his steps.

"Stop right there!"

Ji He paused, turning back with a puzzled expression. Wen Keke stepped closer to him, her eyes shining with admiration. Ji He wore the white coat she had picked out for him the day before. Normally clad in black, the white coat suited him, conveying an ethereal elegance.

His long hair flowing, with exquisite features, he appeared timeless, like an otherworldly being, far removed from the mundane.

In that moment, Ji He glanced back at Wen Keke, curious about what she wanted to say.

Wen Keke locked her gaze onto Ji He’s and asked, "Why do you care so much about me?"

Ji He was taken aback, but before he could answer, Wen Keke continued, listing her questions earnestly.

"Why did you bring me medicine when I had a cold? Why did you give me your exclusive starship? Why did you present me with the only shooting star? Why did you make porridge for me that morning? Why were you willing to dance with me? Why did you give me so many red crystals? Why do you accompany me everywhere I go? And now, why are you still standing here? Ji He, why?"

"Do you... do you like me?" 

Ji He’s eyes widened in surprise. 

As the air filled with anticipation, a new chapter was about to unfold.
