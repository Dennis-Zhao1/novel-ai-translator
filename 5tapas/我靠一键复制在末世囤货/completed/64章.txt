**Title: Waiting for You on a Rainy Day (5)**

The door opened a crack, revealing a single eye peering out, filled with trepidation as it regarded Clara Joy.

A weak voice came through the crack: "Who are you looking for?"

Upon making eye contact, the voice inside the door shifted to surprise: "Clara?"

Clara was taken aback as well. Was that you, Jiao Jiao?

As soon as she recognized Clara, Lin Jiao Jiao fully opened the door, exposing her frail form.

Clara's expression hardened at the sight.

Lin Jiao Jiao, in the body of Liu Zhaodi, was dressed inadequately for the late autumn chill, her clothes thin and barely protective against the biting wind. She seemed as if she could be blown over with a gust. Her hair was cut brutally short, looking like a dog's chew toy, with sunken features that barely held skin over them, her eyes uncomfortably large.

At fourteen years of age, she stood as tall as an average ten-year-old.

Lin Jiao Jiao—unaware of her own appearance—was finally thrilled to see Clara. Greeting Clara was allowed in this game, but she had been told not to break character and seek out Clara directly.

After waiting for what felt like an eternity, she had nearly lost her patience. Fortunately, the game had some moral rules. Since her arrival, any parts of Liu Zhaodi's body that were subject to violence had been removed for her safety, meaning people believed she had been harmed, but she hadn’t actually been.

The scars on her body were artificially generated to fit her character. Although she appeared heavily injured, she felt no pain. However, any real medical inspection might still reveal something alarming.

Hearing Lin Jiao Jiao's explanation softened Clara's anger somewhat. Still, seeing her best friend in such a dire state would infuriate anyone.

"Do you have any information on your end, Jiao Jiao?"

Clara took Lin Jiao Jiao's hand, pulling her to sit on a chair. It was a heartbreaking sight, knowing that despite there being no lasting effects, it looked painfully distressing.

Lin Jiao Jiao nodded: "This body’s sister, Liu Pandi, has a QQ account. She added someone and chats with them every night."

Since this body shared a room with its sister, it was hardly a room in the traditional sense. It was merely a partition made out of a large wooden board in the yard. In the winter, it was far from draft-proof, but for the sisters, it was a cozy little hideaway.

"Does Liu Pandi have a phone?" asked Max Lee, who had been listening patiently.

Given the family's blatant preference for sons, they likely wouldn’t have provided Liu Pandi with a phone.

Lin Jiao Jiao confirmed: "The phone was a pity gift from her part-time boss. She's been keeping it secret from her parents."

If she hadn’t hidden it, it might have been confiscated the very next day by Liu Jinbao.

Lin Jiao Jiao entered the room and retrieved the old phone, its paint chipped and the brand barely recognizable.

She powered it on, logging into Liu Pandi's QQ account, and handed the phone to Clara.

Clara received it and found Liu Pandi's QQ name was "Listening." The account had only one contact. There was also a special group titled "The Only One."

The profile picture of the contact was a photo taken on a rainy day, and Liu Pandi had noted them as "DL."

Clara raised an eyebrow at Max, noting the uncanny coincidence: the name mirrored the convenience store where Su Yun worked when the letters were reversed.

She then opened the chat history between the two.

---
DL: How have you been feeling lately?
Listening: I feel much better, thank you for your help.
DL: Don’t overexert yourself in your studies; it won’t help your condition. Remember to take breaks.
Listening: Alright, I understand.
DL: No need for thanks; I’m just glad to help you. By the way, there’s a heavy fog coming in a few days. I heard about a dismemberment case in the city; don’t go out at night.
Listening: Thank you! I will be careful!
DL: It’s getting late. You should rest early and try not to dwell on your family situation. Focus on your studies so that one day you can escape that home with your sister.
Listening: I will study hard! Goodnight.

After reading the recent chat logs, Clara scrolled up, noticing that the conversation frequency was low, with mundane topics being discussed. The person on the other side seemed aware of Liu Pandi's home circumstances and often offered encouragement, which Liu Pandi reciprocated with respect.

Also, the reference to Liu Pandi's illness piqued Clara's curiosity.

"Liu Pandi is ill?" Clara asked.

Lin Jiao Jiao shook her head. "From the original memories, Liu Pandi seemed perfectly normal, with no signs of illness."

Clara copied the contact’s QQ name and took screenshots of the chat history before returning the phone to Lin Jiao Jiao.

"Was there anything strange the night Liu Pandi was murdered?"

Clara pondered and inquired.

"Strange? Well, that night she seemed particularly happy. We had already settled in for the night when she excitedly said she was going out to the bathroom, but she was killed right outside in the yard." Lin Jiao Jiao recalled the original memories as she spoke with Clara.

Happy? 

Clara pulled out the chat history again, noting the last conversation was dated November 17, while Liu Pandi’s death occurred on November 23, six days apart. The issue likely didn't lie with the person on the other end of QQ.

No! 

There was another possibility!

Clara’s expression grew serious. What if the chat records from that night were deleted?

The only one who could have deleted them would be Liu Pandi’s murderer!

This meant that the person on the QQ account had to be connected to the murderer or might even be the murderer themselves!

Moreover, the phrasing within those messages suggested familiarity, as if they were a doctor’s. The only doctor Liu Pandi would have had access to would be the school doctor!

Liu Pandi likely couldn't afford to go to any medical institution; thus, it had to be the free school doctor.

Clara’s mind then involuntarily flashed to Lin Yin.

She dismissed the thought and decided quickly, leaving with Max Lee towards Lin Yin’s office. Lin Jiao Jiao remained behind, as she couldn’t leave just yet.

The school was quiet with vacation underway, allowing Clara and Max Lee to slip easily into Lin Yin's office.

Opening Lin Yin’s computer, Clara launched the QQ software.

Sure enough!

The person who had been chatting with Liu Pandi was indeed Lin Yin!

The QQ account on the computer was an exact match to the one captured on Clara’s phone.

Frowning at the screen, Clara felt something wasn’t quite right. The information felt too conveniently presented to her, as though someone had laid the path straight for her to find the killer.

If it were that simple, why hadn’t the police caught Lin Yin yet?

Surely if it were as easy as this, Lin Yin would have been arrested long ago.

But the QQ account was undeniably Lin Yin's!

No! 

Clara felt she was caught in a mental trap. Why did she convince herself that the account belonged to Lin Yin?

What if… it wasn’t?

With this thought, Clara exchanged a look with Max Lee. Quickly, she reached out to touch the computer's main unit—warm!

Clara dashed out, spotting a shadow in the distance. She promptly gave chase, but after running for a while, the figure vanished. Clara stopped, panting and turning to Max Lee.

"Why do I feel so weak in this body?" she huffed.

Her physical condition shouldn't be like this!

Max Lee’s voice was nervous: "For the sake of fairness in the game, the owner’s physical capabilities are aligned with those of the original character~"

Clara fell silent.
