**Galactic Warfare**

On the opposite side of the table lay a cloth emblazoned with a large character for "Food". In the center of this cloth was a seam, and from the way it was described by Clara Joy, dishes were pushed out from the middle.

"Ding dong—Welcome to Bebe's Hot Pot Restaurant~ 
Hello, lovely Miss Clara!"

Suddenly, a white light screen appeared in front of Clara, accompanied by the voice of a young man. The screen displayed various selection buttons featuring a range of TV shows, movies, and variety programs. This was a special setup by Wendy, designed to alleviate customer boredom during meals.

Clara’s excitement peaked as she realized she could watch TV here! She hadn’t had the chance to tune in for a long time! Since ordering wasn’t available here, Clara quickly navigated to her favorite variety show and clicked it to watch, sipping on a cup of cola as she did.

"Ding dong—Your broth is ready~"

The voice sounded again as the cloth was drawn aside, revealing a slick path where a steaming pot of thick white broth slid into view. Clara frowned slightly; she preferred spicy hot pot, and this broth didn’t look spicy at all.

However, as Clara hesitated, the rich aroma of the broth wafted towards her, almost magically drawing her in. Unable to resist, she took a spoonful and tasted it.

Mmm~ 

First, she was greeted by the richness of the broth, followed by freshness that suggested the presence of mushrooms. To her surprise, it then turned spicy! 

After another sip, Clara confirmed it was genuinely spicy! And not in that industrial way that just burns the lips, but the kind that slowly ramps up the heat from deep within her body to her head. 

A light sheen of sweat appeared on her forehead—just two spoonfuls, and she was already feeling the heat!

Looking at the pot now, her previous dissatisfaction faded. She would gladly consume just the broth; it made her feel incredibly comfortable!

"Ding dong—Dishes are here!"

As the voice chimed again, the slick path opened once more, and plates of ingredients came sliding up, beginning with a bowl of pre-made sauces.

Behind it, there was an array of classic hot pot items, and Clara's eyes sparkled with delight as she began throwing ingredients into the pot, wolfing down the food.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the restaurant, the first male guest, Alexander Luo, approached the realm of Solomon that Abedo had previously mentioned, holding his VIP card. 

Inside was a grand mech model surrounded by various high-tech flying vehicles, each occupied by players engaged in different activities.

As soon as Alexander stood by the entrance of the mech model, a voice resonated:

"Esteemed VIP member Mr. Luo, welcome to the battle world!"

With a series of clicks, a small half-human robot appeared before him. This mech model was entirely black, guiding him inside. Alexander found himself in a room that was furnished with a sofa and various fruits. However, to the right was an area labeled "Battle Zone".

Within was a simulation pod, where one could lie inside, and next to it, a large screen allowed the selection of desired battle locations, with an option to record videos for free downloads.

Alexander settled into the simulation pod, glanced at the selection buttons, hesitated for a moment, and then pressed the button for Galactic Warfare, reclining to prepare for the battle. 

As he closed his eyes, he felt a wave of dizziness; upon re-opening them, he heard a loud growl:

"What are you standing around for? Get out of the way!"

Startled, Alexander looked around and discovered he was seated in a small fighter jet. The voice came through his headset.

Before he could ponder why he needed to dodge, a bright light surged before him.

"Boom—"
Killed. Out of the game.
 
【You have been defeated by the enemy!】

Confused, Alexander sat up from the simulation pod, staring at the large characters on the screen. That’s it? He died without even knowing what was happening?

Not to be disheartened, Alexander re-entered the simulation. Once again, he felt the familiar dizziness and braced for that voice, but surprisingly, while the voice remained the same, the content changed.

“Unit C203, Unit C203, respond if you hear me!”

Suddenly, information about his identity appeared in his mind—he was a soldier in the interstellar army from the planet Aochier.

He could also see a task panel next to him:
【Become the General of Aochier—Task Completed!】

Huh? Alexander was puzzled; he hadn’t chosen this, had he? He thought he was just entering Galactic Warfare to fight. What was this task about?

Before he could gather his thoughts, he heard the voice in his headset again:
“Unit C203, Unit C203, respond if you hear me!”

Quickly, Alexander replied, “Unit C203 has heard you, HQ. Please instruct!”

The voice continued:
“A enemy aircraft has been spotted at star coordinates 609, Unit C203, proceed to handle it immediately, respond if you hear me!”

A coordinate popped up on his panel, highlighted in bright red. Alexander responded:
“Unit C203 has heard, proceeding to address the situation!”

The tone in the voice warmed up a little this time:
“Please, make sure to come back safely!”

Alexander blinked—this game seemed surprisingly personable.

Following the memories flooding his mind, he piloted the fighter jet toward the designated star point. 

Upon arrival, he discovered an enemy fighter jet, but scans revealed there were no life signs inside.

As he pondered this mystery, a small figure appeared in the distance. Scanning revealed it to be a girl, around twelve or thirteen years old.

The child wore torn clothes, her hair a messy tangle, giving her the appearance of having not bathed in months. She staggered towards him.

Seeing the two jets, she quickly changed direction, trying to escape.

Alexander couldn't pass up the opportunity; he maneuvered his fighter jet to block her path.

“Who are you? Have you seen any men in combat suits?”

The girl trembled in fear, visibly shaken and remaining silent, seemingly too frightened to answer.

Noticing her fright, Alexander softened his tone and asked gently,
“Little one, have you seen any men wearing red outfits?”

But before he could catch her response, the familiar white light engulfed him again.

Killed. Out of the game.
 
【Player Alexander accidentally triggered the keyword "little one," angering the interstellar natives and was killed!】

Alexander: ???
