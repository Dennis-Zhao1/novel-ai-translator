**Goodbye, Xu Jin**

Wen Keke adjusted her posture and looked at Ji He. Ji He pressed a switch in front of him, and a virtual screen materialized in the space, accompanied by a pleasant voice:

“Hello, I’m happy to assist you. Please enter your destination for this trip.”

Ji He glanced at Wen Keke, who nodded in understanding. She promptly input "Central City, Jinxiu Community."

The virtual screen displayed a map of S City, with several red lines indicating routes to Jinxiu Community. 

“The safest route has been selected. Estimated arrival in ten minutes.”

Ten minutes???

Wen Keke was astonished. They lived in the outskirts, and reaching the city center typically took more than an hour. A car ride of only ten minutes? 

It must be thanks to Mr. Ji!

Wen Keke silently speculated whether Mr. Ji might be a big-shot emerging from some research institute or another.

While Wen Keke pondered various thoughts, they soon arrived at Jinxiu Community. 

“Hello, you have arrived at your destination, Jinxiu Community. Enjoy your trip!”

Wen Keke got out of the car and watched as Ji He pressed a button, causing the entire vehicle to shrink into a white square object. 

To her surprise, Ji He handed the square to her. 

Wen Keke felt a pang of guilt; she was always taking Mr. Ji's things. But seeing a car shrink to the size she could hold made her cast aside any lingering embarrassment, embracing the mindset that as long as she was carefree, she was the richest person.

Wen Keke chuckled and happily accepted it, instantly placing it into her space.

“Let’s go, Mr. Ji.”

Ji He stepped forward, following Wen Keke toward Jinxiu Community.

Before the apocalypse, Jinxiu Community was the most luxurious neighborhood in S City, housing only the elite, with each unit fully equipped. 

Wen Keke envisioned transforming her warm inn into the most opulent hotel, so she sought to acquire a building in Jinxiu Community.

A man and a woman, one tall and one short, entered the Jinxiu Community.

Xu Jin sat by the window, convinced he was already dead. Could there truly be another world beyond death? 

He glimpsed at people…

Since the extreme cold hit over two months ago, Xu Jin had survived by relying on the supplies he stocked up after receiving reminders from Wen Keke, along with government aid. 

However, a month ago, the government had stopped the aid, and Xu Jin's supplies dwindled visibly day by day. Just a few hours earlier, he had completely run out.

Thinking he might as well have one last look at this ravaged world before he dies, he sat by the window.

Now, his body was frozen stiff, face pale and bluish, with frostbite all over his hands. He was wrapped in several layers of thick blankets, hair disheveled, beard unkempt, looking every bit like a vagrant, a stark contrast to the spirited person he was two months ago.

Wen Keke scanned the area, hoping to find a well-preserved building. Suddenly, she spotted a figure by the window on the third floor of the building across from her.

Hmm???

When did her eyesight become so sharp? She could actually see a person's face from such a distance!

Narrowing her eyes, she carefully examined the figure.

Wasn't that Xu Jin??? He lived in this community too? 

Wen Keke recalled that Xu Jin indeed had a unit here but had been staying away from the Xu family mansion due to family troubles.

Seeing Xu Jin breathe out more heavily than he breathed in, she recalled the weaponry before the apocalypse and decided to save him! Without him, she wouldn't have all those weapons either.

Wen Keke turned and pointed at the building, addressing Ji He, “There’s a friend of mine in that building. I’m going over now; are you coming, Mr. Ji?”

Ji He didn’t respond verbally, but the fact that he was already following her step confirmed his answer.

Wen Keke chuckled inwardly, thinking how kind Mr. Ji was! She mentally awarded him a Good Person Card.

The two hastily ascended to the third floor, reaching Xu Jin's door. Wen Keke stepped forward and kicked the door open with one swift motion. Observing Ji He's unruffled expression, she reckoned it wasn't surprising that she had such strength after all.

Mr. Ji had seen far more than this!

Wen Keke hurried inside and saw Xu Jin curled up by the window. She quickly retrieved numerous heating pads and a rechargeable heating device from her space and crouched down beside Xu Jin.

“Xu Jin? Xu Jin?”

Xu Jin's consciousness was fading. He felt like he was on the verge of death, relieved to finally say goodbye to this harrowing apocalypse.

[Xu Jin~ Xu Jin~]

Who? Who’s calling me?

Xu Jin attempted to open his eyes, but his eyelids, damaged by the frost, wouldn’t cooperate. 

Feeling a warm object being stuffed into his arms, Xu Jin instinctively wanted to grasp it tighter, instinctively shifting closer to the warmth as his consciousness faded.

Wen Keke abandoned the idea of sticking heating pads to Xu Jin. Besides the challenge of applying them in this frigid state, doing so would require him to remove the outer layers of his blankets, during which Xu Jin could potentially freeze to death.

She directly shoved several heating devices into his arms and, using sheer strength, lifted the tall man, along with the layers of blankets he was wrapped in.

Wen Keke hurried down the stairs, pulling Xu Jin along, before retrieving the car she had just stored and amplifying it to fit Xu Jin inside.

She adjusted the internal temperature to 20 degrees Celsius. She couldn't set it too high right away, as Xu Jin’s body had grown accustomed to the cold.

She closed the door and, in front of Ji He, effortlessly stored Xu Jin's building within her space. If there were any living persons inside, she'd feel resistance from her space.

The outcome was evident—there were no living people left in that building.

She also stored the nearby community supermarket in her space.

Noticing Ji He's gaze upon her, Wen Keke chuckled, “My space is, well... quite spacious!”

After saying this, she jumped into the car. Ji He gave her a puzzled look. He hadn’t intended to question her about the space; he was merely contemplating the fact that a building was being used as storage...

On the way back to the villa, Wen Keke saw the largest library in S City. Hesitating for a moment, she decided to get out and store the library too.

Humanity needed inheritance; she envisioned building a library in her community.

Upon returning to Wen Keke's villa, she quickly arranged a simple guest room for Xu Jin on the first floor, turning on the underfloor heating and preparing electric blankets and heating devices, gently placing Xu Jin on the bed.

Once she settled Xu Jin’s needs, it was nearly one o'clock. The buildings in her space would have to stay there for now, waiting to be replicated—one building a day, two days for four buildings, three days for eight buildings...

This layer contained twenty-six stories, and Wen Keke planned to wait until the space replicated ten buildings before taking them out, since they were currently entering through the back of the villa, avoiding her warm inn. With Xu Jin needing time to recuperate inside, it was a good cover.

After asking Ji He what he wanted to eat for lunch, Wen Keke began preparations. She decided to make spicy roasted duck for lunch!

She gathered ginger, scallions, garlic, onions, and cilantro to fry until fragrant before fishing them out. Then she added in bay leaves, cinnamon, Sichuan peppercorn, and dried chili, frying until they changed color.

Next, she took a bowl, mixing both coarse and fine chili powder, white sesame, five-spice powder, and salt. Then she poured the hot oil from the pan over the mixture, stirred it, and set it aside.

Using the frying oil, she cooked the ginger, scallions, garlic, onions, and hot pot base until fragrant, then added water to boil, seasoning with a little salt and soy sauce, fishing out any remaining bits.

At this point, she added in the previously prepared ingredients—plenty of tripe because both Wen Keke and Ji He loved it—and sequentially fished them out after cooking. 

Finally, she added the store-bought roasted duck, letting it simmer for about two minutes.

Once everything was combined in a large bowl, she placed the roasted duck on top and poured the spicy oil mixture over it, garnishing with some chopped green onions~

Perfect!

Wen Keke gazed at the massive bowl—truly more like a basin—of roasted duck, struggling to contain her drool.

Setting it on the dining table, she noticed Ji He already seated, smelling the deliciousness, with a bowl of rice before him.

Wen Keke also prepared some raw bones and freeze-dried food for Jinbao, along with reconstituted goats' milk powder.

Finally, she sat down and began to eat. Ji He didn’t touch his chopsticks until she was settled before starting to eat as well.
