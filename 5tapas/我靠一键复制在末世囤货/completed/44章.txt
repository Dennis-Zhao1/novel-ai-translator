**Let Go of That Man**

As the base construction heated up in Huaguo, the atmosphere in the Zhao family home in City D was far from pleasant.

Old Master Zhao, Zhao Wuxun, sixty-seven years of age, had three children. The eldest, a daughter named Sophie Zhao, was already married. Before the apocalypse, the Zhao family had gathered their daughter, son-in-law, and grandson back home. 

The second child was a son, Ethan Zhao. Zhao Wuxun had invested much effort in this son from a young age, personally overseeing his upbringing, only to end up as a disappointment. 

The youngest, Edward Zhao, was born around the same time as Ethan, just about two years apart. Due to Zhao Wuxun's intense focus on his second son, the third son received scant attention. However, to everyone's surprise, Edward turned out to be far more remarkable than the son he had meticulously raised. 

It was Edward who came up with the idea for the partnership with the Sikou family. Old Master Zhao, who had previously allied himself with Wang Houshan, the patriarch of the Wang family, had high hopes for his own next generation to bring him success. Unfortunately, his son Ethan had also failed to compete with Wang Youshan, the son of Old Master Wang, leading to a lifetime of defeat in the hands of the Wang patriarch.

So when Edward spoke about the Sikou family, Zhao Wuxun felt an opportunity had arrived – a chance to overturn the Wang family.

With the assurance from the Sikou family, the Zhao family was flourishing in their secretly constructed base in City D, completely indifferent to the happenings of the Wang family in City A. Little did they know, the Wang family members had already fled City A with the remaining survivors.

At that moment, Edward Zhao, trying to suppress his rage, confronted Sikou Yu, saying, "How could they just disappear? When we agreed to collaborate, your Sikou family guaranteed that the Wang family would always be in City A. So where are they now?"

Sikou Yu, sitting on the sofa and looking at his holographic console, was becoming increasingly impatient. How was it that his older brother had yet to respond to him? Here he was, dealing with this inferior human from Bluesky who dared to lay blame on him.

"You think you have the right to criticize me? What are you?" Sikou Yu kicked his leg towards Edward Zhao, who bent over backward and spat out blood.

"Cough, cough, I’m sorry; I lost my temper, it wasn’t intentional..." 

Realizing he had overstepped, Edward quickly apologized, horrified as thoughts of Sikou Yu’s ruthless capabilities flooded his mind.

Hiss~ 

This person was no ordinary human! How had he forgotten not to provoke him?

Sikou Yu withdrew his leg and leaned back, stating coolly, "Remember, you are just a dog for the Sikou family. Don’t think that collaborating gives you the right to call the shots. Get lost!"

Edward Zhao quickly nodded, "Yes, yes, don’t be angry! I'm leaving now."

Bowing his head, Edward fled the room.

Once far away, he glanced back, swallowing his anger as he returned to the Zhao residence.

Meanwhile, at the Central Star of the Alan Star System,
in the Assembly Hall.

"Why are you here today, sir?" Sikou Zhen looked warily at the man across the table.

What was a member of the Prophecy Institute doing here? Had news of his younger brother's trip to Bluesky leaked?

Sitting opposite the Grand Elder Sikou Zhen was a white-haired man in a blue robe, his demeanor cool and distant, resembling a snow lotus that was far removed from the mundane. His features were striking, but the most captivating aspect was the streak of red on his forehead—like fire, or a rose blossoming solely for him.

The blue robe accentuated his refined aura; his pale skin and flowing white hair created an air of sanctity that was simultaneously intimidating, yet the red hue softened his presence, making him more approachable.

He was Mu Qingran, the latest Death Envoy of the Prophecy Institute.

The Prophecy Institute was known for its ability to foresee events and never engaged in political struggles, solely concerned with the interests of the Alan Star System. As long as nothing threatened the system's interests, they remained relatively uninvolved.

The Death Envoy was the strongest of all seers in the Prophecy Institute, capable of commanding all other seers. Only the Death Envoy from the Prophecy Institute could join forces with Death Envoys from the other three major star systems to form a Galactic Tribunal.

So it could be said that the Death Envoy represented the utmost power of every star system—except for a notable exception in the Star Tower of the Alan Star System.

Mu Qingran gazed at Grand Elder Sikou Zhen without any hint of emotion, as if the man before him didn’t warrant his attention.

"Sikou Yu from the Assembly Hall has violated Article 138 of the Galactic Treaty. Advanced star humans are prohibited from appearing on lower-tier planets. The penalty is ten Red Crystal Stars."

As he spoke, a holographic image appeared above them, displaying scenes of Sikou Yu from Bluesky.

Grand Elder Sikou Zhen found himself unable to refute this and reluctantly accepted the penalty of losing those ten Red Crystal Stars.

He knew how much profit those Red Crystal Stars brought to his family each year, and just like that, they were gone...

Teeth clenched, Sikou Zhen completed the transfer agreement for the ten Red Crystal Stars.

Mu Qingran accepted it casually and turned, his white hair fluttering as he departed, making it seem as if he had only come to collect something.

But instead of returning to the Prophecy Institute, he sent a message to someone through his holographic console.

[Completed.]

The other party replied instantly.

[Mm.]

Seeing the simple response, a smile curved at the corners of Mu Qingran's mouth.

In Bluesky, as the base was under construction, the supermarket in Keke Wen's neighborhood reached a peak in business. 

Military children from Huaguo flocked to the supermarket because it was the only store in the apocalypse offering a complete range of products—food, drink, clothing, essentials, you name it. Even survivors stationed at the base would form teams to come and shop, although due to limited resources, they couldn't buy much. 

At this moment, Jih Hui frowned in front of a woman blocking his way at the supermarket entrance. He was merely there to buy snacks that he had finished eating, yet this woman had been pestering him endlessly. His temper had improved significantly, and refraining from striking her on sight was already a sign of his restraint. But she didn't seem to grasp the situation and kept bothering him.

Half of Jih Hui's mind was on getting rid of her, while the other half recognized that this was Keke Wen's territory, and he shouldn't cause trouble.

The woman in front wore a dirty red cotton coat, her hair dry and split from malnutrition, and her face was pale yet she fancied herself attractive. She approached Jih Hui, her voice sweetened with feigned shyness, “Hey there, handsome, are you here to shop too? Could you help me out? I haven’t eaten in ages...”

She flicked her hair, trying to present her "best angle" to him, and looked down with an expression full of innocence.

Jih Hui suppressed his anger, his voice low, "Get lost!"

Feigning ignorance, the woman attempted to lean against Jih Hui, murmuring, “Oh no, I think I sprained my ankle…” 

Just as Jih Hui was ready to lose his temper, deciding to just hit her since she was so obnoxious, Keke Wen hurried over after hearing about his situation from Xu Jin.

"Stop it! Let go of that man!"
