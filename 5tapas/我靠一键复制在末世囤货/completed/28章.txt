**Evacuation Plan for City A**

Wendy Wen's expression was a bit serious as she approached the window and glanced outside, discovering that the heavy snowfall had finally stopped. 

This is… the calm before the flood!

Wendy had experienced this once before; the snow only stopped before the floodwaters rose. Had the flood come early?

With a heavy heart, Wendy looked outside, pondering if this was the result of the butterfly effect from her reincarnation. 

She descended the stairs, feeling a weight on her mind. The other three were already there, and the atmosphere felt strangely quiet.

Wendy cast a curious glance at her companions. James Xu’s features were twisted with concern, and he was furtively glancing sideways, signaling Wendy to look in that direction. 

Following his gaze, she was astonished to see that the dining table was already set with a variety of dishes and a heated hot pot, just waiting for the ingredients.

"Did you prepare this, James?" Wendy asked, bewildered. With a human and two extraterrestrials in the mix, she had never expected it to be the aliens' doing.

James felt a sudden jolt of alarm and cautiously glanced at Simon Ji. While Simon’s expression was unreadable, James sensed a chill in the air.

"Of course not! Miss Wen, this was all prepared by Mr. Ji!" 

Wendy's eyes widened in shock as she looked at James, who nodded silently. 

"Oh my! As expected of Mr. Ji! I could smell the aroma from my room and rushed over!" she exclaimed dramatically.

Simon shot her a sidelong glance, clearly displeased. Wendy wondered what she had said wrong. After all, she had exaggerated to convey the delightful scent of Simon's hotpot!

Noticing that Wendy hadn't grasped his meaning, Simon felt inexplicably indifferent and said, “The name.” 

Wendy suddenly understood and called out, “Simon Ji! Truly, it’s Simon Ji's cooking! It smells wonderful!”

Once Wendy took her seat, Simon finally picked up his chopsticks and began to eat. Taisuke Ji Yu rolled her eyes and scoffed silently—this scheming man should not think he could win over her little kitty.

However, Taisuke remained quiet since Simon was the one who had prepared the meal, and since she couldn’t cook either, she was eagerly waiting to eat. She thought, what if that madman wouldn’t let her eat if she spoke out?

James discreetly scowled at the food.

After dinner, as soon as James returned from washing the dishes, Wendy shared her observations about the changing weather. 

The impending floods wouldn’t affect her, but the people in City A...

James calmly said, “In the apocalypse, life and death are fated, and fortunes lie in the heavens. I believe we should stick to our previous plan.”

He did want to help, especially since there were millions of people affected, not just one or two lives, and he had family in City A, but his power was limited. Besides, not everyone would believe him. The priority was to ensure their own safety, and he absolutely couldn't risk Wendy encountering danger.

Wendy held similar thoughts. She couldn’t deny her coldness; to be fair, those people were unrelated to her. After all, in her previous life, that mob had taken advantage of the weak and bullied anyone they could. She might have only seen a fraction of it, but she held little fondness for the people of City A. It was simply a bitter reminder of how vicious humanity could be during a collapse.

Meanwhile, in a building far away in City A...

"Report!"

"Come in."

A middle-aged man, radiating an overwhelming aura that demanded respect even in his silence, sat at the desk, his voice deep and commanding.

The door opened, and a female soldier wearing military attire and a cap entered.

"Sir, you called for me?" 

The officer at the desk was General David Wang, the commander of the largest military district in City A. He looked at the daughter of his former comrade, sighing heavily. 

"Jiaojiao, why haven’t you gone to City S? What would I say to Old Lin if something happened to you?"

Upon hearing "City S," Jiaojiao's eyes glimmered with an emotion she quickly masked, her expression remaining serious. "Sir, I can't leave. City A needs me right now."

General Wang sighed again, adjusting his demeanor. "Then, soldier Jiaojiao, gather all available team members and prepare for the evacuation of the survivors in City A!"

Jiaojiao's expression turned incredulous. "But sir, what about the Zhao family...?"

City A was divided into two factions: the Zhao family led the external faction while the Wang family headed the internal faction.

The external faction was led by the Sierko family—indeed, the upper echelons were already aware that there were other interstellar human groups beyond Blue Star.

The Sierko family represented these outsiders, collaborating with the Zhao family, providing advanced interstellar weaponry while Zhao handled the unrestricted mining of Blue Star's resources. Before the apocalypse, the Zhao family had already prepared everything in anticipation of the Blue Star Project.

The Wang family, however, prioritized human interests, having opposed profit-driven families like the Zhao's before the apocalypse. As the catastrophe loomed closer, they finally realized the Zhao family's questionable intentions and, after much effort, uncovered the truth that they had collaborated with outsiders for their gain, an arrangement that had been in place for quite some time.

The Blue Star Project was a plan designed to exploit every natural method to exterminate Blue Star’s humans, reducing resource wastage. They had observed that Blue Star humans were physically weak; thus, they employed a series of natural disasters—extreme cold, floods, extreme heat, earthquakes, acid rain, and so on. 

But why didn’t the Sierko family simply send in troops to eradicate them?

Due to interstellar agreements among the Eternal, Radiant Moon, Semi-Mech, and Illan star systems, no one could use interstellar forces for their own ends to exterminate the indigenous people of less advanced planets, or else they would face trial at the interstellar court.

The representatives of the council found a loophole that allowed for methods not involving human intervention, which led to the formation of the Blue Star Project.

The interstellar court was the most impartial and just entity composed of the four major star systems’ oracles, resolving any significant war or threats to the interstellar safety amongst themselves.

The consequences for any family or faction that found themselves taken to the court were dire; historically, they were always divided among the four major star systems, leaving no room for resistance.

The oracles possessed weaponry that surpassed anything available in the current market; there was simply no competition.

Once the patriarch of the Wang family, Grandpa David Wang, learned of this news, he promptly issued preparations that ultimately salvaged some significant losses during the apocalypse.

General David Wang was the second in command of the Wang family and worked primarily within the military district. His elder brother, Max Wang, was in politics and the public face of the family, primarily battling against the Li family.

Jiaojiao was the daughter of his old comrade, Lin Haode, who tragically died in a plane crash, and General Wang had looked out for Jiaojiao in the army.

Initially, the Wang family believed City A wasn’t the ideal base location; the Zhao family had already retreated to City D, and they were considering an evacuation as well.

However, they didn’t expect the Sierko family’s patriarch, Simon Sierko, to remain in City A to counterbalance them. Controlling the political hub of the nation meant that if they maintained control, the Zhao family would dominate externally, facilitating their plans.

From the onset of the apocalypse until now, the Wang family and the original residents of City A found it nearly impossible to leave the city.

Recently, they learned that the Sierko patriarch had become reclusive and indifferent to affairs. Rumors suggested he was injured. 

Seizing this opportunity, the Wang family hastened preparations to evacuate City A’s residents, aiming to move them to nearby City S. After several months of preparation, they were confident that they could achieve extensive evacuations with minimal losses.

General Wang spoke solemnly, “Everything is set. Remember, the evacuation must be swift.”

Jiaojiao straightened and boldly replied, “Yes, Sir!” 

With that, she turned and exited, ready to implement the evacuation plan.
