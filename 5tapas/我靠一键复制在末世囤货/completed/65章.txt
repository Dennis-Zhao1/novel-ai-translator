Rainy Days, Who Are You Waiting For (6)

Early the next morning, while Clara Joy was comfortably wrapped up in her blankets, there was a sound at the door. Rubbing her eyes, she went to answer it.

“Coming~”

Clara couldn't help but yawn; she had stayed up late organizing the information she had gathered yesterday.

Ethan Zhou stood at the door, holding breakfast he had bought. He walked into Clara's home.

“Lin confessed.”

Clara's drowsy mind suddenly snapped awake.

“??? What?”

Confessed? Although he was her primary suspect, wasn’t there insufficient evidence? Why would he confess?

Ethan peeled a hard-boiled egg as he spoke, “After we finish eating, let’s head to the police station.”

Once the egg was peeled, Ethan placed it in a bowl for Clara and prepared a straw for her soy milk.

Clara nodded while she ate, “Sure.”

Going to the police station would be good; she needed to find out why Lin had confessed.

At the police station, Clara stared at Lin, who was sitting across the glass. Though he was dressed in prison clothes, he still exuded an air of scholarly sophistication. When he saw Clara, a flicker of surprise crossed his eyes.

“Lu, I didn’t expect it to be you.”

Clara flashed her signature smile, “Dr. Lin, you’re not the killer, right?”

Lin maintained a steady expression, still smiling gently.

“Lu, I killed him. The evidence is conclusive.”

Clara locked eyes with Lin and continued, “Dr. Lin, are you protecting someone?”

Lin’s expression remained unchanged: “I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”

“Let me take a guess~ Is it… your wife, Grace Gao?”

At the mention of Grace's name, a hint of panic flitted across Lin's face but quickly disappeared, as if it was a figment of Clara's imagination.

“What does that have to do with Lin? I killed him.”

Clara stood up, leaning her hands on the table as she stared at Lin, enunciating each word firmly, “Dr. Lin, the law is just. It doesn’t wrongly accuse good people, nor will it let any criminal go.”

After saying this, Clara didn’t look at Lin’s expression and walked straight out of the police station. Ethan glanced back at Lin, a thoughtful look in his eyes, before following Clara out.

“Ethan, let’s visit Lin’s house,” Clara said as she got into the car.

“Okay.” 

Ethan replied quietly, knowing his role in this game was to always guard Clara, offering his quiet support without expecting anything in return as long as she was happy.

When they arrived at Lin’s upscale neighborhood, it was evident of wealth with its perfect landscaping and security. 

Since Clara and Ethan didn’t have a key card and the guards did not recognize them, they climbed over the wall to get in.

Following the information they had gathered, Clara and Ethan made their way to Lin’s backyard.

They quietly climbed up to the second-floor balcony from the garden.

“You go that way, I’ll go this way. Let’s search separately,” Clara suggested, pointing to a direction for speed.

Ethan smiled at Clara: “Alright, I’ll follow your lead.”

Clara climbed through a window, realizing it was the master bedroom. On the bedside table was a photo of Lin and a woman.

In the photo, the woman had a gentle appearance, smiling as she leaned against Lin’s shoulder, both looking at the camera. This was Lin’s wife, Grace Gao.

On the nightstand was a diary. Clara picked it up and was surprised that it didn’t have a lock. Raising an eyebrow, she opened the diary.

Happy…

Clara flipped through, finding nothing more; the diary started with daily entries and gradually shifted to writing about months apart, revealing how much Grace loved her husband Lin.

Just then, she heard a noise at the door. Holding the diary, Clara leaned over to peek outside, revealing one eye toward the door.

“Click—”

The bedroom door swung open, revealing a soft hand that seemed almost boneless, with a faint birthmark at the wrist. Clara found it vaguely familiar. Looking up, she saw the face of the young woman from the photo—Lin's wife, Grace Gao.

With a smile, Grace entered the bedroom, changed into a new outfit from the wardrobe, grabbed her bag, and left.

At that moment, Ethan also approached, and Clara signaled him to follow. They trailed Grace all the way to the police station. 

Was she here to see Lin? 

Ethan then handed Clara a piece of paper. Clara looked up at it—hmm? A medical report?

“Found it in the study,” Ethan explained.

Patient: Grace Gao
Age: 23
Diagnosis: Paranoid Personality Disorder…
Diagnosis date: June 21, 2022.

Grace has a mental illness?
