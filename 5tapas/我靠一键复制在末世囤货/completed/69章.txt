**Today, the 'daughter' raised by her mother is getting married!**

Wendy Keke bent down to pick up her cat, Gem, and looked at the black cat in the corner. The cat's glossy black fur shimmered, revealing that it was well-fed. Wendy wondered who was taking care of it; its long hair reminded her of a Maine Coon, giving it a majestic air.

The black cat's emerald green eyes fixed on Wendy, devoid of any aggression, as if it were a beautifully crafted sculpture.

Wendy buried Gem's head into her arms and said to the black cat, “My Gem can never be with you, so give up on that idea!”

After saying that, she ignored the cat’s reaction and turned back towards the villa.

At that moment, she felt like a mother who had raised her daughter diligently only to have some nasty man trying to take her away—no way was that cat going to charm away her Gem.

Once inside, Wendy began to scold Gem again.

“What were you thinking, carrying your little mat over there? It has no home and no food; what do you see in it?”

She poked Gem’s forehead deliberately, trying to appear fierce.

“Meow~”

Gem licked Wendy’s finger instead, seemingly confused yet affectionate.

“Hey, I’m trying to have a serious conversation here!”

Gem continued to lick, as if trying to please Wendy.

“Keep pretending!”

Wendy surrendered to Gem's gentle charms; how could anyone resist such an adorable kitty?

“Boss, someone from the Bright Dawn Base has arrived,” Xu Jin said as he entered, looking slightly guilty as if caught playing a game.

Wendy was puzzled; why would they come during the New Year?

She set Gem down and walked out to find David Wang and Chairman Wang hurrying in, their faces showing signs of urgency.

Wendy’s curiosity deepened—what could be so pressing?

“Miss Wendy, Happy New Year!” David Wang said, trying to mask the anxiousness on his face with a smile.

Wendy returned the smile, “Mr. Wang, Happy New Year! What brings you here?”

David’s smile faded, replaced by concern:

“We're here for a specific reason. We've made contact with survivors in other cities, but the flood is ferocious, and our boat can’t deliver supplies. The situation there is urgent, so we came to see if you could sell us some flood-resistant boats or parts.”

After all, if there was anyone who could help, it would be Wendy.

Wendy thought for a moment; she didn’t recall having boats in her space at all. Just as she was about to decline, the voice of Xingyun, her intelligent weapon assistant, chimed in.

“Master, have you forgotten I can transform into a boat? Any size you need!”

Wendy was taken aback. “You can turn into a boat? I thought you were just a weapon assistant?”

“Yes, Master! The boat I transform into has offensive capabilities and is absolutely safe!”

Understanding Xingyun’s intention, Wendy pondered it over and asked David Wang, “Where are the survivors now?”

David Wang, sensing that Wendy might have a solution, explained, “The military bases in S City and D City used to be established by Huaguo. They're currently at the D City military base, but due to the flooding, they can’t get out. Since supplies are running low, we need boats to transport them. We can pay whichever amount in lava stones you want, Miss Wendy, but time is of the essence.”

Wendy recalled the Huaguo map; D City was at the northernmost point, sitting on higher ground, while S City was on the eastern edge. Between the two were A City and B City, where the Zhao family was located...

“Alright, I have a boat for transport. Flat rate: eighty million lava stones for a round trip. As for supplies, we can use the prices in the previous contract.”

Wendy considered that delivering supplies to D City would take about two days, and returning would take another two. By then, Xingyun should have finished preparations, and they would conveniently pass by B City. Hehe, in that case...

Wendy couldn’t help but smile slyly to herself.

David Wang and Chairman Wang exchanged eager glances upon hearing Wendy’s agreement.

“Excellent! We’ll meet all of Miss Wendy’s conditions. Having you, Miss Wendy, is truly an honor for Huaguo!”

David Wang regarded Wendy fondly. The lava stones didn’t matter; they were vital for Huaguo’s foundational resources during this apocalypse.

Having the Wen family in Huaguo was a stroke of good fortune! They were practically a treasure chest on legs!

“I told you, Miss Wendy is a magnanimous person! What were you worried about?” Chairman Wang teased David.

David Wang laughed, not offended at all: “I was just overthinking it! Haha! Now, Miss Wendy, shall we discuss the supplies?”

Wendy naturally agreed and gestured for them to proceed. 

After talks concluded, Wendy arranged to depart first thing in the morning. Given the urgency of the situation, Elder Ji Yu and Ji He would accompany Wendy. Xu Jin would remain behind to keep an eye on Dreamland, while Lin Jiaojiao had already returned to the Bright Dawn Base to lead their people along with General Wei.

Due to Wendy’s ownership of spatial equipment, David Wang wasn’t shy about spending. He waved his hand and procured nearly a billion lava stones worth of supplies, deciding to dispatch a hundred thousand troops with her to D City for support.

With an early departure planned, Wendy settled in for a relatively early night’s sleep. In the middle of the night, she vaguely heard a few cat calls and initially thought nothing of it, until it hit her—the black cat!

Wendy sat up abruptly, glancing at her bed to find Gem had vanished.

Following the sound of the meows, Wendy stepped outside and found the black cat again, this time beside a wild chicken carcass that was only about half the cat's size.

The black cat sat regally, while Gem snoozed beside it, purring softly. The black cat’s ears perked up as it quietly regarded Wendy and meowed, “Meow~”

It looked from Wendy to the chicken.

“Is that for me?”

Wendy pointed at the chicken in disbelief, bewildered.

“Meow~”

The black cat elegantly stretched, as if responding affirmatively, before picking up the chicken and presenting it to Wendy.

Gem awoke, bounding towards Wendy and meowing excitedly. Wendy looked down at the two contrasting figures at her feet—one golden and one black.

Oh dear!

Even the hardest heart would soften in front of such a polite kitty!

Suddenly, the black cat dashed off, and Wendy was left wondering what it was up to until it came back, this time with a white flower in its mouth.

Could this cat really have turned magical? It knew to bring flowers?!

Wendy was both amused and speechless as she squatted down to pat the black cat, which sat still, allowing her to stroke its fur.

“Alright then, given your courtesy, I won’t stop you from seeing Gem anymore~”

Wendy couldn’t help herself—the cat was just too polite, so gentlemanly as it doted on Gem, truly a gentle giant in the feline kingdom.

“Meow~”

The black cat responded to Wendy, its emerald eyes filled with affection as it looked at Gem and gave its fur another affectionate lick.
