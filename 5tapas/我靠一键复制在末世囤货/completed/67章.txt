**Waiting in the Rain (Part 8)**

On the bus, Emily Wen smiled as she gazed at the retreating scenery outside. She understood now; it was Ethan...

Twenty minutes later, at the entrance of Jinlin Garden, Emily and Jialing Ji arrived almost simultaneously.

“Emily, what’s going on? Why did you suddenly come here?” Jialing exclaimed, rushing over to take Emily's hand with a concerned look.

Emily clasped Jialing’s hand back and smiled, “It’s nothing. It’s just that we all misjudged the culprit.”

Jialing gasped, covering her mouth. “Isn’t the culprit Gao Linlin?”

Emily just smiled without saying a word.

Jialing looked at Emily in confusion. Why did she feel that Emily seemed a bit different from usual?

The three of them climbed over the wall as they used to and arrived at Ethan's home. To their surprise, the villa door was already wide open, and the lights inside were bright, as if welcoming guests.

Emily raised an eyebrow and led Jialing and He Ji inside.

Inside, they found Ethan and the fake Gao Linlin—no, it was actually Su Xinyue—sitting on the sofa, facing the door as if deliberately waiting for them.

With an unchanged expression, Emily walked in confidently and sat down opposite Ethan.

“Long time no see, Ru.” Ethan picked up a teacup and smiled at Emily, his handsome features showing a hint of danger beneath his usual charm.

Emily returned the smile, soft and harmless. “Dr. Lin, no, I should call you Luo Ran? It hasn't been that long, right? We only saw each other the day before yesterday. I suppose with your age, you might not remember clearly.”

Ethan, or rather Luo Ran, was momentarily taken aback but continued to smile. “Miss Wen, your remarks are very entertaining~”

Emily crossed her arms, looking at him. “I’ve always been entertaining. Right, Ji?”

Beside them, the fake Gao Linlin—no, it was now known as Tai Shu Jiyu—glanced at the crystal chandelier above her, appearing indifferent.

Emily fixed her gaze on Tai Shu Jiyu’s direction. Finally, unable to withstand Emily's scrutiny, Jiyu smiled nervously. “Oh, little kitty, are you calling me?”

“Mhm.” Emily made a few humming noises.

“How did the little kitty recognize me?” Jiyu changed the topic.

Emily was now more engaged. “I didn’t expect it to be you. At first, I thought Gao Linlin was the murderer since what Jialing said made a lot of sense, didn’t it, Jialing?”

Emily turned her gaze toward Jialing.

Jialing touched her nose, looking elsewhere and remained silent.

Cough, cough. She knew nothing, apparently.

Emily then looked over at He Ji, who returned her gaze.

“I didn’t hide anything from you.” He Ji raised his hands in surrender.

Alright, Emily turned her eyes back to Ethan, sitting on the sofa.

“Your hints were perfect, but perhaps a little too forceful.”

Ethan raised his brows. “Do tell.”

Emily continued, “Gao Linlin indeed has a mental illness, but it was caused intentionally by Ethan. He began as the perfect partner in the eyes of her family and later the perfect husband according to Gao Linlin herself. Ethan made Gao Linlin quit her job, cutting her off from society, while continuously suggesting thoughts about having a child, keeping Gao Linlin in a state of guilt and fear of losing him. This led to her developing an authoritative effect toward him, akin to a form of psychological manipulation, wouldn’t you agree, Dr. Lin?”

“So? What does this have to do with the murder case?” Ethan asked.

Emily smiled slightly and replied slowly, “Of course it’s related because this forms a perfect cover for your murder, Dr. Lin. What could arouse less suspicion towards you than having a wife with a delusional disorder? After all, everyone would suspect Gao Linlin was the murderer.

You, at age 26, major in psychology with a graduate degree abroad in human anatomy, where you met your girlfriend, an 18-year-old Su Xinyue. Upon returning to the country, you married Gao Linlin through an arranged marriage facilitated by your parents.

You truly are perfect—a prime candidate—if only your intentions weren’t about ensnaring Gao Linlin instead. You and Su Xinyue met at an interesting party called KIF, short for ‘Killing is Fun,’ consisting entirely of psychopathic individuals. 

Upon discovering that you both shared similar interests in Haian City, your relationship blossomed, leading you to your first task together—murder. That was your debut as a killer, executed flawlessly. As graduation neared, you discovered your engagement to Gao Linlin and devised a plan to groom her into being your facade, using her family’s history of mental illness as an advantage. 

Gradually, you got closer to her, planting suggestive thoughts, carefully dismantling her psyche until she became a neurotic wreck. Su Yuyin was your first target to eliminate, being the half-sister of the arrogant and fierce Su Xinyue, certainly not someone who would find favor with her. 

Thus began your plan; to get close to Su Yuyin, you pretended to open a dessert shop, taking the opportunity to teach her, then lured her out during a foggy night, where you both murdered her and staged the convenience store as the first crime scene.”

Seeing Ethan's surprised expression, Emily took an old smartphone out of her pocket. It looked like it had seen better days, but she opened it to reveal a QQ account—it read ‘DL.’

“Interestingly enough, I happened upon this phone while visiting the convenience store yesterday. It was hidden in the grass outside.”

Emily waved the phone in the air. “Inside, I found something intriguing—a QQ account that matched the one in Liu Pan's phone. 

Dr. Lin, you’re quite the strategist. The QQ account clearly belongs to Gao Linlin, yet the conversations were with you. How can we confidently say this is you and not Gao Linlin on her phone? 

Do you enjoy listening to a particular song called ‘Waiting in the Rain’? The lyrics were penned by a writer longing for his beloved, whose surname is Lin—hence the playful nickname netizens gave it, ‘Waiting for Lin.’ You must have listened to it quite a bit, and when you forged Gao Linlin’s diary, it inadvertently popped up in your script.”

Emily played the song, and its haunting melody filled the room. 
“Who are you waiting for in the rain~
“Who do you think of on a rainy day~
“Under the umbrella lies our memories~ 
“…”

The lyrics mirrored the contents of Gao Linlin’s diary.

Ethan’s surprise vanished, replaced by a gleeful smile as he sat there, intrigued. "And then?"
