**The Adorable Kitty**

At the dining table, when Adam took out the wine to pour for everyone, Clara felt that she had forgotten something, but couldn’t quite recall what it was.

After finishing the meal, Clara looked at the drunken figures of her friends, Aunt Jiyu and Ethan, and rubbed her forehead helplessly. 

Finally, it dawned on her what she had forgotten.

She had forgotten whether these two aliens had ever drunk alcohol before!

“Don’t worry, little kitty~ I’ll protect you! Who’s trying to hurt my little kitty?” Aunt Jiyu said, draping one arm protectively around Clara’s shoulders while pointing dramatically at Adam across the table.

Adam raised both hands in a gesture of surrender, looking utterly innocent. He actually wanted to leave, but the glare from Ethan made him too afraid to move.

“It’s not me, I swear! Don't make wild accusations!”

Clara supported Aunt Jiyu and gently reassured her, “No one wants to hurt me, Aunt Jiyu. Let’s go home and get some sleep, okay? Be good~”

Aunt Jiyu, her eyes glassy with drunkenness, gazed at Clara with flushed cheeks, a bit of wine on her lips, and slightly opened her mouth to protest, “No! That guy has bad intentions! I’m not going back!”

This time, she was referring to Ethan, who, although not visibly drunk, sat there like a statue, taking a moment to realize that Aunt Jiyu was talking about him.

Ethan looked bewildered, tilting his head slightly towards Clara.

Clara was at her wit's end.

She hoisted Aunt Jiyu over her shoulder, walked outside, and opened the interstellar vehicle to place her inside and send her home.

Along the way, Aunt Jiyu kept protesting, “No! I’m not going back!”

By the time Clara carried Aunt Jiyu to her doorstep, she had quieted down, her head lolling to one side, her long hair half-covering her face, already deep in slumber.

Clara gently lifted Aunt Jiyu, finding that she had enough strength to carry multiple people if needed.

Just then, Aunt Jiyu, upon feeling Clara's touch, suddenly tightened her grip around Clara’s wrist, her eyes flashing with coldness. But when she recognized Clara, she murmured, “Oh, it’s you, little kitty~” and fell back asleep.

Clara didn’t mind Aunt Jiyu’s earlier expression; she figured that as a beautiful woman, it was only natural for her to have such vigilance. 

After placing Aunt Jiyu carefully in her room, Clara returned to the villa’s dining area. Upon seeing her, Adam looked at Clara as if she were a lifesaver, saying anxiously, “Boss Clara, please make sure Mr. Ethan doesn’t look at me like that! It’s terrifying!”

Clara also felt a bit scared but bravely stood by Ethan, thinking about Adam’s mental health. She sweetly said, “Mr. Ethan, it's time for you to go back and rest.”

She felt like a high-ranking maid beside an ancient monarch.

Turning to look at her, Ethan’s eyes were surprisingly beautiful. Clara had never studied him so closely. He looked like a star with a slight reflection in his eyes, his black pupils filled with a vast cosmos, making her feel like she could fall into them. His long eyelashes were not the kind that was curled but drooped slightly due to the alcohol, making him look innocent and easy to deceive. 

Seeing Ethan turn his head, Adam immediately bolted, shouting, “Thanks for saving me, Boss Clara!”

Clara ignored Adam, her heart inexplicably warm as she remembered the little version of Ethan from the meteor shower incident. 

“Mr. Ethan?” she gently called to confirm if he was truly drunk.

Ethan frowned, looking somewhat displeased. Just as Clara was about to apologize, he said childishly, “Don’t call me Mr. Ethan! Call me by my name!”

His voice lacked its usual deep resonance, now carryIng a youthful and rebellious tone, the last part rising slightly in pitch.

Clara confirmed that Ethan was indeed drunk and replied, “Alright, Ethan… How about I help you back to your room now?”

At first hesitating to call him by his name, she soon adapted; after all, calling his name was not the same as scolding him. Getting him into his room was the priority.

“Ugh! The Great Clara Wang, personal attendant, has arrived!” 

Ethan fixed his gaze on Clara, his chin slightly raised as if granting her mercy. He slowly nodded, saying, “Hmm.”

Clara couldn’t help but feel a little itch in her fists. Did he really think of her as a servant?

Whatever, she thought, shaking her head.

Clara pointed the way, and Ethan followed behind her, appearing more irritable than before.

This scene fell into Adam's vision, causing him to chuckle as he wrote in his thick notebook: 

*[December 16, 2075
   The untold story between the overbearing Ethan and Boss Clara after he got drunk…]*

As the official fan club president of the Ethan-Clara couple, he recorded the daily interactions of the two whenever he had time. 

After successfully getting Ethan into his room, Clara returned to her own room, barely had the energy to shower, dress, and rinse her hair.

Once done, she collapsed onto the bed as Jinbao the cat circled her, sniffing her with his little nose. Clara pulled Jinbao close, burying her face into his fur.

Ah~ Cuddling a cat is such a delight!

After a round of affection, Clara held Jinbao and fell into a deep sleep.

Meanwhile, Ethan, who had returned to his room earlier, snuck out in the middle of the night to head for A City.

At the same time, Sihou Yu was sound asleep when a sudden pain jolted him awake.

A dense fist struck, and Sihou Yu couldn't evade it. He simply lay there, bracing for the blows.

He already knew who it was and figured he couldn’t win anyway, so he just surrendered.

Tears of grievance welled in his eyes, wondering why it always had to be him…

After beating Sihou Yu, Ethan returned to his room feeling refreshed.

Aunt Jiyu opened her eyes for a second before closing them again, thinking that the old fellows in the council were truly unfortunate…

The next day, just before noon, Clara finally woke up, glancing at the clock to see it was 11:06. She rubbed her head as she sat up.

She had had quite a bit to drink last night, so her sleep was particularly deep; it was Jinbao licking her that stirred her awake.

Patting Jinbao's head, Clara’s voice was a bit hoarse as she said, “Jinbao, I’ll get your food ready in a moment~”

Feeling discomfort in her throat, Clara drank a cup of warm water from her space, which eased her throat a lot. She then got up to prepare her meal. Today, she wouldn’t cook; she was too hungry and decided to eat some of the pre-prepared dishes that she had stockpiled over the past few days.

As Clara washed up by the heater, she felt something was off. Why was it not as cold as before?

Previously, whenever she washed up next to the heater, the water would freeze within a minute; this time, after over two minutes, there was only a thin layer of ice on the surface.
