**Roast Chicken**

During this time, Kelly Wen had been training in the training room, re-establishing the foundation of various combat techniques taught to her by her master in the military. 

After the training, Kelly noticed that her tolerance to the cold had improved, and she no longer felt as chilly as before. 

Goldie, her pet, had also grown a lot. Previously only about three months old, Goldie was now around five months, and curiously, it had not shed its fur, which Kelly attributed to the cold weather. 

There were still three months left until the extreme cold period ended. 

The entire country had turned into a world of ice and snow, with the trees on the mountains resembling ice sculptures. Over a month ago, Kelly had already removed the surveillance alarms positioned behind the woods.

Because many animals had perished, only a few remained that wouldn’t easily provoke humans. 

“Goldie, bring it here!” 

Kelly sat cross-legged on the carpet, clapping her hands and calling to Goldie. 

Goldie sprang to his feet, leaped to catch the flying disc still in the air, and quickly returned it to Kelly, dropping it at her feet, ready for another throw. 

“Meow~” 

Kelly laughed and patted Goldie’s head, saying, “Good baby~” 

With that, she tossed the flying disc again, and Goldie darted after it once more. 

After a few rounds of play, Kelly finally said, “That’s enough for today; it’s time to eat.” 

Goldie obediently squatted on the carpet. 

“Meow~”

With his golden, fluffy fur and round, sparkling eyes focused on Kelly, she found herself enchanted by his adorably expressive face for what felt like the hundredth time. 

After hugging Goldie for a moment, Kelly began preparing lunch: Tomato Beef Rice Bowl. 

She threaded the tomatoes onto chopsticks and placed them over the fireplace to roast for a while, easily peeling off the skin once warmed. 

The peeled tomatoes were diced and placed in a bowl, after which she blanched a whole pack of beef rolls, skimming off the foam and setting them aside. 

Cleaning the pot, she poured in oil and heated it, then sautéed minced garlic until fragrant. Next, she added the diced tomatoes and sautéed them until they released juice, then added a generous amount of tomato sauce, stirring it a few times before pouring in water to bring to a boil. 

Once it boiled, she added salt, pepper, light soy sauce, enoki mushrooms, and the beef before simmering for a while, finally stirring in the rice and cooking on low heat until ready, garnished with chopped green onions. 

A fragrant bowl of Tomato Beef Rice was ready! 

Kelly inhaled the unique aroma of tomatoes, her appetite piqued. She also boiled some chicken breast for Goldie and prepared herself a cup of jasmine milk green tea, settling down at the table to dig in. 

Meanwhile, far beyond in space, Ethan Wei had been stranded outside Blue Star since arriving from the Central Star two months prior. 

The spatial coordinates of Blue Star had been blocked, preventing him from entering. Remembering the mission assigned by the Prince, Ethan couldn’t suppress his anxiety. 

Yet now, Blue Star felt like a fortress, impenetrable. 

After two months of waiting, Ethan finally sent a message to the Prince. 

“Beep—” 

Ethan opened his holographic device. 

[Return.] 

He pivoted and transmitted back to the Central Star.

At the same time, Jason Ji was perched on a tree behind Kelly’s villa, watching her eat, his brows furrowing slightly.

What is this woman doing, day after day, just eating?  

However, seeing how deliciously Kelly was indulging, Jason couldn’t help but feel curious about Blue Star’s food. 

Recalling the alluring scent from when Kelly grilled before, he leapt down and made his way deeper into the woods. Soon enough, he was carrying a chicken, striding toward Kelly’s villa. 

“Ahem—cough!” 

Kelly quickly grabbed her milk tea and gulped it down. Just then, she caught a glimpse of the surveillance feed, realizing that the psycho who had punched her two months ago was approaching her house.

Hastily, she put Goldie in the cage, afraid he might run down. She decided to head downstairs, eager to test her training’s effectiveness and hopefully exact revenge for that punch! 

“Creak—” 

The door opened. 

Kelly gazed at the man before her, a dangerous aura still emanating from him. 

“What do you want?” 

She hid her hand behind her back, ready to whip out a rocket launcher from her space pouch in case things turned hostile, feeling a gun wouldn’t suffice—better to be safe with a cannon. 

Jason stood outside the villa, backlit, exuding a dazzling yet cold light, with something dangling in his right hand. 

Kelly squinted. What was that? 

A chicken…?

Unbelievably, Kelly stared at the chicken in Jason’s hand, then back at him, her mouth twitching. 

Jason nonchalantly tossed the chicken at her feet, stating bluntly, “Barbecue.” 

Kelly feigned not hearing, rubbing her ears. 

“What did you say?” 

Jason’s irritation grew, contemplating if he should tear out her ears too… 

Too bad that wasn’t an option.

“Barbecue.” Jason reiterated, impatiently. 

An idea suddenly struck Kelly. Could he possibly want her to cook the barbecue? 

“You want me to grill it?” She pointed to herself, surprised. 

Jason nodded. 

With a smile, Kelly responded, “Alright then! I’ll grill it right away!” 

She stepped closer to Jason, bending down to grab the chicken. 

Just then!

Kelly swiftly pulled out her pre-prepared rocket launcher from her space pouch and aimed it at Jason, pulling the trigger. 

“Boom—” 

The blast from the close-range attack sent her hair blowing back, and Kelly triumphantly stared at the now-empty spot where Jason had stood, leaving only a big pit in the snow. 

“Shh~” 

Kelly whistled cheerfully, her spirits soaring! 

Finally, revenge was sweet! 

She picked up the chicken that Jason had dropped and skipped back into the villa, calling out to the direction where Jason had fled, “Thanks for the supplies, big guy!” 

Meanwhile, Jason wore a dark expression, smoke swirling around him. Though the rocket launcher didn’t inflict much damage, he hadn’t expected this woman to pull it out so casually… 

Choosing to remain silent, Jason changed his clothes, avoiding any attention as he stealthily made his way back to Kelly’s house, sidestepping all surveillance cameras. 

He peeked at Kelly happily grilling the chicken and couldn’t resist cracking his knuckles. Just as she turned around to feed Goldie, Jason quickly snatched the already grilled chicken using his space ring. 

Kelly returned after feeding Goldie, eyes widening in surprise. 

“Huh? Where’s my chicken?” 

Realization struck: it had to be that man! 

If only she had added more seasoning while grilling! 

Gritting her teeth, Kelly began preparing another meal. 

Back in his tree, Jason took out the roast chicken, hesitating for a moment before putting on gloves and tearing off a piece of meat. 

He sniffed it near his nose before popping it into his mouth. 

His expression remained stoic, yet the speed at which he devoured the chicken betrayed his delight. 

He hadn’t expected food from Blue Star to be this delicious! Finishing the first chicken quickly, he glanced toward Kelly’s villa, squinting slightly. 

Tsk… 

Maybe he should hold off on further action for now…
