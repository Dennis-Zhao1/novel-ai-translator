**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Feast**

After the excitement settled, Keke Wen glanced at the time and noted it was already half-past eleven. Remembering the amount they owed for Jie's and Fu's meal, she decided to treat them to hot pot for lunch today.

She started with the preparations, washing the vegetables thoroughly, chopping mushrooms into pieces, and setting aside the meats: beef tripe, tender beef, shrimp paste, lamb rolls, beef rolls, basa fish, crab sticks, fish balls, and the ever-popular slippery beef balls. 

Keke also put together some side dishes: crispy pork, sweet rice cakes, cooling jelly to offset the spiciness, and coconut milk.

For the broth, she pulled out her special spicy base from her storage space, recalling the spicy broth Jie had brought before, which suggested he could handle the heat. She opted not to prepare a tomato broth this time.

She made a small bowl of soup for Jinbao, her pet, by pan-frying a small carp, then adding some cat food to soak, along with some of Jinbao's favorite carrots. The little creature was happily slurping away.

Everything was ready, so Keke went downstairs to call Jie up for lunch. As she passed the stairwell door, she noticed Jie paused for a moment.

At the dining table, Keke smiled brightly and said, “This hot pot is way better than the last! I made the broth myself.” 

Jie looked at the spread and asked, “Is this what you call hot pot?”

Keke was puzzled; how could someone not know what hot pot was? But it wasn't her place to question it, so she simply nodded, “Yes, it’s called hot pot.” 

Jie's eyes lit up in understanding as he picked up a hefty amount of beef tripe with his chopsticks. Keke quickly followed suit, scooping up the rest of the tripe since it was her favorite!

After the meal, Keke leaned back in her chair, feeling pleasantly stuffed, while Jie slowly savored the cooling jelly for dessert. She couldn't help but think to herself how much Jie could eat! Coupled with his formidable fists, she'd think he could throw a punch too!

Lately, Keke had been busy with daily meal preparations and managing the inn. That evening, she administered a warming potion to Jinbao. Though Jinbao adapted well to the extreme cold, any relief was worth it.

Keke surveyed the layout of their property. The Wen family's villa sat at the mountain's peak, accessible only by one road. Surrounded by guardrails, their garden spanned about three hundred square meters, right beside the road.

Adjacent to the villa was a large golf course, also fronted by a road. Often, Keke would return home via the garden, but she considered that the road in front was actually shorter.

After some thought, she decided to build a few guesthouses right on the golf course. With the villa behind, guests wouldn’t bother her directly during their stays.

No sooner said than done; Keke took out her snowblower from her storage space. Since Jie also had a personal storage area, she had no fear of exposing her abilities.

Adding salt to the snowblower, she spent two days clearing the entire golf course of snow. Next, she retrieved iron railings from her space, driving to the side of the road to install them, leaving a large gate for truck access.

Once the iron railings were up, she got out a large iron plate and used a cutting machine to carve out four big characters: "Wen Nuan Inn" (温暖旅店). After painting it—white background with red letters—she mixed glow-in-the-dark agents into the paint.

The sign stood out beautifully against the white snow, further enhanced by colorful lights strung around the railings. Keke was delighted; what did it matter if swap batteries was a bit of a hassle? 

It seemed Jie anticipated that she might face issues. During lunch one day, he produced a round silver plate.

“What’s this?” Keke asked, intrigued by the unfamiliar item.

“It’s a household robot,” Jie replied with a nod.

Keke’s eyes sparkled as she trembled slightly, holding the silver circle, trying to figure out how to turn it on. “How does this work?”

Given Jie had been especially trustworthy lately – sharing gifts and enjoying meals together - her tone was familiar and friendly.

Jie pressed down in the center of the plate and held it for three seconds. The silver plate transformed into a small robot roughly the size of Jinbao.

“Greetings, Master. I am AI-3088 at your service. Please input your password,” it announced in a mechanical voice.

Keke looked at Jie, who gestured for her to place her hand on the robot’s head. She hesitated a moment before doing so.

“Password input complete,” the robot said.

Jie released her hand and explained, “It recognizes your fingerprint, meaning it will only respond to you. You can issue voice commands now.”

Keke snapped back to reality. “Oh! AI-3088, please go outside and change the batteries on the lights.”

“Command received,” it replied before walking towards the door.

Curious, Keke asked, “How does it recharge?”

Leaning back comfortably on the sofa, Jie responded, “No need to recharge; it will find its own energy sources—solar, wind, water, temperature, and more.”

Keke laughed cheerfully, “Thank you so much, Mr. Jie! You can stay here as long as you’d like!”

Jie simply nodded, “Sure.” 

Keke felt immensely satisfied with this arrangement. Given Jie’s generosity, she knew he would continue to offer more helpful items, and she was determined to return the favor with better meals!

With AI-3088 on her side, Keke found her tasks had become much easier. Now she just needed to construct the inn’s building. Everything else was ready.

Keke planned a trip to the city center, hoping to see if she could acquire a building to fit into her storage. If successful, her storage would replicate numerous structures, allowing her inn to expand tremendously.

When she mentioned this to Jie, to her surprise, he expressed his intention to join her on the trip to the city center.

Of course, Keke agreed; having Jie around ensured she would be safer given his impressive strength.

Early the next morning, she packed up, leaving a full day’s worth of cat food for Jinbao, instructing AI-3088 to look after him. She took out an SUV from her storage and parked it next to Jie, who, upon seeing it, wrinkled his nose in distaste.

Without hesitation, Jie produced a sleek interstellar vehicle from his own storage which drove itself. He simply needed to input the destination.

Curious, Keke examined the vehicle, which irked Jie slightly. “This is for you.”

Keke grinned mischievously. “Heh heh~”

She understood what he meant—he was telling her to hurry up and not waste time!
