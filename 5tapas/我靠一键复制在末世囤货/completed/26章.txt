**You Got into Tsinghua, I Roasted Sweet Potatoes**

After Xu Jin finished buying a house, he headed straight to the supermarket for a shopping spree. Meanwhile, Clara Joy was just about to return to her villa when Miss Ji Yu approached her.

Clara watched as Ji Yu walked with a graceful sway, her skirt dancing along with her movements as if she were a black lotus blooming in the snow—pure and isolated. 

Clara sighed and glanced down at herself. "Sigh..."

Ji Yu curiously looked around the supermarket. She recognized the machines at the entrance; after all, they existed in the stars as well. However, she pondered about the machines on the left—what was roasted sweet potato? She was familiar with milk tea, the drink usually consumed at meals.

Noticing Ji Yu's curiosity, Clara took the initiative to speak up, "Miss Ji, would you like to try a roasted sweet potato?"

"Sure!" Ji Yu replied enthusiastically.

She playfully pinched Clara's cheek, making her delicate features appear even more pronounced. Ji Yu's flawless complexion was enviable, lacking even a single blemish.

Clara was already used to Ji Yu's spontaneous affection. However, she found herself zoning out, and when she regained focus, she saw Ji Yu standing in front of the points redemption machine.

Ji Yu took out a large piece of gold, about the size of a fist, from her storage bracelet and placed it on the machine.

"Beep! Detecting—

Redeemable Points: 18,800 points

Have a wonderful day!"

Clara's eyes widened; this was the first time she had seen a piece of gold that large! 

Ji Yu exchanged points and directly went to the roasted sweet potato machine, which sensed her presence.

"You got into Tsinghua, he got into Peking University, I roasted sweet potatoes, eating sweet potatoes, eating sweet potatoes, no going home in this cold weather~
Hello, madam! Would you like a roasted sweet potato?"

A strange mechanical voice chimed in. 

A selection button appeared on the screen: [Need] or [Do Not Need].
Clara's face turned red; she had initially set this slogan to lighten the mood but felt embarrassed in front of Ji Yu.

Ji Yu burst out laughing, her beauty glowing like the sunset, as though a drop of water had fallen onto an everlasting ice, bringing a sudden sense of spring, making everything bloom.

"Hehe, you really are adorable, little kitty!" Ji Yu giggled, pressing the 'Need' button.

"Beep—Your roasted sweet potato!
Points Deducted: 1 point
Remaining Points: 18,799 points"

A box of packaged roasted sweet potatoes emerged from the machine. 

The sweet, fragrant aroma wafted through the air, prompting Ji Yu to quickly retrieve it. 

Upon opening the box, she found a perfectly peeled golden roasted sweet potato and a spoon inside. 

Ji Yu gently scooped some with the spoon; the tender sweet potato came away effortlessly. 

As she tasted it, she marveled at the delicate, smooth texture—sweet but not overly so, a delightful kind of sweetness that lifted her spirits.

Very satisfied with this roasted sweet potato, she bought another 100.

"You got into Tsinghua, he got into Peking University, I roasted sweet potatoes, eating sweet potatoes, eating sweet potatoes, no going home in this cold weather~
Hello, madam! Would you like a roasted sweet potato?"

Ji Yu pressed the [Need] button once more.

"Beep—Your roasted sweet potatoes!
Points Deducted: 100 points
Remaining Points: 18,699 points"

After storing all the sweet potatoes into her bracelet, Ji Yu walked back towards the supermarket.

Meanwhile, Clara noticed an array of sounds coming from the machines.

"Beep—Your potato chips
Points Deducted: 1 point
Remaining Points: 18,698 points"

"Beep—Your cola

Remaining Points: 18,697 points"

"Beep—
..."

Clara thought to herself: Is Miss Ji going to buy everything repeatedly?

Just then, Xu Jin emerged, looking satisfied, and greeted Clara at the door before heading back to his new house. He had just bought a lot of items and was eager to decorate his new place!

"Meow~" Clara looked down to find Jinbao. Ever since drinking the temperature-adapting potion, Jinbao was no longer afraid of the cold and loved rolling around in the snow, returning home covered in white.

"Oh my, Jinbao!" Clara cooed, bending down to pick him up.

Jinbao nestled in Clara's arms, wagging his little tail contentedly.

In the distance, Ji He observed this scene of Clara and the cat slowly walking through the snow, imprinting it in his memory.

Ji He turned his head to the kneeling figure beside him and asked, "So… the Blue Star Plan has been accelerated?"

The person kneeling on the ground trembled as they replied, "Yes, master. We detected that Elder Sikou Zhen from the House of Representatives is initiating Blue Star Plan B."

The so-called Blue Star Plan A was the regular process, Plan B was for accelerated implementation, and Plan C was to halt the plan altogether.

Ji He glanced somberly toward City A, his hair billowing in the wind as his aura suggested anger.

In City A, Elder Sikou Yu couldn't help but shiver.

Why does it feel a bit chilly?

Sikou Yu shook his head, thinking it was probably because the acceleration of Plan B had influenced the weather.

Clara returned to her villa, preparing dinner for the evening. She had seen how delicious Ji Yu found the roasted sweet potato earlier, which made her crave some too, so she decided to make cheese baked sweet potatoes tonight.

With four people to feed, including two big eaters, Clara prepared five sweet potatoes the size of small arms.

First, she peeled the sweet potatoes and cut them into large chunks, steaming them over high heat until cooked. Then, she mashed the cooked sweet potatoes in a large bowl, mixing in butter, a bit of sugar, and milk.

After stirring it all together, she topped it with loads of shredded cheese and placed it in the oven at 200 degrees for 15 minutes.

Of course, they wouldn’t just have baked sweet potatoes for dinner; Clara planned to prepare a platter of marinated delicacies and a dish of twice-cooked pork.

She boiled the chicken feet, wings, duck wings, duck necks, and quail eggs, then prepared vegetables like seaweed, potato slices, and lotus roots until they were tender, combining them all in a large pot.

Next, she added green onions, Sichuan pepper, star anise, cinnamon, bay leaves, dried chilies, along with soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, a tablespoon of yellow bean paste, rock sugar, and a bottle of beer, followed by enough water to cover the ingredients.

After bringing it to a boil, she turned the heat down to simmer for forty minutes. While the marinated delicacies brewed, Clara moved onto the twice-cooked pork.

She diced onions and bell peppers, cut garlic shoots into sections, and minced some garlic.

Starting with a piece of pork belly, she boiled it in cold water with a splash of cooking wine, boiling it for twenty minutes.

At this moment, the cheese baked sweet potatoes were ready, and Clara placed them in the warming box.

After slicing the boiled pork belly into pieces, she added a dash of oil to the pan, frying the pork until golden before removing it.

In the same pan, she sautéed the minced garlic until fragrant, then added the pork belly, a tablespoon of doubanjiang, a tablespoon of soy sauce, a tablespoon of oyster sauce, half a tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and a pinch of sugar and chicken essence.

After stirring it all until evenly mixed, she tossed in the onions, bell peppers, and garlic shoots, sautéing a bit longer until the vegetables were fully cooked.

By this time, the marinated delicacies were nearly ready. The enticing aroma wafted through the air, reaching Xu Jin in the adjacent building. Without needing Ji He to remind him, he instinctively stepped into the kitchen to help serve.

"Boss Clara, your cooking smells amazing!" Xu Jin breathed in the delightful scent.

It's been a long time since he had this kind of marinated food; he figured it would pair well with some drinks. Luckily, he had bought a few bottles at the supermarket earlier and planned to bring them out soon!
