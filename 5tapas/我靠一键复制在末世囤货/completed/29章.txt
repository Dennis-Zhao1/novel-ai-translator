**Chapter Title: A Bountiful Discovery**

As preparations for the evacuation plan moved rapidly in City A, the atmosphere in City S was quite different for Clara Wen.

“Right, put more here!” Clara directed her assistant, Emily, to place thick sandbags along the road.

The snow had finally stopped, and temperatures were slowly rising, hovering around zero degrees Celsius—just bearable for human comfort. Clara was determined to put in place flood prevention measures. After all, this world had changed so much that she wanted to avoid any unexpected circumstances.

First, she needed to recall the flood levels from her previous life. The extreme cold this time lasted only about three months, resulting in two months less snowfall. Therefore, the flood line would undoubtedly be much lower than in her previous experience.

Clara decided to build a line of sandbags directly along the previous flood line. This would be just the first line of defense; she had plenty of cement and gravel in her storage. Her plan was to construct a significant flood barrier around the mountain.

Although she wasn’t an expert in this area, Clara could reach out to the city for help—there must be some professionals available! She was ready to provide all the necessary materials, allowing others to focus on constructing the barriers. Additionally, many robots were made by the company Starfall, which meant she could input instructions directly, saving manpower.

To conserve the materials in her storage, Clara planned to make another trip to the city soon to gather resources like gold, silver, iron, and copper. She didn’t want the Starfall robots dismantling her little assistant, Emily; it broke her heart.

After completing the first line of sandbags, it was the third day since the snow had stopped, and Clara prepared to head to the city to collect resources. Max Lee didn’t want to go either; he felt he would just slow the group down.

Tai Shu Jiyu and Ethan Zhou insisted on joining her, so Clara had no choice but to bring them along. However, upon examining their outfits, she found them rather mismatched. Pulling out two sets of suitable clothing from her storage, she tentatively asked, “How about changing into these outfits? They’re a bit more... fitting.”

Ethan was indifferent to the idea and nodded, taking the clothes to change. Tai Shu Jiyu browsed through what Clara had offered—a red velvet slip dress and a short black trench coat—and liked the look enough to take them both.

When Ethan stepped out in his new outfit, Clara was pleasantly surprised. The black dress trousers showcased his long legs perfectly, complemented by a medieval-style shirt and vest. The matching coat completed the look, giving him the air of a sophisticated gentleman straight out of an oil painting, hinting at both charm and a touch of danger.

Clara had chosen this outfit for Ethan, believing it suited him perfectly, and her instincts were spot on!

Tai Shu Jiyu appeared next, almost stealing the breath from Clara’s lungs; the red dress matched beautifully against the backdrop of the snowy landscape, a stunning rose in a sparkling frost. Her long, pale legs peeked through the fabric, and the coat provided a captivating contrast, revealing just enough of the red beneath.

With her dark hair, fair skin, and vivid red lips, Tai Shu Jiyu was a mesmerizing sight—a perfect blend of queenly authority and enticing allure.

Clara couldn’t help but sigh, admiring the stunning beauty before her.

Once everyone was ready, Clara retrieved the starship from her storage. Tai Shu Jiyu cast a knowing glance at Ethan, who remained expressionless, staring straight ahead. 

Pfft! Such pretense! Trying to charm my little kitty!

With all the machinery around Clara now under Starfall’s control, she no longer needed to input commands. Instead, she simply informed Starfall.

“Master, we have located the area with the most resources. Estimated arrival in six minutes.”

Clara looked at the resource point displayed on the screen, her lips twitching slightly. Indeed, the resource density was high—it was the largest gold store in City S!

Upon arrival, Clara waved her hand to collect all the gold jewelry into her storage, including a small silver figurine from a nearby display. After all, it was a resource!

Then, she had a thought and turned back to grab the display case itself—it was quite lovely, after all. With that secured, they moved to the second floor, which was filled with jade stones.

Starfall exclaimed, “Master! These stones are Serenity Stones!”

Clara raised an eyebrow, puzzled about how she could detect excitement from Starfall’s otherwise monotonous robotic voice. “You mean these jades?” she asked, holding a piece in her palm. 

It was extremely cold, likely due to the frigid air around them.

“Yes, master! These stones share identical energies with the Serenity Stones—perhaps even more refined!”

Clara was taken aback; she had never expected the jade to possess such potent qualities. Back on Blue Star, it was said that jade had nurturing properties—was this truly a form of an interstellar Serenity Stone?

Regardless, she decided to collect them all, waving her hand to gather them, cabinet included.

As they entered the storage area, Tai Shu Jiyu and Ethan followed closely. Tai Shu Jiyu was astounded; she hadn’t imagined Blue Star contained so many Serenity Stones. No wonder those people in the Council had taken notice of this planet before the activation of the Ming bloodline.

Though shocked internally, Tai Shu Jiyu maintained her calm exterior. After all, all these treasures belonged to her little kitty.

Standing before a large, five-centimeter-thick iron door, excitement flickered in Clara's eyes as she boldly stepped forward. “Let me take care of this!” she announced.

With a swift kick, the door crumbled inward, unleashing a blast of cold air that sent Clara shivering. Ethan instinctively stepped forward to shield her, causing Tai Shu Jiyu to retract her foot just in time.

Once the icy gust subsided, Clara emerged from behind Ethan, peering into the warehouse.

Wow!

The entire area was the size of a basketball court, meticulously arranged with an array of gold and silver jewelry, alongside numerous jade bangles and pendants of various styles.

Despite her affluent background, Clara had never seen such a vast collection all at once. If this had been before the apocalypse, she would have struck gold!

With glee, Clara examined everything, wearing a greedy expression. Observing her, Tai Shu Jiyu couldn’t help but find her endearing and leaned closer to speak, “If you like these, my home is filled with such treasures—everything can be yours!”

Her entire family’s wealth spread across the entire Ailan star system, and if Clara fancied them, she could have them all to play with.

Ethan's gaze flickered for the first time, although he remained silent.

“We don’t need to, really!” Clara waved her hands in panic. “I’m just surprised to see so much all at once!”

Once she placed all the treasures into her storage, she would own an endless amount in just days! Heehee!
