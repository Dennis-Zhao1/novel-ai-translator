**The Unlucky Sikai Yu**

*Cough... cough cough*

From beneath the rubble, the Grand Elder Sikai Zhen and the Third Elder Sikai Yu crawled out, covered in soot, their hair in disarray. 

Looking around at the interstellar media that had rushed to the scene, they hurriedly used a spatial communicator to return to the Sikai family estate, only to be greeted by a vacant house with bare walls.

“Where is everyone?! Where have they all gone?!” The Grand Elder shouted at the empty space.

From a patch of grass, a man crawled out – the Sikai family's steward.

“G… Grand Elder…” 

The steward trembled as he spoke.

“What is going on? Where are all the belongings?” 

The Grand Elder restrained his anger, trying to maintain a calm tone.

“W… well, Grand Elder, everything in the house… has been taken away by the Star Tower people… they left a message...” 

The steward suddenly dropped to his knees, bowing his head to the ground.

The Grand Elder closed his eyes, suppressing the rage bubbling within him. “What did they say?”

With a defiant air, the steward responded, “They said, 'Isn’t the Sikai family fond of stealing things? I wonder if the Red Crystals will suffice as compensation...'”

The Grand Elder burst into laughter through his fury, “Very good!!! Hahahaha!!! Very good! Ji… He!”

As he spoke the latter part, the Grand Elder gritted his teeth with resentment. 

The Third Elder shrank back, knowing how furious his elder brother was, he dared not show himself.

“Steward, how long have you been with the Sikai family?” The Grand Elder asked the kneeling steward.

Hearing this, the steward trembled even more, his voice shaking as he replied, “Grand Elder, it’s… been five and a half years…”

“Five and a half years...” The Grand Elder mumbled, narrowing his eyes. 

“It’s time for you to make a contribution to the Sikai family…”

With that, the Grand Elder pulled out a vial of medicine from his spatial ring and jabbed it into the kneeling steward’s body. The steward didn’t have the chance to say a word before his body rapidly dried up, turning into a desiccated corpse.

The wind picked up, scattering the remains into the air. 

On the ground where the steward once knelt, a red, circular object emerged. 

The Grand Elder picked it up and placed it into a transparent vial, watching as the liquid gradually turned crimson. He sighed, “Another perfect potion!”

Unknown to him, a household robot nearby recorded everything.

The Third Elder crouched behind the Grand Elder, doing his best to remain unseen.

“Old Three!” The Grand Elder’s voice cut through the tension.

The Third Elder’s body shook, a look of despair on his face, “B… Brother!”

The Grand Elder cast a glance at the Third Elder, “Look at you... We’re heading to the Oracle Institute.”

The Third Elder’s eyes widened in shock, “Brother, the Oracle Institute?”

Their relationship with the Oracle Institute had always been strained; last time they were fined so many Red Crystals. Why did his brother want him to go there...?

The Grand Elder turned away, marching off, “Hurry up! Stop talking nonsense!”

The Third Elder instantly fell silent, not daring to continue the conversation, and hurried after him toward the Oracle Institute.

On the way, the Third Elder couldn’t hold back any longer, “Brother… why aren’t we taking a car?”

The Grand Elder paused, a moment of embarrassment flashing in his eyes, but he quickly turned to the Third Elder, barking angrily, “You know what to do, hurry and pull it out!”

The Third Elder felt wronged as he retrieved the interstellar vehicle from his spatial ring, realizing it was just tagging along... All the burdens fell on him again...

**On Blue Star**

Wen Keke was enjoying a meal in Beibei’s small abode, reveling in the bliss of having her hands free from cooking; it was wonderful to eat so many delicious dishes without any effort! 

Savoring a bite of the delightful hamburger before her, she exclaimed, “Ah! So satisfying!”

Opposite her, Ji He was absent-mindedly fiddling with a newly acquired spatial ring, contemplating how to gift it to Wen Keke. 

Noticing his distracted demeanor, Wen Keke swallowed her bite and asked, “What’s wrong with you?”

Has he changed? The hamburger in front of him hadn’t been touched at all, nor had he drunk his favorite cola. 

After a moment of hesitation, Ji He decided to be direct, extending his hand towards Wen Keke, revealing the spatial ring in his palm. 

Wen Keke initially looked startled, “What’s this for?”

“For the rent,” Ji He said bluntly.

Rent? 

Though puzzled as to why Ji He was giving her something again, she thought, “Why not take advantage of a good deal, heh heh heh!” 

“Heh heh heh, thank you!”

Ji He looked a bit displeased, “Don’t say thank you to me.”

Wen Keke, though unclear on why someone wouldn’t like politeness, still adhered to Ji He’s wish, “Then? No thanks?”

Ji He nodded, “Mm!”

Wen Keke couldn’t help but smile; Ji He’s earnest nodding made him resemble a golden retriever, making her want to pet his fur. 

She took the spatial ring, opened it, and found it stuffed with an impressive pile of red crystals, somewhat translucent, with what appeared to be a flowing liquid inside; it was breathtaking.

“Master! Master!!! So many Red Crystals!!!!” Starfall, the AI assistant, exclaimed excitedly.

Wen Keke was puzzled, “What’s Red Crystal?”

Starfall explained, “Red Crystal is the universally accepted currency in the four major star systems. It serves as transactional currency in the universe and also as an energy resource; many ordinary folks use Red Crystals to build spaceships, but the performance cannot compare to those built from Magma Stones.”

Wen Keke’s eyes lit up—wasn’t this just money? If she stored it in her spatial ring, wouldn’t that mean she had endless money? 

Oh my goodness! She hit the jackpot!

But...

“Starfall, can this be used as a substitute for Magma Stones?” Wen Keke inquired.

“It can, but it would take several times more Red Crystals than for Magma Stones. Are you sure you want to proceed?” Starfall replied.

“Absolutely! Let’s use it. How long will it take?” Wen Keke confirmed eagerly.

The sooner it was ready, the sooner she could deal with those troublesome people...

“Master, it should take about a week to complete!” Starfall joyfully added.

It loved creating things!

Wen Keke smiled, while Ji He remained quiet, having listened the entire time without any reaction.

After all, he was the one who initially told her that Starfall could create positioning weapons.

These so-called positioning weapons were not just limited to their literal meaning. The weapons created by Starfall could not only precisely locate a person from miles away but also analyze what that person feared the most, ensuring that the weapon would eliminate them in their worst way possible. 

Moreover, these weapons could be used indefinitely, and once used, they could still be employed again. Of course, Wen Keke planned to modify the weapon after she dealt with the people who caused the apocalypse.

The apocalypse hadn’t only been caused by humans; it was also due to a control device brought by those outsiders, controlling Blue Star and summoning disasters as they pleased.

Thus, Wen Keke’s ultimate goal was to destroy that control device, leaving the tormentors to deal with the consequences.
