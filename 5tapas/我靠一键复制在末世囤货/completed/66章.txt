**Chapter 7: Waiting in the Rain**

Everything seemed to make sense now. Based on the contents of the diary, it was clear that Gina was deeply in love with Ethan. She had progressed from hopeful anticipation to deep affection, but with the lengthy wait for pregnancy and Sugars’ increasing communication with Ethan over desserts, things had taken a turn. 

As a patient diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder, Gina's extreme actions could be somewhat understood.

“So the killer is Ethan’s wife, Gina?” Mia pondered, stroking her chin.

Now, Wendy and Jaxon had returned to Mia’s original home, where Wendy shared all the known information with her.

“But what about that shadow we saw last night…?” Wendy hesitated, feeling uneasy but unable to pinpoint why.

“Maybe that shadow was Ethan?” Mia suggested. “You see, if the killer is really Gina, then all the evidence is laid bare, which means Ethan must have deliberately left it out to cover up Gina’s guilt. Now he’s confessing to protect her.”

“Then where would the first crime scene be…?” Wendy mused, lost in thought. She couldn’t understand how Gina, a seemingly fragile woman, could have killed Sugars, Yvonne, and Lucy.

“The first crime scene doesn’t matter! Perhaps Gina wanted to torment someone who was close to her husband?” Mia replied excitedly. “Plus, think about it: all the bodies were sawed with such efficiency. Usually, those with a penchant for dismemberment enjoy the process. This, however, shows a lack of strength, suggesting a female killer. And Sugars’ expression before she died was so full of disbelief. If the killer is indeed Gina, it makes sense; imagine being killed by a woman who looks so gentle.”

Mia explained excitedly to Wendy.

“What about Yvonne? She was killed in the yard. There’s no way there wasn’t a sound!” Wendy countered.

“Wendy, didn’t you read Yvonne’s autopsy report? She was incapacitated before being dismembered and placed in the yard. It completely makes sense if the killer was Gina,” Mia educated her in surprise.

Wendy fell silent. It seemed she hadn’t actually looked at the autopsy since the gruesome details of Sugars’ report had left her feeling nauseous.

Anticipating Wendy’s next question, Mia continued: “Lucy was suffocated in a car with someone strangling her from behind before being dismembered. Even a child could manage that, so Gina could easily fit the profile of the killer.”

Wendy was swayed by Mia's argument. After all, Gina's diary did contain some erratic thoughts, indicating signs of mental illness.

“Then the killer must be Gina,” Wendy nodded decisively.

“Hey, we’re almost finished with our game, but why haven’t we seen Miss Ji and Xu yet?” Mia asked, noticing that while she, Wendy, and Jaxon had already met up, there was still no sign of Xu and the enigmatic Ji Yu.

“Maybe they are off on another task?” Wendy suggested.

“Speaking of which, what are your tasks?” Jaxon inquired.

“Finding the killer,” he replied.

“Me too!” Mia chimed in excitedly.

It seemed they all had the same task…

Just as Wendy was lost in thought, Mia suddenly wrapped her arms around her.

“Ugh, I feel like I haven’t contributed at all to this game, and now it’s ending,” she lamented.

“It’s okay. Next time, I’ll play along with you so you can find the clues,” Wendy reassured her.

“Mm-hmm!” Mia nodded, feeling comforted.

With the identity of the killer somewhat clearer, Wendy organized her materials for Jaxon to submit to the police officer he knew.

On the fourth day of the game, which was the penultimate day for finding the killer, Ethan was released without charges while Gina was sent to a psychiatric hospital.

On the night of the fifth day, which was a Tuesday, Wendy prepared for rest in the dormitory, just like before, marking the end of her gameplay.

The door opened as Qian returned, collapsing onto her bed without continuing her studies as usual. Wendy guessed she must have known about Ethan's wife willingly opting for prison.

Shortly thereafter, Gao Xiaoxing and Tang Lu entered. Gao Xiaoxing shot Wendy a glance, signaling her to not disturb the class monitor. Wendy understood and remained quiet.

“Ding ling ling—”

Gao Xiaoxing's phone rang, and she moved to the balcony to answer it.

“Hello, Mom?”

“Xiaoxing, are you coming to see your sister this weekend? She misses you so much!”

Gao Xiaoxing's tone shifted sharply: “I’m not going! I’m not going! How many times do I have to say it? I don’t have a sister! Don’t call me again! I’m going to sleep now.”

“Beep—beep—beep.”

After hanging up, Gao Xiaoxing returned to the dorm, looking upset as she sat on her bed, staring blankly at her phone screen.

Wendy ensured she hadn’t intentionally eavesdropped; after all, her bed was right next to the balcony, and Gao Xiaoxing was her lower bunkmate.

Wendy caught a glimpse and thought briefly, “Hmm?”

Wendy quickly sat up, causing Gao Xiaoxing to jump in surprise and ask, “Xiao Yu, what’s wrong?”

Wendy climbed down from her bunk, her expression somber as she asked, “Is your sister Gina? The wife of Dr. Lin?”

Gao Xiaoxing, taken aback by Wendy's sudden intensity, stared wide-eyed before nodding, “Y-yes, she is…”

“And what about the mole on her hand?” Wendy pressed further.

Earlier, she had seen a photo on Gao Xiaoxing’s phone of a woman with a big smile, her arm resting on Gao Xiaoxing’s shoulder—Gina—mirroring the pose Ethan had taken. But the mole was missing.

“My sister has no mole! She never had one!” Gao Xiaoxing denied vehemently.

No mole? How could that be…

Then, who was that woman in the villa photo?

Wendy paced anxiously, deep in thought, which caught Qian's attention.

“Mole… Sugars had a mole on her hand…” Qian murmured, darkening as a sudden realization struck her.

Wendy turned abruptly, flinging open the door as she dashed outside.

She understood now!

She finally grasped why she recognized the mole on Gina’s hand; the mole on Sugars’ wrist was identical to the one Gina had displayed in that photo, in both size and position.

She knew what was going on!

It was all fake! Everything was a lie!

“Jaxon, go pick up Mia from the villa where Ethan lives. I'm on my way there now!” Wendy shouted into her phone.

“Okay, but be careful,” Jaxon replied from the other end.

Wendy hung up and immediately flagged down a taxi, relieved to see the friendly driver from before.

“Driver, take me to Jinlin Garden,” she said, naming Ethan’s residential area.

The driver wanted to greet her as usual, but upon seeing her anxious expression, he merely pressed the gas pedal, pondering how he kept running into this girl at odd hours.
