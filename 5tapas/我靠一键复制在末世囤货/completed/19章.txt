**Intelligent Butler Weapon - Starfall**

The virtual barrel of the cannon flashed, and in an instant, a miniature version of Ethan Zhou appeared, rendered as a 3D hologram.  
It was about the size of a hand, with long hair floating in mid-air, dressed in a trench coat and long boots just like Ethan's. The delicate features, now shrunk, lost some of their devilish charm and gained a touch of cuteness.  
No! It was much more than just a touch of cuteness!  
Clara Joy glanced at the palm-sized hologram of Ethan, bursting into laughter.  
"Hahahahaha!"  
She wasn't trying to laugh on purpose; it was just the thought of Ethan’s usual expression compared to the miniature version in front of her that struck her as wildly contrasting, making her feel as if Ethan himself were right there looking like this.  
Starfall, with curiosity, looked at Clara: "Master, why are you laughing? Starfall compared all information across the galaxy, and Master Ethan's features are ranked the finest in the entire star system."  
Starfall didn't understand; many girls in the galaxy adored Master Ethan's face, and he had won first place in the vote for the most handsome man in the galaxy.  
Clara caught the essential detail: "Ranked in the galaxy?"  
Starfall nodded in Ethan's likeness: "Yes."  
"What galaxy?" Clara's heart sank. She wasn't unfamiliar with novels; could it be that Ethan was an alien? Not the researcher she thought he was?  
No wonder he possessed such terrifying power…  
Suddenly, the apocalypse had struck Blue Star, advanced intelligent weapons emerged, and there was Ethan, an alien…  
Everything seemed connected…  
Could it be… that the apocalypse was related to Ethan? Clara tried to imagine Ethan's appearance again, but it seemed implausible…  
Even though they hadn’t spent much time together, from what she gathered, Ethan was the type to act directly without regard for consequences.  
If he wanted to destroy Earth, he could probably do it with just one punch, taking everyone out, especially with the potent serums and weapons he had that earth lacked.  
"Master, we are in the Elysium Galaxy!" Starfall’s proud mechanical voice sounded beside her.  
Clara shook her head, deciding not to dwell on these thoughts for now; pondering wouldn’t help. The fact that she was in a world with aliens was already overwhelming…  
Returning to her senses, she looked at Starfall, her eyes sparkling with excitement: "So, there are other galaxies?"  
Starfall nodded: "Yes, Master! There are also the Evertrack Galaxy, Moonlight Galaxy, and Mech Haven Galaxy, but the four major galaxies are separated by vast distances, so they don't communicate often."  
Clara realized that aliens were categorized by galaxies…  
"Ethan said you are an intelligent butler weapon. What does that mean?"  
Deciding to put aside the intergalactic information for now, which felt far away, she thought it more relevant to understand her immediate reality. Besides, knowing too much could just add to her troubles.  
Starfall became excited upon hearing Clara’s question, proudly explaining:  
"Starfall is the only intelligent butler weapon in the Elysium Galaxy! The butler weapons on the market are manufactured by the Seidel family, equipped with energy stones that need to be replaced when they run out.  
Starfall’s body is crafted from starstone by Master Ethan, making it the only butler weapon that doesn't require energy replacement!  
As long as you wish, Starfall can transform into any weapon you need, and it's not just limited to weapons; it can be used infinitely!  
Moreover, Starfall can analyze anything to determine their weaknesses; any information that Starfall has not recorded is information Starfall does not know. Starfall can also connect to all intelligent devices and command them!  
And Starfall possesses the universe's strongest defensive capabilities; no attack can penetrate Starfall’s protection!"  
Clara's eyes widened. Judging by this, Starfall was extraordinarily impressive—  
Ethan gave this to her?  
Clara felt even more reassured that Ethan had no ties to Earth’s apocalypse!  
How could someone as wonderful as Ethan entertain thoughts of world destruction?  
Yet, seeing Starfall still sporting Ethan’s appearance, Clara couldn’t help but remark:  
"Starfall, what did you originally look like? Please revert back."  
Starfall obediently replied, "Alright, Master!"  
Starfall transformed from the miniature version of Ethan into a rectangular virtual screen, featuring a simple pair of eyes and a mouth.  
Clara found the current appearance of Starfall much more pleasant. Indeed, a person shouldn’t try to be too quirky; it just leads to being alone!  
"Master, do you have any other questions?" Starfall inquired.  
"Not at the moment," Clara shook her head.  
Just then, she suddenly thought, "Starfall, please connect with Little Ai 3088 and bring it back."  
With Starfall around, she didn't need to call for Little Ai herself!  
"Okay, Master. Connecting now. Connection complete; Little Ai 3088 is on its way back."  
Starfall responded.  
Before long, Little Ai returned from the library, where all the underfloor heating had already been installed.  
Clara looked at Little Ai in front of her, a sly grin forming as she prepared to implement her earlier idea: "Hehehe~"  
She tried to take Little Ai into her space, and to her surprise, it worked; now all that was left was to see if there would be two identical Little Ais by tomorrow. Clara then turned her gaze back to Starfall on her left wrist…  
Could Starfall also be brought into her space?  
“Ding— Data analysis in process! Alert! Analysis failed! Analysis failed!”  
"Master, your space cannot be analyzed by Starfall," Starfall replied, its mechanical voice tinged with mild disappointment.  
After all, Starfall had just vowed to analyze anything; now it faced something it couldn’t analyze. Though merely an AI, Starfall felt a bit embarrassed…  
Clara was astonished; Starfall, who seemed so capable, couldn't analyze her own space?  
Her space was that impressive?  
Clara comforted Starfall: "It's alright, no need to analyze. That’s someone close to me!"  
Starfall obediently answered, "Okay, Master."  
Clara glanced at the time; it was already past noon. She stood up and headed to the kitchen to prepare the hot pot that Ethan wanted.  
Days passed, and Clara had managed to replicate eight Little Ais in the space, but she still only took out the original version, as she couldn't explain why so many identical Little Ais had appeared.  
The buildings in her space had grown to sixteen, and Clara had placed ten at the site designated for the Warm Stay Inn, with six of them adjacent to the supermarket and four on the opposite side, next to the library.  
While still in the space, Clara had arranged the external glass and heating system for the buildings, and every unit was equipped with beds, tables, and chairs. In this space, she could effortlessly create many things with just a thought—hardly exhausting at all.  
As a result, the replicated buildings came equipped and renovated, saving a lot of effort.  
At present, the hardware of the Warm Stay Inn was considered complete!  
Now, all she needed was for people to arrive so that she could install the software facilities.  
Xu Jin had been spending the last few days in his room, facilitating Clara's work on the building layout for the inn.  
After experiencing the apocalypse, Xu Jin had become much more easygoing. His days revolved around eating, sleeping, or watching shows on the iPad Clara had given him, filled with a plethora of dramas, variety shows, and movies.  
Before the apocalypse, he had always been too busy with work to enjoy anything; now, he realized how dull his prior life had been.  
This was what he called living!
