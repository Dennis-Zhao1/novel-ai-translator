**There Are Really Stars**

Wen Keke took out the rings she had collected earlier from the attic of the villa and placed them side by side on the table. One was her own, and the other was from Tai Shu Ji Yu. Looking at the almost identical rings, she felt she was beginning to understand something...

Could her mother possibly have an impressive identity?

Tai Shu Ji Yu explained to Wen Keke, “This ring is a symbol of the Tai Shu family’s identity. Every female born into the Tai Shu family possesses a unique jade ring. Yours...”

Tai Shu Ji Yu picked up Wen Keke's ring, examining it closely. “This one should belong to the Wan Courtyard branch of the family. The Tai Shu family is divided into Wan Courtyard, Ji Courtyard, Kai Courtyard, and Ying Courtyard. The Wan and Ji Courtyards are for the prospective candidates for the royal family, while the other two courtyards are for ordinary relatives of the Tai Shu family. Each prospective candidate's jade ring can sense the presence of other candidates, which is why I went to Blue Star. As far as I remember, the only incumbent prospective candidate who is not within the family is Tai Shu Wanqing from over twenty years ago.”

Tai Shu Wanqing, the name of her mother...

Wen Keke realized that her mother must be related to the Ji sister’s family.

“So, you...”

“I am, according to the bloodlines on Blue Star, your cousin, little kitty~” Tai Shu Ji Yu smiled.

“Sister...” Wen Keke murmured.

“Do you know where my mother is now?” Wen Keke asked eagerly.

“Sorry, little kitty. Since the ring is with you, I can’t sense her,” Tai Shu Ji Yu replied regretfully.

“That’s alright!” Wen Keke smiled brightly, having asked in excitement; it was impossible for her mother to be sensed through the ring being in her possession. 

“By the way, little kitty, let’s go to the Clearing Pool later to activate your Tai Shu bloodline,” Tai Shu Ji Yu suggested.

Although Wen Keke didn’t understand what the Clearing Pool was, she grasped that activating bloodlines was important. Ah He had told her before that she had the bloodline of Mang, which she likely inherited from her father, so she wasn’t too surprised to hear about the Tai Shu bloodline.

“Okay.”

Just then, their hovering vehicle arrived at the palace gates. Wen Keke had imagined the palace would have a majestic traditional Chinese style; however, what appeared before her was something entirely different.

Golden barriers floated in the air. Ji Yu stated that this was the palace's protective shield, which even the most advanced interstellar weapon could not breach.

The entire palace exuded a European style. Wen Keke followed Tai Shu Ji Yu through the gardens and long corridors until they reached a grand door.

Ji He stopped outside because, being male, he could not enter.

Tai Shu Ji Yu pushed open the large door, revealing a massive pool inside, seemingly naturally formed. The water was a transparent blue, with mist swirling above it, adding a hint of mystery to the entire room. Wen Keke felt as if she had stumbled into a fairyland.

Tai Shu Ji Yu walked barefoot to the edge of the pool and prepared to help Wen Keke undress.

Wen Keke chuckled nervously, “I can do it myself!”

Then, under Ji Yu’s watchful gaze, she quickly stripped down to enter the water.

“Wow~”

The water... was freezing...

Wen Keke couldn’t help but shiver. As she splashed into the water, the blue light within seemed to come alive, visibly swirling around her. The pale blue light slowly began to envelop her.

Tai Shu Ji Yu stood at the edge of the pool, watching over Wen Keke in case of any mishaps.

After a while, the light gradually faded away, revealing Wen Keke within.

At that moment, while her appearance hadn’t changed, her aura was entirely different. The cute, cheerful girl next door now held an air of mystery; while her features remained the same, there were occasional flickers of blue light in her eyes, giving her a sharper look.

Symbols similar to those on Ji Yu’s forehead began to appear on Wen Keke’s own.

Wen Keke concentrated intensely, noticing her mind buzzing with newfound energy, filled with a desire to experiment.

“Don’t be afraid; that’s normal. Try to focus your energy and move that over here?” Tai Shu Ji Yu encouraged, pointing to a towel by the pool.

Wen Keke concentrated all her energy on the towel.

One second, two seconds... on the third second, the towel moved!

It wobbled towards her, and Wen Keke reached out to grab it, her face glowing with excitement, “I did it!”

She had finally succeeded! Superpowers!!!

“Did I finally gain superpowers???”

Wen Keke’s heart soared with laughter.

“Little kitty? Little kitty!” Tai Shu Ji Yu looked puzzled at Wen Keke, who was smiling foolishly in the pool. What was going on with her?

Wen Keke snapped back to reality, coughing a few times, “Cough, cough, just got a bit too excited, hehehe~ I’m coming out now!”

Tai Shu Ji Yu chuckled, “The Tai Shu bloodline power is mental strength. Every family member washed in the Clearing Pool will have their mental energy activated, which is why the Tai Shu family remains royal in the Ailan Star System.”

As she spoke, pride gleamed in Tai Shu Ji Yu’s eyes for her family’s honor.

Wen Keke, however, didn’t focus much on Tai Shu Ji Yu’s words about mental strength but instead thought about... every family member had to come to this pool... then...

Seeing the expression on Wen Keke’s face, Tai Shu Ji Yu seemed to understand her thoughts, bursting into laughter, “Little kitty, didn’t you know? The Clearing Pool has clean water every time; those blue energies will remove all impurities, so there’s no water cleaner than this~”

Wen Keke laughed as realization dawned on her, “Got it, got it~”

As the two emerged, Wen Keke spotted Ji He waiting outside and wondered why all the surrounding guards seemed to be trembling.

Waving her head, she dismissed the thought and rushed over to stand in front of Ji He, tilting her head, “Ta-da! Did you notice anything different about me?”

Ji He chuckled at Wen Keke’s quirky antics, resting his chin in thought, “Hmm... let me think...”

Wen Keke narrowed her eyes at Ji He.

He broke into a smile, ruffling Wen Keke’s hair, “You look prettier!”

Wen Keke didn’t hear that part; she was mesmerized by Ji He’s smile.

The sunlight illuminated Ji He’s face, showing every detail of his stubble, his flawless skin, and the light in his eyes which sparkled when he laughed, the long hair casting a halo glimmering in the sunlight, making him appear as if he were a celestial being descended to earth, daunting to behold.

Wen Keke understood why she had called Ji He “Little Star” in the past.

Because Ji He really did have stars in his eyes!
