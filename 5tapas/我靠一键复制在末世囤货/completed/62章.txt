Rainy Day, Who Are You Waiting For (3)

"Ah? I think reading more social news might actually bring up political questions," Wen Qian replied earnestly to Tang Lu's inquiry.

Tang Lu nodded, no longer asking questions. After all, the exam questions in Haiyan City are different from those in other provinces since they are self-compiled. Big news like this might indeed be relevant for the political section.

Wen Keke had already gotten out of bed to eat the food Tang Lu had brought. Hearing Wen Qian's words, she concealed the emotions in her eyes.

Wen Qian...

In the middle of the night, while everyone else was fast asleep, Wen Keke opened her eyes, quietly got off the bed, and ran to the school wall to climb over it.

"Driver, to the LD convenience store."

Wen Keke waved down a taxi, consciously wearing her casual clothes instead of her school uniform for convenience.

"Little girl, that place had a murder not long ago. Are you really going there?" The taxi driver asked, surprised at the sight of such a young girl.

Wen Keke smiled slightly and said, "Thank you, uncle, but my home is that way."

The driver fell silent; after all, if she lived there, he couldn’t exactly tell her to move.

Wen Keke asked the driver to stop at a nearby intersection before getting out.

Standing in front of the convenience store, the large letters "LD" shined brightly at the entrance, and inside, a man dressed in black casual wear was sitting at the cash register.

Hmm?

This store is surprisingly still open?

But the more she looked at the man sitting at the register, the more familiar he seemed. The man raised his head as if sensing Wen Keke's gaze, revealing his handsome features in the light, with pale skin and a cool demeanor.

Upon seeing Wen Keke smile, he stepped forward with long strides.

"You came."

Wen Keke recognized him and, standing there with a beaming smile, said, "Yes! I didn’t expect to find you at a convenience store. If I'd known, I would have come out earlier."

Ji He took Wen Keke's hand and pulled her inside the convenience store, handing her a cup of hot milk as he sat down beside her, speaking gently, "I knew you would come, so I waited for you here."

Wen Keke took a sip of the hot milk; the night in Haiyan City was still somewhat chilly, and this sip warmed her all over—extremely comforting.

Wen Keke sighed.

"Do you have any clues here?" she suddenly remembered the purpose of her visit.

Ji He gently brushed her hair and nodded, "My identity is a sophomore at Su Ning High School, part-time at the LD convenience store. The first victim was a woman living alone, and she happened to be murdered right after her shift that night."

Wen Keke pondered, "Was she murdered in the store?"

She wanted to check the scene; usually, some traces are left behind.

"It was in the store, but that room has already been sealed off."

Wen Keke was deep in thought about the sealed-off room...

"However, I managed to get the key," Ji He added, twirling a key on his finger.

Wen Keke looked at Ji He in surprise, "Wow, our Ji He is simply amazing!"

Men need compliments!

Ji He tilted his head proudly, then closed the convenience store door before leading Wen Keke around to the back storage area. 

In front of them stood a large iron door secured with a heavy lock. Ji He used the key to unlock it and pushed the door open.

The door creaked, and Ji He walked in first, turning on the lights.

"This is it."

Wen Keke stepped inside. This was a small room—after all, it was a convenience store, and the storage area wasn’t big either, probably about a hundred square meters.

The room was empty; the owner must have moved the goods. The floor bore marks from boxes that had been placed there for a long time and various disordered footprints.

Wen Keke looked to the right side, where the caution tape still remained; there were blood stains resembling a human shape on the floor, neatly arranged, and splatters on the wall.

Wen Keke crouched down to examine the traces on the floor; the blood had turned brown from sitting for several days.

"Do you have the first scene report?" Wen Keke asked Ji He, who nodded and took out a document bag.

"I got it from the police station."

Wen Keke paused for a moment and looked at Ji He. He smiled, "It was obtained legally; this body’s uncle is responsible for the case."

Wen Keke felt relieved; she was still a law-abiding citizen at heart and preferred to avoid any illegal activities.

Receiving the document bag, she found a stack of photos and a few A4 papers. Looking at the photos, her brows furrowed involuntarily; this was truly... disturbing.

In the photos, the woman had fair skin, delicate features, and her body was displayed in a T-pose on the ground, with five neat cuts on her neck, two arms, and two thighs.

The cuts were deliberately arranged about ten centimeters apart from the body, with the blood flowing down from where it was placed.

The head was cleanly organized as if intentionally wiped clean.

Wen Keke flipped through a few more photos and noticed something strange; she pointed it out to Ji He: "The cut edges are very neat—this couldn't be done by human hands. I suspect this was done by something other than a human. The blood on the ground is brown, indicating that it was likely dead for some time before being placed here. I believe this is not the first crime scene!"

Moreover, the expression on the corpse was peculiar—one of disbelief. If she had been murdered by a criminal, her expression shouldn't be like this.

Wen Keke then took a look at the back pages of the A4 paper.

Deceased: Su Yun  
Age: 25  
Family: Father, mother, younger brother  
Social Relations: Introverted, not talkative, and had few friends.  
Hobbies: Pastry.

The hobby was circled in red, indicating that there was something wrong with this interest.

Wen Keke flipped to the next page and was surprised to find information about Lin Yin.

Wen Keke raised an eyebrow and read on:  
Name: Lin Yin  
Age: 26  
Family: Father, mother, wife  
Profession: Psychologist  
This section was also circled in red.  
Social Relations: School and psychological clinic.

Hmm? Pastry?

Wen Keke carefully flipped through the subsequent pages and discovered that the pastry teacher reported by Su Yun was actually Lin Yin.
