**Chapter: The Time of Floods Approaches**

Wendy Keke sat in a daze for a moment before she suddenly raised her head to look at the bowl of white porridge on the table. She got up and walked to the edge of the table, scooping a spoonful of porridge and placing it in her mouth.

**"Mmm?"**

Wendy's expression began to shift in confusion... This porridge... She glanced at the spoon in her hand and wondered, why is it so salty? 

Surely, Adam wouldn't make such a rookie mistake? Typically, Adam made breakfast, and on the rare occasions she got up early, she'd be the one cooking, which made her bewilderment even more pronounced.

Could it be that Jessy made it? 

Adam wouldn't make it that... strange. As long as Jessy didn’t accidentally blow up the kitchen, and since Jiao Jiao returned to the military base last night, that only left one possible suspect.

Wendy was shocked by her own thought—surely not! Surely not! 

After a moment of astonishment, she didn’t know why, but she picked up the spoon again and finished the salty porridge.

Meanwhile, Jessy, who had returned to her room, was radiating a sense of joy. Today, she had purposely added a lot of sugar to the porridge; surely, Anan (Wendy) would love it, right? Yesterday, Anan even danced with her!

Jessy’s eyes sparkled with excitement—surely, Anan would start to remember her soon.

Suddenly, a man climbed in through the window, kneeling on one knee.

“Master, the Council has recalled the three elders back to Central Star.”

Jessy’s jubilant mood completely evaporated upon hearing “the Council.”

“Let’s give them a surprise then~”

Jessy’s eyes filled with fury. The people in the Council truly underestimated her patience. In that case… she would send them a gift they wouldn’t forget!

The kneeling man shuddered slightly and replied, “Understood!”

He couldn’t help but feel sympathy for those in the Council. They clearly knew Master’s temperament, yet they dared to provoke her—how foolish.

Despite his many thoughts, the man was swift in his actions. He hid in the shadows, pulled out his holographic device, and sent a message to the Hidden Division in Central Star:

**[Proceed with the original plan.]**

**[Affirmative.]**

The response came immediately, as if they had been waiting right in front of the holographic device.

The man sighed as he put away the device. “Another good show is about to begin…”

Time flew by quickly.

In Huaguo, it took them only about eight days to complete the foundation of the base, with significant help from Wendy’s high-tech assistance. Huaguo even named the base “Dawn Base,” symbolizing that the end times would eventually see the light of dawn. However, Wendy still preferred to call it the Huaguo Base.

Since Wendy’s house was on the front mountain and Huaguo was on the back mountain, to avoid disturbing Wendy, Huaguo specially built a road that directly bypassed to the back mountain from the front, much shorter than the previous route.

Many of the students from Wendy's community chose to move to the Dawn Base for various reasons.

Wendy felt indifferent about it; she was even a bit eager for them to move away. After all, her space in the galaxy had already filled with several tents, and she couldn’t wait to construct her dream garden. She was getting a little bored.

“Goodbye, Miss Wendy!” 

A female classmate bowed with a blush, addressing Wendy shyly.

She felt embarrassed for her actions, knowing she could afford to live there because of Miss Wendy. But as soon as the national base was completed, she moved immediately…

She felt a bit ashamed to face Wendy again.

Wendy cheerfully and gently replied, 

“Goodbye, Xiaohua, be careful on your way!”

**Finally, this is the last one!!!** 

Once she left, she could finally start working on her dream garden!

“G-Goodbye!” the student, who Wendy affectionately called Xiaohua, hurriedly turned and ran away.

Now, Wendy’s community felt completely deserted. She had already closed the supermarket today because it was the official registration day for personnel at the Dawn Base, and everyone had moved there either yesterday or today.

Wendy looked up at the sign she had painted in red, saying “Warm Community,” and smiled faintly. Things were getting better, weren’t they?

She stored the community name in her space and collected all the houses except for the supermarket into her space. Now, the once bustling Warm Community was left with only the fence, the supermarket, and Wendy’s villa. 

“To Starlight, activate the shield protection mode!” 

“Yes, Master!” 

A transparent light curtain rose from the ground around the perimeter, gradually ascending until it fused together into a semicircular membrane in the air. 

The membrane transitioned from white to transparent before vanishing completely from view.

“Master, the protection mode has been perfectly activated!”

Starlight exclaimed joyfully in a mechanical voice. 

Wendy smiled brightly at the half-formed barrier, marveling at how her safety had increased.

The so-called shield protection mode was a program designed by Starlight specifically for Wendy. With Huaguo Base established, Wendy felt that her security system here was inadequate.

Just like that incident with the woman, while Wendy could handle it easily, such occurrences could still dampen her spirits. 

Thus, Starlight devised this program, capable of detecting the malevolence of every individual. It was divided into three levels: 

1. Upon detecting level one malevolence, Starlight wouldn’t notify Wendy but would throw the malicious person out of the supermarket directly.
2. If level two malevolence were detected, Starlight would inform Wendy, implement some punishment measures, and then blacklist the person.
3. In the case of level three malevolence, Starlight would immediately activate the alert mode. As soon as the person entered the shielded area, they would be launched skyward.

Of course, there were classification standards for these three levels of malevolence.

Level one involved ordinary petty thoughts of malice that wouldn’t affect Wendy. For instance, if a person intended to steal from her supermarket, this would be classified as level one malevolence.

Level two malevolence indicated that a person’s thoughts would impact their actions in relation to Wendy. For instance, if someone intended to fight another person and accidentally struck Wendy instead—though it was inconceivable that anyone would actually harm Wendy.

Level three malevolence referred directly to thoughts and actions aimed at harming Wendy. For example, if someone had the intent to kill Wendy and was ready to act on it.

Upon hearing Starlight’s explanation of the classifications, Wendy couldn’t help but give a thumbs up. She hadn’t thought about it so thoroughly herself.

With the shield mode activated, Wendy decided to include it as part of her dream garden’s protection system. She had already prepared all the elements needed for her dream garden and planned to begin construction after the floods arrived.

Currently, Huaguo dispatched personnel daily to inspect the flood prevention dikes that Hu Qingyun had constructed earlier. 

She heard that a new tool developed by a certain Dr. Gao could predict signs of impending floods.

“Flood’s coming! Flood's coming! Hurry back to the base! Don’t just stand there, get in the car!”

A man in a lab coat drove quickly toward the back mountain. Spotting Wendy standing by the roadside, he hurriedly stopped the car and shouted at her.

Wendy frowned. Why had it arrived so quickly? Weren’t there still about six days left?

Thinking about the premature end of the extreme cold and now the early onset of the flood, Wendy pondered for a moment before deciding to get in the car to visit the Huaguo Base. She wondered what preparations they had made.
