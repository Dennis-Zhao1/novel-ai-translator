温可可 stood on the deck, staring at the raging floodwaters before her, completely unaware of what Xu Jin was writing. The towering buildings that normally surrounded her were now submerged, leaving nothing but a vast expanse of water in front of her. 

Various shattered pieces of furniture floated on the surface, along with scattered branches, clothing, and remnants of food—items that were once common in everyday life, now disheveled and adrift in the floodwaters, casting a stark, forlorn scene. A sense of inexplicable heaviness settled in her heart as she sighed deeply.

"Ah... let's head back, Ah He," she called out to her companion.

Ji He followed her back into the cabin, where the soldiers from the Dawn Base were training in the gym. Even aboard the ship, they did not take a moment to relax. 

Inspired by their enthusiasm, 温可可 decided to join them in the training room.

"Wenwen!" Lin Jiaojiao's voice called out from outside the training room. Wiping the sweat off her face with a towel, 温可可 paused her workout, opened the door, and asked, "What’s up, Jiaojiao?"

Lin Jiaojiao, dressed sharply in military uniform, smiled at her. "They're having a party on the third floor and insist that you, the great philanthropist Miss Wen, should attend. So, as a major, I’m here to invite you. Will you go?"

温可可 smirked playfully at Lin Jiaojiao, "Oh? Why wouldn’t I go?"

The two exchanged smiles as Lin Jiaojiao patted 温可可 on the shoulder.

In the entertainment hall on the third floor, all the furniture had been pushed against the walls, leaving a large, open space in the center where everyone sat on the floor. On the tables along the walls were an assortment of grilled skewers and a pile of beer.

As they feasted on the barbecued meats and drank beer, satisfied smiles lit up everyone’s faces. Since the apocalypse began, although the Huaguo had made preparations a month in advance, they had still been living frugally. It was only during the New Year's Eve dinner that they had the chance to enjoy such indulgent feasting.

When 温可可 and Lin Jiaojiao arrived, Taishu Ji Yu and Ji He were already there, though due to their unique presence, not many people approached them. Ji He moved to sit next to 温可可, holding her hand without hesitation, aware that there were plenty of men in the hall interested in her.

"Miss Wen is here!" 

"Quick, let Miss Wen through!" 

"Make room for her, hurry!" 

The soldiers sitting in front noticed 温可可 and Lin Jiaojiao and shouted to the crowd, who quickly parted to let them through. 

Curious gazes fixated on 温可可, who was an enigma to them as she was the sole provider of resources for the entire Dawn Base. They were intrigued by tales of the warm community she had created, the technological marvels, and the very ship they stood on, the "Meteor".

What kind of person could be so amazing? She had everything imaginable!

温可可 held her head high, walking forward as confidently as she could, while Ji He did not follow but squeezed her hand before she stepped away. With a playful smile, she kissed his cheek, leaving Ji He momentarily stunned.

Approaching the group gathered around General Wei and various military leaders, she greeted them. 

"Miss Wen has arrived," General Wei stated, looking friendlier than usual, a串 of grilled lamb skewers in his hand. He smiled at her, saying, "Did you really think I wouldn’t want you here?” 

温可可, taking a few skewers and a can of beer, sat down, popped open her drink, and cheekily replied, "Would you dare to say that, General?"

"How could I? Mr. Wang wouldn’t let me live it down!" General Wei laughed heartily, raising his beer for a toast.

As they clinked cans, General Wei continued, "Miss Wen, this time it shouldn’t just be about delivering supplies to City D, right?" 

温可可 took a bite of the grilled meat, maintaining a calm demeanor as she asked, "Why would you think that, General?"

He twirled the skewer, his gaze distant. "You’ve closed off the community and opened up the Dream Garden probably for the magma stones, right? You mentioned before that they are an energy source, but with our current technology, we can't use them. You’re not from Blue Star, yet since you opened the Dream Garden, it seems you have no plans to leave. What’s your urgency in collecting magma stones for?"

温可可 turned to face him. "And what would you like me to gather those magma stones for, General?"

General Wei focused intently on her, his eyes sharp. "I don’t know what you’re after, nor do I have the capacity to know. But... I don’t want what you do in the future to influence the current Dawn Base. I wouldn’t want us to find ourselves on opposing sides. Would you grant this old soldier a small wish?" 

He ended that thought with a smile. 

温可可 sighed softly, her own frustration easing at the sight of General Wei’s expressed concerns. She considered his lifetime service to the military, understanding that his loyalties lay firmly with the state. It was natural for him to worry about her intentions as someone with powerful capabilities.

"Of course; after all, I’m a good law-abiding citizen!" she declared with emphasis.

General Wei’s worries dissipated upon hearing her words, and his demeanor relaxed significantly. He chuckled heartily, praising, "Haha, law-abiding is great! Miss Wen, that’s you!"

Feeling relieved, General Wei thought he might have been overthinking things. He didn’t want to pry too deeply, after all. If it came to it, what did he have to lose? The worst case was just his life, which he’d gladly trade for peace of mind. 

It turned out that Miss Wen was indeed the great philanthropist Mr. Wang described!

"General Wei, I’m not just that—I’m… this!" 温可可 playfully raised her two thumbs up. 

He gazed at her youthful exuberance, feeling his eyes moistening slightly as he reminisced about his own children.

Shaking off those thoughts, he laughed heartily, "Of course! Miss Wen is worth so much more! Come, let’s toast again!"

温可可 lifted her beer can once more, clinking it against his with a cheer. "Cheers!"
