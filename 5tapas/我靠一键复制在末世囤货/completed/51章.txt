Beibei's Cottage

In Dreamland, VIPs enjoy many privileges.

First, VIP players can have lifetime access to Dreamland. This includes rights to all facilities such as restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues.

Second, VIP players can gain access to the interstellar villas, which are separate from Dreamland and not open to the public. These villas are privately assigned, and only top-tier elites have the chance to stay there.

Third, VIP players receive a Little Ai robot. The functions of Little Ai are beyond compare; it can perform tasks, carry things, and manage chores. There's nothing that Little Ai cannot do. However, if used for malicious intents, it will be shut down by the Stardust System, which has full monitoring authority.

The rest of the people gazed at the man with envy, knowing they had missed their chance to enter first and were preparing to move towards the buildings they admired previously.

“Hi there~ Hello! I'm the tour guide of Dreamland—Abel. Feel free to ask me anything~”

Each person had a small, palm-sized robot flying beside them. The robot was silver, round, and had transparent wings flapping gently. A little antenna extended from its forehead, and it spoke in a cute mechanical voice.

A girl, her eyes sparkling at the sight of the adorable robot guide, asked, “Abel, could you tell me about the fun things in Dreamland?”

Abel's antenna emitted a blue light that projected a map of Dreamland in the air, and it explained in its mechanical voice, “Of course! It's my honor to serve you, madam! 

Beneath your feet is the Flower Meadow of Dreamland, made up of countless types of flowers. Among them is a transparent flower, serving as Dreamland's mode of transportation, named Duoduo. If you want to go anywhere, just stand on it, and it will take you there~ 

A hundred meters ahead is the Rabbit House, which belongs to Mr. Wright. If you have any needs, you can tell Mr. Wright; he loves new and interesting ideas! 

On the first floor of the Rabbit House, there’s an indoor roller coaster. You can choose from various modes, including Cosmic, Fairyland, Underwater, and Fairy Tale themes, among many others! 

The second floor is the Entertainment World, featuring games like human bubble balls, red and blue bumper cars, and wooden horses for children to enjoy~ 

The third floor is the rooftop of the Rabbit House, home to Mr. Wright's favorite game—Death Climb. I assume a beautiful lady like you wouldn't be interested in that! 

After passing the Rabbit House, you'll encounter the little fairy, Sika. She's a lovely girl who adores beautiful people like you! I'm sure she would be thrilled to see you, madam~ 

In Sika's domain, you can purchase many lovely clothes and accessories, and even participate in various activities like fashion making, gemstone selection, and hairstyle competitions! 

Oh, by the way, Sika hosts fashion shows every week! Winning first place earns you a reward! 

To the right of Sika is our warrior, Mr. Somonlo, the combat champion of Dreamland~ 

In Mr. Somonlo's territory, you can enter virtual battlefields to sharpen your combat skills! You can choose from ancient battlefields, interstellar battlegrounds, apocalypse war zones, and insectoid battlegrounds, among others~ 

Mr. Somonlo has three levels: Warrior Level, General Level, and King Level. When you start, you'll be at Warrior Level. If you win ten matches in a row, you'll advance to General Level; win fifty more matches, and you will become a King! 

Reaching King Level grants you Mr. Somonlo's friendship! A little secret—I must tell you, Mr. Somonlo's friendship is not easily earned~ 

Oh! Do you see that tree in the air? 

That is Mr. Gu, our respected sage! He is highly knowledgeable and loves smart people. You can experience the most interesting escape rooms with him~ 

Those fortunate enough to gain Mr. Gu's favor will receive one of his notebooks, which is truly invaluable! 

Oh! Do you see that large empty space to the right? That's our Dreamland's specialty—the Dream Coaster~ It will let you experience a dreamy sensation~ 

As you move forward, you will see Beibei's Cottage! Though it's small, it can accommodate tens of thousands! 

Beibei is known for his delicious cooking! However, he has a peculiar temperament; he dislikes when others place orders. But you can trust Beibei’s choices! 

You simply need to sit down, and Beibei will automatically prepare a feast for you—a truly delightful experience~”

The girl's eyes shone brighter and brighter. Before the apocalypse, she was a foodie, and during the catastrophe, she almost starved. Now, she is even more particular about food. Recently, with the floods, she didn't care; she had been following the team digging for magma stones, saving up plenty just to buy food!

Originally, she didn't want to come to Dreamland, but with Miss Wen's supermarket gone, she wanted to check if there were any supermarkets left in Dreamland. To her surprise, there are restaurants?

Now, upon hearing about Beibei's Cottage as a restaurant, she was eager to cut the conversation short and rush to the cottage for food!

“Abel, can I go to the restaurant right now?” she asked eagerly.

Abel happily flew around her in excitement: “Of course, beautiful lady~ Please step onto Duoduo now~”

Following instructions, she chose a flower that was just big enough for a person to stand on.

The transparent flower's five petals rose, enveloping her in a soft white haze, then extended white wings on either side, slowly lifting her towards Beibei's Cottage.

From the outside, Beibei's Cottage looked like a giant piece of braised pork, each layer of meat corresponding to a different floor.

The first floor is divided into eight major cuisines: Cantonese, Sichuan, Shandong, Huaiyang, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, and Anhui.

Of course, one cannot order; it's all up to Beibei's whim, but you definitely won't regret it~

The second floor is for hotpot and grilled meat.

As you stand at the entrance, a corresponding robot will guide you to your seat, which is again determined by Beibei's choice!

The third floor offers Japanese cuisine, the fourth Korean cuisine, and the fifth is a paradise for hamburgers, fried chicken, French fries, and other fried foods~

Cuiya could hardly wait as she gazed at the introduction at the entrance; she wanted hotpot! Hotpot! Hotpot!

She dashed up to the second floor, headed to the hotpot area, and was greeted by a round-headed robot dressed in red, looking quite festive. It guided Cuiya to a table in front of a large table, where there was a full set of bowls, chopsticks, and a large cup. 

Along the wall was a beverage station, featuring various drink buttons, where pressing one would deliver the corresponding drink.
