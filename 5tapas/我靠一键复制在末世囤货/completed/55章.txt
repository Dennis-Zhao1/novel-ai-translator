New Year's Eve

As Wen Keke eagerly awaited the completion of Starfall’s work, over in Huaguo, Lin Jiaojiao arrived. 

“Wen Wen, there’s just one week until the New Year! The commanders want to invite you to join them,” Lin Jiaojiao said, half-draped over Wen Keke. 

Wen Keke paused, surprised. New Year's was approaching? She quickly took out her phone and checked. Oh right, it was already the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month, just one week before the New Year's Eve. 

Time felt so surreal in this post-apocalyptic world. 

Wen Keke shook her head. “No, I want to spend it at home.” 

Lin Jiaojiao lovingly patted Wen Keke’s head, her playful demeanor shining through. “I knew it! That’s why I declined the invitation for you right away.” 

Wen Keke hugged Lin Jiaojiao tightly, burying her face in her embrace. “You know you’re the best, Jiaojiao!” 

“This time, I asked for leave from the base. I’ll spend New Year’s with you,” Lin Jiaojiao replied, returning the hug. They only had each other now. 

“Great! I’m craving your Coca-Cola chicken wings!” Wen Keke whined, her eyes misty in Lin Jiaojiao's embrace. She missed her mom and dad. 

During past New Year celebrations, her parents would rush home from far away to join her for the reunion dinner, bringing her a lot of gifts. 

Now, she was all alone. Well, not entirely—there was Jiaojiao, Jinbao, Ji He... 

For some reason, Wen Keke recalled the comforting way Ji He had once patted her head during the flood, their moonlit dance, and the serious way he had given her a ring at the dinner table, and how he brought her a bowl of porridge in the early morning. 

Flushing, Wen Keke rubbed her suddenly warm face. Why was she feeling shy? 

With the New Year approaching, Dreamland transformed overnight into a sea of red. 

The flowers in Baihua Ping turned into red roses, dragon boat flowers, kapok flowers, geraniums, and poinsettias, among others. 

Even Light, who usually appeared as a gentlemanly rabbit in a suit, turned into a rabbit wearing a red hanfu, complete with a red ribbon tied to its ears to fit the festive mood. 

At Beibei’s place, dishes were particularly favored in red, like braised pork hocks, sweet and sour ribs, spicy chicken bites, and so on. 

Somonro remained unchanged, but players had recently discovered various side quests in Somonro’s game, like finding Chinese knots, writing couplets, and maybe even receiving red packets from Somonro himself if they were lucky. 

Mr. Gu also tied numerous riddles to his tree; solving a riddle could earn players a gift from him. 

The most adorable, of course, was Xika, dressed in clothing that resembled a traditional New Year painting doll. The rabbit fur collar made her small face even more delicate, and her hair was styled in two cute buns, adorned with red ribbons that hung down with blessings, looking just like a fortune doll. 

Recently, more people had been visiting Xika’s fairyland, especially many elderly folks who adored her festive appearance. 

Sometimes, Albedo would throw little surprises, with flying jellyfish shooting out colorful streamers that contained mysterious rewards, much to everyone’s delight. 

Behind the joy, there was always some hidden sadness. Wen Keke had specially created a new realm called 【Reunion】. 

From the outside, 【Reunion】 appeared as a silver glowing sphere, but it was a project Wen Keke designed specifically for the New Year. 

In 【Reunion】, everyone could reunite with the person they most wished to see—relatives, friends, lovers, or pets. 

Here, they could enjoy a joyful reunion dinner with those dear to their hearts. The realm mimicked the behavior and speech of those from their memory, allowing them to fulfill their wishes. 

Of course, some might get lost in the reunion, but Starfall had designed an emotional detector. If the emotional attachment reached a certain threshold, Starfall would automatically shut down the realm, bringing them back to reality. 

It was like a beautiful dream woven by Wen Keke for those who needed it. 

Soon, New Year’s Eve arrived. 

Wen Keke woke up early that day. After feeding Jinbao, she gave him a bath with disposable gloves and dressed him in a cute red Qilin costume. As he waddled around, he looked so adorable that anyone would want to kiss him. 

The villa had previously been decorated beautifully by Wen Keke, Xu Jin, and Lin Jiaojiao. 

Every window displayed the character for “blessing,” hand-written by Ji He, which surprised Wen Keke with how well an alien could write traditional calligraphy. 

Tai Shuchi Yu showcased her paper-cutting skills after Ji He had stolen Wen Keke's attention, and it was absolutely spectacular! 

Wen Keke wanted to applaud; Sister Ji's paper-cuts were incredibly vivid. It was astonishing that an authoritative-looking sister Ji would be so skilled in this art. 

Xu Jin took care of all the cleaning and, honestly, someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder always keeps things clean! Even with robots, having a human clean for the New Year created a much better atmosphere. 

Wen Keke also donned a stunning red outfit that day, chosen carefully by Lin Jiaojiao and Tai Shuchi Yu together. 

It consisted of a red woolen coat resembling a cape, surrounded by a white fur trim, the collar lined with fluffy white fabric, paired with a matching short skirt. 

Her long hair was styled into two low ponytails with red bows at the ends, and because of her good figure, she looked like she had stepped out of an anime. 

Cradling the matching Jinbao only added to her charm wherever she went. 

“Wen Wen!” 

Lin Jiaojiao rushed back in from outside that day. Since the base was closed, she wasn’t in her military uniform but wore a stylish red outfit that Wen Keke had chosen for her—it paired a white inner with loose white pants and tall boots. On top, she wore a bright red coat, and her light blue ear studs sparkled, making her short hair appear both cool and soft. 

Lin Jiaojiao's face beamed with a smile; she had just come back from 【Reunion】. 

Wen Keke knew where Lin Jiaojiao had just been, so she hugged her silently without saying anything. 

“I just missed him a bit, but seeing him again was enough for me,” Lin Jiaojiao said with a smile. She had come to terms with her feelings; one couldn’t dwell in the past forever. Her dad wouldn’t want her to feel despondent like that—she would look forward and carry a piece of him forward with her, striving to serve her country! 

Wen Keke exaggerated playfully, “Jiaojiao, you’re finally acting a bit like Jiaojiao!” 

Lin Jiaojiao's expression fell as she put her hands on her hips, gritting her teeth. “Wen! Ke! You want to relive old memories, huh?” 

Wen Keke quickly covered her mouth, making a zipping motion with her hand. “I won’t say a word!” 

Lin Jiaojiao huffed, crossing her arms. 

“Boss!” Xu Jin said as he walked in carrying a black box. 

Wen Keke looked at him curiously. “What’s that black box for?” 

Xu Jin placed the box on the table and turned to Wen Keke. “Boss, this was sent over from Dawn Base by Mr. Wang. He said it’s something left by your father.”
