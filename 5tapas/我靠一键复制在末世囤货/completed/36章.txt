**Wen Jinshu**

**The Military Base of the Huaguo Foundation in City S.**

General David Wei stood solemnly at the gates of the base early, flanked by a formation of troops who stood resolute, maintaining a perfect military posture. 

“Beep—Beep—Beep!”

Green military vehicles rolled into the base, kicking up snow as they passed. When General Wei sighted the convoy, he quickly gestured for the gate to be opened.

One by one, countless vehicles poured in, filling the training grounds to capacity.

Clara Lin stepped out of a vehicle, striding purposefully toward General Wei, followed closely by Sun Zhi. The remaining vehicles unloaded survivors, who were then escorted by base personnel to their quarters.

Spotting Clara, General Wei swiftly inquired, “What about him? Is he not here yet?” 

Wasn’t he supposed to arrive today? Where could he be...

Clara saluted sharply and reported, “Sir! The chief’s vehicle is just behind ours, they should be here shortly.” 

General Wei nodded understandingly but couldn’t shake his anxiousness; nothing must happen to that individual.

Just then, another chain of vehicles announced their arrival, clearly protecting the one in the center. That vehicle drove straight up to General Wei.

His expression lightened with excitement as he adjusted his collar.

The door opened, and a young man dressed in military garb and holding a rifle jumped out and respectfully opened the rear door. He stood guard outside diligently.

Then, a pair of legs clad in tailored trousers exited the vehicle. Looking up, a middle-aged man in his fifties, dressed formally in a black coat with a slightly graying head of hair and a gentle smile, emerged.

Following closely was Chief Wang.

General Wei stepped forward excitedly and saluted, “Sir! General David Wei of the Huaguo Foundation in City S reporting! Thank you for your efforts!”

The Chief extended his hand with a friendly smile, stating, “You’re the one who’s been working hard! Let’s head inside; everyone looks rather tired standing around.”

General Wei nodded eagerly, “Yes, we should get in.”

Chief Wang’s attention turned to Clara Lin. “You’re the daughter of the Lin family, right? Truly admirable! Come along.”

Clara felt a rush of surprise; being called over was significant. It meant she was included in something important. A wave of excitement she rarely showed swept across her face. “Yes, sir!”

**Inside the Base Conference Room.**

“Let’s discuss the current situation in City S,” Chief Wang asked General Wei, taking the main seat.

General Wei responded, “As of now, the number of survivors in City S is… under a million. We’ve lost nearly thirty percent of the base personnel…”

His gaze fell, guilt weighing on him; if only they had noticed the unusual weather earlier, they could have saved so many lives…

Chief Wang sighed, “You’ve done well given the circumstances.”

Chief Wang, observing the somber exchange, furrowed his brow. “Why the sigh? There’s no time for that! Don’t you see people are living outside?”

Chief Wang laughed lightly, seeing his impatient brother. “You’re right, we shouldn’t dwell on gloom. The site has been chosen, hasn’t it? And we need to contact other cities’ troops to assess how many survivors are left. Also, have the scientists from the research institute been brought over?”

General Wei nodded solemnly. “Dr. Gao and his students are already here. They brought many supplies from the institute and are currently repairing the communications tower. As for the site location... Dr. Gao previously suggested Qi Ju Mountain…”

Chief Wang looked at General Wei with scrutiny. “What’s the catch? Is there something wrong with Qi Ju Mountain?” 

General Wei briefly glanced at Clara Lin, hesitating, then said, “That mountain has the daughter of a certain individual living there… Wen Keke.”

Clara’s expression froze at the mention of Wen Keke’s name, but she quickly masked her initial surprise, though her tightly clenched hands revealed her unease.

Chief Wang squinted, “Wen? That means it’s Wen Jinshu.” 

As thoughts of Wen Jinshu surfaced, Chief Wang’s expression became grave. “We can’t simply dismiss this, can we?”

He recalled the words left behind by Wen Jinshu before their departure. The reason the Wang family was able to compete against outsiders from the Zhao family all these years was largely due to the gifts left behind.

General Wei looked slightly taken aback. “Well… you see…”

Chief Wang, unable to bear the ambiguity any longer, slammed his hand onto the table with a resounding clap. “Just speak plainly! What’s with all the hesitation?”

General Wei reluctantly raised his hands in resignation, “It’s not that I’m trying to avoid it, it’s just… cough cough... Wen Jinshu’s daughter has developed a housing complex and supermarket in Qi Ju Mountain, so we can’t establish a base there.”

Chief Wang shouted incredulously, “She’s managing supplies to run a supermarket? There’s no way anyone would go there in the apocalypse!”

General Wei nodded silently, “Yes, people are going.”

Chief Wang pondered for a moment before stating, “I’ll go speak with her directly. Whatever conditions she wants, I can meet them. I might sacrifice my own face, but we can’t let so many lives go to waste!”

General Wei attempted to interject, “Sir, we certainly don’t have to build at Qi Ju Mountain; we can find another location!” 

Chief Wang chuckled then turned to General Wei, asking, “Do you know who Dr. Gao’s teacher was?”

General Wei shook his head in confusion.

Chief Wang replied steadily, “Wen Jinshu.”

Suddenly, General Wei grasped the situation. Wen Jinshu, the clandestine leader behind Huaguo’s technological advancements, had propelled the country forward for five centuries. Thanks to his foresight, Huaguo could sustain a population of over a million amidst this apocalyptic disaster, whereas many foreign nations had been completely wiped out.

Meanwhile, Chief Wang remained oblivious to the context, pulling at his hair in frustration. He could not comprehend why an admiral also had to navigate the intricacies of such games people played.

Ugh! It was a disgrace to the military!

Completely unaware of Chief Wang’s disdain, General Wei and Chief Wang exited the conference room and soon spotted Sun Zhi waiting outside.

“Hey, little Sun! Aren’t you in City B? What brings you back?” General Wei asked.

Sun Zhi lowered his head, explaining the situation in City B.

General Wei sighed and stepped forward, embracing Sun Zhi. “Good boy, you’ve done well!” 

Pain flickered in his eyes as he realized the dire state of affairs back in City B.

Clara Lin, emerging from the conference room, made her way directly to the parking area. She flashed her credentials and drove out of the military base, heading straight for Qi Ju Mountain, where Wen Keke was residing.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere atop Qi Ju Mountain was unusually jubilant.

“Yay! I won! Cake! Cake!!!” 

A girl squealed in excitement, clutching a gashapon toy in her hand. 

Indeed, it was a gashapon toy.

Wen Keke thought there were so many students on the mountain now; they should have some entertainment. So, she had Xingyun craft a couple of gashapon machines. For one point, a person could spin three times, and they were guaranteed at least one prize.

The prizes included all sorts of food items noted on slips of paper, including cake, sweet potatoes, chips, cola, braised meat, and more. The grand prize was an extravagant feast that nobody had won yet.

Since the gashapon machine had been introduced, there was no shortage of people eager to play. How could anyone not win at least something? The fun was undeniable!

In a world that felt apocalyptic, after a couple of months of tension, they could finally relax.

There were even requests for Wen Keke to sell televisions, prompting her to develop a new idea: yes! Xingyun could build a network! This way, electronic devices could be utilized!
