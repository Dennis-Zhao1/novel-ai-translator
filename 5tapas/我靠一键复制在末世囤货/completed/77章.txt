### Welcome Back to the Palace, Your Highness

Winnie, upon hearing from Julian, learned that she was actually born in the interstellar realm. Her father had escaped from the Senate and had been living in space ever since. With his perfect genes, he possessed tremendous abilities, and after the Senate lost control, they could do nothing to him.

She had known Julian since childhood, and he had always called her "Little Star."

"But my memories have always been of my life on Blue Planet; I have no memories of living in space?" Winnie was puzzled. According to Julian, she should have still been in the stars at the age of five or six, so why did she have no recollection?

"Perhaps your father did something to you," Julian suggested.

Winnie nodded; that might be the case, but...

"Little Star~"

Julian watched as Winnie feigned surprise. 

Seeing that Julian didn’t respond, she leaned in closer:

"Little Star~"

"Little Star~ Little Star~ Little Star~"

Julian couldn’t hold back any longer; his ears were flushed red as he pulled Winnie into his arms to silence her.

In January 2077, Dawn City was nearly completed, with other cities being built elsewhere. However, Dawn City remained the central hub, fervently developing technology and working to close the gap with the stars. 

The positional shield Julian had set for Blue Planet had also broken down, and Winnie decided to travel with Julian to the central star of the Ailan system. Her father and mother might be waiting for her there.

"Miss Winnie, take care on your journey!" David Wang, the highest authority in Dawn City, spoke as he reluctantly shook Winnie's hand. 

Wasn’t it heartbreaking? Most of Dawn City’s technological advancements over the past year had been derived from data provided by Winnie, and now, she was about to leave.

"Winnie, you will come back, right?" Lily Lin hugged Willie gently. She respected all of Winnie’s choices; if she knew where her father was, she would search for him without hesitation.

"I will definitely come back, especially since you’ll still be here!" Winnie returned the hug. She would come back, and this time, she would bring her parents along; after all, this was her home.

"Boss, you must come back to see us!" Andy Xu's eyes were glistening with tears. What would he do without her and the precious Golden Treasure?

"Don’t worry; I still have to return to check on my Dream Garden, and you’ll be in charge for now," Winnie said seriously while patting Andy’s shoulder.

"Don’t worry, I promise to turn the Dream Garden into Blue Planet’s number one attraction!" Andy vowed.

Winnie then said her goodbyes one by one before holding Julian’s hand and addressing Julian and Lady Ji Yu, "Let’s go, Julian, Lady Yu."

Julian comfortingly patted Winnie’s head, "Alright."

He then activated the space button for position jump.

"I'm coming to the central star."

Upon touching down in the central star’s Star Building, Winnie was taken aback by the scene before her. She turned to Julian with her eyes asking, "Did you do this?"

Julian raised his head, pretending to know nothing. This certainly had to be a creation of the Star Alliance...

It seemed the Star Alliance had been too idle lately...

Winnie's landing point was in the hall of the Star Building. The area was adorned with various flowers and colorful streamers, and in front of her was a red carpet, flanked by guards in red uniforms, each holding a bouquet of bright red flowers.

As Winnie and Julian touched down, confetti rained down from above, creating a scene akin to a traditional Blue Planet wedding.

"Welcome back, Lady and Lord of the House!" shouted the Star Alliance soldiers led by Luminous.

Winnie awkwardly waved, "Um… hello?"

Lady Ji Yu stood off to the side, laughing heartily, "Kitty, would you like to come back to the Ji residence now?"

Winnie looked over, confused.

Lady Ji Yu took Winnie’s hand, "Follow me and everything will become clear."

Winnie turned to Julian, puzzled. What was going on?

Julian gave Winnie an assuring look, "I’ll go with you."

Lady Ji Yu arched an eyebrow, smirking. The royal family must be terrified if Julian showed up...

But it would also be amusing...

Winnie nodded to Lady Ji Yu, "Okay."

Finally, she was about to find out what was going on.

She had sensed something was off with Lady Yu; why had she come from the interstellar realm and stayed with her without any requests, giving her so much instead? 

Was Julian’s treatment due to their prior relationship? What about Lady Ji Yu’s intentions?

Would she finally uncover the truth?

As the trio exited the Star Building, they were met by a long line of hovering vehicles. Surrounding the vehicles were a group of soldiers dressed like knights, each standing tall and exemplifying their best selves.

The hovering vehicle parked before Lady Ji Yu was adorned with golden patterns, exuding an aura of nobility and elegance, matching the designs on Lady Ji Yu's forehead.

Winnie stared in amazement at the crown that suddenly appeared above Lady Ji Yu, glistening with a sparkling gem at its center.

Just then, a white-haired man in a white robe stepped down from the opposing vehicle and knelt on one knee before Lady Ji Yu, saying, "Welcome back, Your Highness."

The rest of the soldiers knelt, reciting in unison, "Welcome back, Your Highness."

The one referred to as "Your Highness," Lady Ji Yu, smirked, her lips curling as she pulled the still-stunned Winnie along, "Let’s go home together, Kitty."

Winnie found herself dazed as she was ushered into the hovering vehicle. From the outside, it appeared to be a singularly sized car, but once inside, she realized the internal space was surprisingly vast.

To the left was a large table piled high with documents, and next to it stood a big bookshelf filled with books that Winnie couldn't comprehend at all.

In the center was a soft sofa and table, presumably the guest area.

To the right, there was a large bed where Lady Ji Yu must rest.

Winnie and Julian sat on the sofa in the middle as Lady Ji Yu retrieved various snacks from her spatial bracelet and placed them on the table.

"Sister Ji, what’s going on?" Winnie inquired, looking at Lady Ji Yu, who seemed unchanged yet currently radiated a regal aura, resembling that of royalty.

Lady Ji Yu removed the ring she had been wearing and said softly, "I’m sorry, Kitty. Let me introduce myself; I am Lady Ji Yu."

Initially taken aback by the ring, which looked familiar, Winnie stood there in shock. Ji Yu? That was the same surname as her mother!

With the realization that her mother was also from space, a thought began to form in Winnie’s mind...
