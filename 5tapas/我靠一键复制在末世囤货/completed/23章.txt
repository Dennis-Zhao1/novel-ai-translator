**Poor Xu Jin**

Keke Wen was preparing to make the spiciest dish in Sichuan cuisine—Spicy Rabbit from Zigong. Feeling quite hungry, she took out a previously purchased, prepped rabbit.  

The soul of this dish lies in the ingredients. For the peppers, she chose a generous amount of two kinds: Erjingtiao and small millet peppers, making sure to have plenty. She also made sure to have a large quantity of ginger.  

She cut the Erjingtiao into small rings, shredded the ginger, and chopped the small millet peppers into bits.  

Next, she placed the cut-up pieces of rabbit into a bowl, adding salt, chicken essence, and cooking wine, mixing it all together. She added a bit of cornstarch to ensure the rabbit would be tender, then drizzled a little oil to lock in moisture and keep the meat juicy.  

In a pan, she poured in half the oil, heating it until it was hot enough. Then, she added the marinated rabbit pieces. Once the moisture on the surface of the rabbit evaporated, she removed them and set them aside.  

Still using the same pan, Keke Wen added a handful of Sichuan peppercorns, minced ginger, and garlic to stir-fry until fragrant. She added some sea pepper, the previously chopped small millet peppers, and shredded ginger, continuing to stir until the ginger's aroma filled the air.  

At this point, she added enough water to bring to a boil before adding the rabbit pieces back in. Since the rabbit had already been briefly fried, it was nearly cooked through, so Keke Wen simply had to season it now.  

She added salt, chicken essence, sugar, monosodium glutamate, and some pepper oil, then tossed in the remaining small millet peppers and shredded ginger, letting it simmer for one to two minutes to extract the fresh ginger flavor. Just before serving, she added the cut Erjingtiao and splashed in Zigong's unique sun-dried vinegar, stirring it all together before removing it from the heat.  

The dish didn't particularly attract Jin Bao, but it caught the attention of Ji He.  

Keke Wen saw Ji He standing by the door and realized he must be hungry. She called out, “Dinner will be ready in five minutes! Just need a cold salad to finish!”  

Hearing this, Ji He didn’t return to his room but instead went to serve himself rice, sitting down at the dining table.  

Of course, when Ji He was dishing out food, he only served himself and Keke Wen. Considering Keke Wen had made all the dishes, he begrudgingly helped with that. As for the others—what did they count as?  

Watching Ji He, Keke Wen felt a smile creeping up. For some reason, this Mr. Ji, with his handsome face focused on her, reminded her of the earlier, less grounded version of Ji He from a different world.  

It made her feel as if a younger Ji He was there, waiting eagerly to be fed.  

Shaking her head, since she had prepared a lot of meat, Keke Wen decided to make a cold salad of shredded vegetables.  

She got a small bunch of spinach, half a carrot, and a suitable amount of vermicelli. The vermicelli were softened in boiling water, while the spinach and carrot were cleaned—one was cut into two segments, the other shredded, then briefly blanched in boiling water.  

Once removed from the pot, they were rinsed under cold water. After squeezing out the excess moisture, she added the softened vermicelli.  

At this time, she whisked two eggs together, poured oil into a frying pan, and added the whisked eggs, gently shaking the pan. Once the egg mixture spread into a thin omelet, she rolled it up and cut it into strips, adding it to the vegetables.  

Then she seasoned it with minced garlic, salt, chicken essence, soy sauce, fragrant vinegar, sesame oil, chili oil, and white sesame, mixing it all vigorously before plating.  

Just as Keke Wen was about to serve the dishes, Xu Jin popped into the kitchen, seemingly knowing she was done. He eagerly said to Keke Wen, “I'll carry the dishes! You've worked hard; go take a seat!”  

He quickly took the dishes to the dining table, also lightly nudging Keke Wen toward her seat.  

Don’t ask him why he was so eager!  

Just earlier, Mr. Ji had knocked on his door out of the blue. When Xu Jin opened the door, there stood Mr. Ji, saying nothing at all.  

Xu Jin, wrapped snugly in a thick blanket and standing at the doorway, felt a bit chilly, even though the room was warmer than outside. After all, among the four people and a cat, only Xu Jin hadn’t been enhanced; the other three, two extraterrestrials, one who fancied herself normal but wasn’t—Keke Wen—and Jin Bao, were all strengthened by the temperature-adjusting potion she handed out.  

Xu Jin had been scared, thinking perhaps he had upset Ji He recently.  

Facing the commanding presence of Ji He, Xu Jin felt inexplicably smaller, meekly asking, “Did I… do something wrong?”  

Ji He shot him a glance, but Xu Jin still didn’t understand.  

Finally losing patience, Ji He frowned disapprovingly at Xu Jin and said coldly, “Serve the dishes.”  

Xu Jin suddenly realized!  

It turned out Ji He was looking for him because Keke Wen had worked hard, and he couldn’t just let him eat for free.  

Feeling guilty, Xu Jin rushed into the kitchen, ready to serve up the dishes when Keke Wen finished cooking. Meanwhile, Ji He sat at the dining table like it was no big deal, waiting for dinner.  

Keke Wen was surprised at Xu Jin’s sudden enthusiasm but held no suspicions.  

After washing her hands, Keke Wen connected the smart device to the room where Taishu Jiyu was.  

A perfect visage of Taishu Jiyu appeared on the virtual screen, and Keke Wen couldn’t help but smile like a starry-eyed fan.  

“Ms. Ji, I sent Xia Ai to pick you up. Come join us for dinner!”  

Taishu Jiyu wasn’t surprised about the dinner invitation, having done her homework before coming to Blue Star. She understood that its inhabitants required cooking plants and animals to eat for energy—quite unlike interstellar beings who merely needed to drink nutrient extracts to thrive.  

Taishu Jiyu didn’t decline the invitation. After all, she was curious about food flavors; books said it elevated the spirit's essence.  

“Sure! Kitty!”  

Taishu Jiyu smiled lightly.  

Keke Wen felt as if her soul was being drawn away. Ms. Ji had a magnetic charm that utterly captivated her!  

Xu Jin, though already aware of Keke Wen’s many mysterious aspects, remained astonished. This was… high-tech!  

“Ahem!”  

At that moment, Ji He coughed twice.  

Keke Wen, coming back to her senses, looked over in surprise, “Mr. Ji, are you… sick?”  

Ji He looked at Keke Wen and replied, “No milk tea.”  

Keke Wen quickly realized she’d forgotten to prepare drinks. The spice must have made Ji He cough.  

Hurriedly, she retrieved four cups of milk tea from her space. Xu Jin’s gaze was laden with meaning, reveling in this delightful feeling of watching everyone else be entranced by Keke Wen while he alone remained clear-headed!  

When Keke Wen turned back to the virtual screen, she discovered Taishu Jiyu had already hung up.  

Just then, there was a knock at the door downstairs. Keke Wen began to stand up, but Xu Jin seemed to catch Ji He’s gaze and quickly ran downstairs ahead of her to open the door.  

“I'll get the door; you stay seated!”  

Seeing Xu Jin had already dashed off to the stairs, Keke Wen sat back down.  

She couldn’t help but wonder why Xu Jin was being so attentive today.  

Could it be…? Connecting Taishu Jiyu's enchanting image with Xu Jin’s changes, which started after she arrived today, made her suspicious…  

Could it be that Xu Jin was interested in Ms. Ji? Keke Wen’s pupils dilated in surprise…  

When Xu Jin and Taishu Jiyu returned upstairs a moment later, Keke Wen cast a pitiful glance at Xu Jin.  

Ah!  

So pitiful!  

Though Xu Jin was a nice guy, he was clearly not a match for Ms. Ji!  

Keke Wen couldn’t help but secretly lament for Xu Jin.
