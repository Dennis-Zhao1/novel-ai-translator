**Waiting for Someone on a Rainy Day (1)**

**New Year's Day**

Wen Keco woke up early today; a new year, a fresh start! 

When she made her way downstairs, she found Ji He already waiting by the dining table, just placing a bowl of freshly cooked dumplings down. 

"You’re up? The dumplings are perfectly cooked!" Ji He said, handing her a bowl of dipping sauce.

Wen Keco smiled at Ji He. “Why do you seem like a diligent husband already?”

Ji He gently pulled her into a chair and made her sit down. “Isn’t that what a man should do?”

In the center of the Alan Star System, due to the difficulty of reproduction, women with the ability to bear children held a high status. If a couple were to date, the man was expected to take care of the woman's daily needs and keep her spirits high. 

Even though Ji He had never been in a relationship, such expectations were normal for him after living in this environment.

Wen Keco raised an eyebrow. This was… fantastic!!! 

Haha, she hadn’t expected Ji He to have such awareness!

The two enjoyed a cozy breakfast together. Meanwhile, at the Zhao household, Zhao Congyun was pacing anxiously. He had lost contact with someone important, and it felt like they had vanished into thin air. They were in the house just yesterday, and today, they were gone. 

Zhao Wuxun sat on the sofa, his face cold. “How could they be missing? They were just in their room! What kind of incompetence is this? You’d be better off leaving it to your brother Congfei to handle!”

“Dad!” Zhao Congyun shouted back, frustrated. 

He was equally concerned about the disappearance. If things went well, he was the good son, but in tough times, he was worse than Zhao Congfei, who he considered useless. If it weren't for him, he would have been buried long ago.

“What do you mean it’s a small matter? I’ve never seen you handle any small tasks well yourself! Besides, remember, we're dependent on their help, not the other way around! And handing it to Zhao Congfei? He’s lucky if he doesn’t embarrass himself in front of that important person next time he sees them. I call you 'Dad' out of respect, but if you don’t want that…”

By the end of his retort, Zhao Congyun’s tone was fierce as he glared at Zhao Wuxun. Growing up, it was always Zhao Congfei who was favored.

“Then go ahead and live with him forever,” he thought bitterly.

Realizing he'd gone too far, Zhao Wuxun’s voice softened. “What nonsense are you talking? With that important person missing, should we…?”

Zhao Wuxun changed the topic. Zhao Congyun knew his father’s intentions but was drawn in nonetheless. However, the mysterious aura of that important person still weighed heavily on his mind.

“Absolutely not, we can’t afford to upset that person,” Zhao Congyun frowned. He had considered it but shivered at the thought of what that important person could do…

Just as Wen Keco finished her breakfast, Xu Jin sneakily entered. 

“What are you up to, Xu Jin?” she asked, perched on the couch.

Seeing Ji He was present, Xu Jin chuckled nervously. “Hehe, boss, have you tried the new dungeon from Summoner? It’s really exciting!”

“No, why?” Wen Keco replied, confused. She had missed out on the latest Summoner dungeon, which was developed by both Xingyun and Summoner, making her unfamiliar with its contents.

“Should we give it a shot? Mr. Ji can come too; it’s very interesting! Super thrilling!” Xu Jin eagerly suggested, urging the pair to join him. After playing, he almost forgot they were in the apocalypse!

Wen Keco was tempted; she had nothing pressing to do, as the Dawn Base was still under construction, and supplies had been sent over. With a flood season just beginning, it would be days before Starfall could produce anything, so why not enjoy some fun?

It seemed like ages since she had last played at Summoner’s since the new content was released…

Ultimately, she decided to go with Ji He, Lin Jiaojiao, and Tai Shu Jiyu to the Mecha City in Summoner.

[Dear Dreamland Host, welcome to the dungeon "Waiting for Someone on a Rainy Day." Special items "Rain Night Spirit," "You Are Me, I Am You," and "The Child of Time" have been prepared for you. Please check your inventory. Have fun!~]

As Wen Keco lay back in the simulation pod, she heard the mechanical voice and thought, huh??? This isn’t how Summoner’s supposed to work, right?

“Host~ I’ve looked at a bit of your Bluestar novels~ and combined them a bit~,” Xingyun chimed in. Wen Keco felt a rush of excitement; this new mode sounded thrilling!

She closed her eyes, ready to dive into the dungeon.

Wen Keco felt a surge of memories flooding her mind. 

Haiyan City, a coastal city in country Z, lay upon a small island. Due to its unique geographical position, the island would experience heavy fog once a month.

Whenever this fog rolled in, the city’s residents would stay indoors, waiting for it to pass. 

Recently, however, a series of gruesome events had occurred in Haiyan City.

Each time the heavy fog descended, a woman would be gruesomely killed, her body dismembered and neatly arranged. 

So far, three women had fallen victim, and the next foggy period was just ten days away.

Wen Keco’s new identity was Lu Xiaoyu, a second-year student at the best high school, Su Ning Yizhong. 

Her mission: Identify the murderer within five days.

Reward for completion: Gift box from the Lamp God.

Wen Keco rubbed her temples, feeling the pressure of new information flooding her mind. This was absurdly limited—and Ji He and the others were nowhere to be found.

Looking around, she was enveloped by the scent of disinfectant. The dim room contained a hospital bed covered with crisp white sheets, and beside it was a desk. This was… the school infirmary.

“Xiaoyu, how are you feeling?” 

As the infirmary door swung open, a bespectacled girl with short hair walked in, concern etched on her face as she carried a backpack.

This was Wen Qian, Lu Xiaoyu’s class monitor. As the top student in their second-year honors class, she had entered the infirmary after Lu Xiaoyu had collapsed from stress in class.

The monitor and Xiaoyu were good friends and often exchanged notes for studying. She had come to deliver the notes for their afternoon classes.

“I’m feeling much better, thank you, monitor,” Wen Keco replied weakly, putting on an act. The dungeon had just said that she shouldn’t break character; Lu Xiaoyu was shy and introverted, which made it a challenge for her.
