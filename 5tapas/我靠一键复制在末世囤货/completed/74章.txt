Beautifully Done

Lin Xiang'an sat up and took the porridge and steamed buns from General Wei's hands, gobbling down the buns with a hearty gulp of porridge, finishing it in just a few mouthfuls. 

General Wei looked at Lin Xiang'an's disheveled appearance, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes. 

"If it weren't for those Zhao family's wretches, you wouldn't have to endure this hardship, old Lin." 

Lin Xiang'an let out a satisfied burp, sighing as he replied, "Their weapons are way too advanced. We can't compete. To minimize unnecessary casualties, I had to hand over everything... If it weren't for me, sigh, it wouldn’t have come to this..." 

General Wei comforted Lin Xiang'an. "You don't need to blame yourself. Anyone in your position would make the same decision." 

Lin Xiang'an continued to lower his head and sigh. "The base has suffered over half its damage, all because of those Zhao people. Damn it, if I get my hands on them!" 

As he spoke, Lin Xiang'an's teeth clenched in anger. 

Just as General Wei was preparing to offer more comforting words, Lin Xiang'an coughed and said, "Ahem, old Wei, do you have any food left... I still feel hungry..." 

General Wei silently watched Lin Xiang'an before handing him more food. 

Meanwhile, Wen Keke and her companions had returned to their ship. Over the past few days, Ji He had been coming to find Wen Keke for various reasons, not doing much, just staring at her lips with an oddly intense gaze. 

As it usually ended, Wen Keke would ultimately grant Ji He his wishes. 

Today was no exception; with Ji He wrapping his arm around Wen Keke's waist, he sensed her low mood and softly asked, "Are you unhappy today?" 

Wen Keke buried her head in Ji He’s chest and replied in a muffled voice, "I just miss the pre-apocalyptic Huaguo." 

Having been in S City, it hadn’t really sunk in yet, but the Dawn Base had been relatively peaceful thanks to their own supplies. She hadn't expected D City to be in such chaos. 

This truly was the apocalypse... 

Cold, ruthless, devoid of humanity, only the survival of the fittest—if you’re strong, you thrive; if you’re weak, you deserve to die first. 

The environment of D City reminded Wen Keke of her previous life, struggling to survive under such harsh conditions. 

Ji He fell silent, knowing he was powerful in the interstellar realm, but he couldn’t turn back time. All he could do was silently hold Wen Keke, offering her some comfort. 

Two days later, they had spent a couple of days in D City and were preparing to return. 

The hundred thousand soldiers they had brought from the Dawn Base would remain in D City, as the order there was no longer peaceful like before the apocalypse. What it lacked was intimidation. 

General Wei was returning to S City with Wen Keke and the others, needing to report on the D City situation to Mr. Wang and the others. It was also during this time that General Wei learned of Wen Keke's plans to go to B City. 

“Miss Wen, are you sure you want to go to B City?” General Wei asked in a low voice, finding her standing on the deck. 

Wen Keke understood General Wei's concerns and reassured him, “Of course. Don’t you want the Zhao family to disappear?” 

“Of course I do, but their weapons…” 

General Wei’s face was filled with worry, wishing he could charge over to the Zhao family and take them out himself after seeing Lin’s situation in D City. 

But... he just couldn't handle them. 

Wen Keke smiled mysteriously, “How does General Wei know my weapons can't take them down?” 

General Wei looked surprised, noticing the smile on Wen Keke's lips and then realizing something. 

“I see, Miss Wen is the daughter of Lord Wen Jinshu!” 

How could Wen Jinshu not leave something for his own daughter? 

Once General Wei understood that Wen Keke truly was capable of dealing with the Zhao family, he excitedly rubbed his hands together, his eyes gleaming. 

“Ahem, I wonder if Miss Wen can take me along. I may not have much to offer, but I've got strength! If there's anything I can help with, feel free to call on me!” 

General Wei knocked on his chest, trying to prove his strength to Wen Keke. 

Wen Keke replied, “Of course, General Wei can come along. Hehe~” 

Wen Keke and General Wei exchanged mischievous smiles. 

At the Zhao family’s residence in B City, the Zhao family members were gathered around a table. 

“Third Brother, haven’t you contacted that Lord yet?” Zhao Wuxun asked his third son, Zhao Congyun, with a heavy expression. 

Zhao Congyun, looking scruffy and bloodshot, held a cigarette in his left hand, took a deep breath, and lowered his head. "No." 

He had no idea what was happening. He had been unable to reach that Lord, and though he had a hunch, he didn’t want to believe it. 

It was possible that the Lord... had abandoned their Zhao family altogether... 

“Third Brother, it's not that I want to criticize you, but you didn't do anything to anger that Lord, did you? It would have been better if I had gone…” 

Zhao Congfei, appearing as a portly, oily middle-aged man, hypocritically scolded Zhao Congyun. 

Zhao Congyan, Zhao Congyun's older sister, also chimed in, “Third Brother, think carefully if you've provoked the Lord in any way.” 

Seeing his third son's increasingly pale face, Zhao Wuxun shouted, “Enough! What use is there in saying this now? The priority is how to contact that Lord.” 

He realized they all relied on this third son, and it wasn’t the time to provoke him. 

Zhao Congyun scanned the room coldly and laughed, “You guys manage it. You’re all a bunch of useless fools.” 

Hearing this, Zhao Congfei stood up angrily, pointing at Zhao Congyun and shouting, “Third Brother, do you still recognize me as your elder brother?” 

Back when they were at home, the youngest would always defer to him. Now, he only had the Lord backing him, and with the Lord out of contact, hmph… 

Zhao Congyan, feigning concern, advised, “Second Brother, stop arguing, and Third Brother, you should say less.” 

Zhao Congyun surveyed the room full of people, feeling disgusted. He didn’t want to look at this living room any longer and turned to leave. Just then... 

“Boom—” 

The Zhao family’s villa was blown up. 

Wen Keke watched the Zhao family's villa engulfed in flames through live broadcasts and, confirming with Starfall that everyone inside was dead, couldn't help but laugh, “Beautifully done, Starfall!” 

General Wei, watching those disgusting Zhao family members vanish before his eyes, was initially incredulous but soon burst into laughter, “Hahaha! Beautifully done! Miss Wen! That bunch of scoundrels from the Zhao family is gone just like that! Hahaha!” 

The old master of the Zhao family probably never expected the culmination of his life’s schemes would end like this. 

“General Wei, now we should go collect our spoils!” 

Wen Keke took out an interstellar vehicle from her space and headed towards the direction of the Zhao family's location with General Wei, Ji He, Lin Jiaojiao, and Taishu Jiyu.
