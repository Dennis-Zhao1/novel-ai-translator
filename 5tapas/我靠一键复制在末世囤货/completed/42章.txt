**A Colorful Array of "Balls"**

After just a few seconds, the green ball began to glow, and before long it transformed into a... well, how do I put it...

Wendy's heart was half excited and half astonished.

Before her, in the open space, a... carnivorous flower appeared.

The house was overall round in shape, but at its base were about a dozen sharp teeth arranged menacingly, with a vine-like door leading to the inside, and two round windows on either side of the teeth.

The flower was predominantly red, with yellow petals and green teeth. This bizarre color scheme and strange design left Wendy stunned.

Stellar Whisper, who hovered beside her, said, "Master, actually the Huibing star system has some beautiful houses!"

Wendy was silent.

She quietly stepped toward the carnivorous flower, and only when she stood in front of it did she realize those sharp teeth were over two meters high. Wendy asked Stellar Whisper how to get in.

Stellar Whisper replied, "Master, place your hand on the highest tooth at the center."

Wendy followed Stellar Whisper's instructions.

"Verification successful!"

With a series of "click—click—click" sounds, the three central teeth retracted, revealing a red passage that led directly to the green door inside.

Wendy thought the passage resembled... a tongue.

Hesitantly, she stepped onto the passage and approached the door. As she stood in front of it, the vines automatically parted, revealing the interior layout.

A massive wooden cabinet was at the far right, and a wooden table of irregular shape sat in front of the windows, likely a workbench.

Above, a chandelier in the shape of leaves hung, and there was no kitchen; on the far left, a staircase led upward. Wendy climbed the stairs.

The first thing that caught her eye was a giant bed, probably made of wood, surrounded by green leaves and unknown flowers—strange yet somewhat beautiful.

In addition to the bed, there was a vine chair facing the window and a small table beside it.

Other than that, there was nothing else.

The entire room, though odd on the outside, felt relatively normal inside, as if she had entered a forest, filled with the breath of nature.

Wendy retracted this carnivorous flower and picked another green ball, hoping this one would be more aesthetically pleasing or, at the very least, normal!

She placed the ball on the ground, and the scene unfolded as before.

But where was the entrance this time???

Suddenly, a tree appeared before her.

It was a tree that looked quite similar to the surrounding ones.

About three stories tall, with branches surrounding it—there was no sign of a door anywhere!

Wendy took a few steps forward and was startled as the front half of the tree split in two to reveal a green eye, its gaze sweeping over Wendy from head to toe.

"Verification successful!"

After saying this, the eye also split in two, rotating ninety degrees before the tree itself moved to the sides like a sliding door.

As Wendy beheld the interior of the tree, her eyes lit up. This house, unlike the previous strange style, felt like stepping into an elfin home.

The furnishings inside were similar to those in the previous house, with tables and cabinets scattered about, but there were no chairs. Instead, there was a large woven mat.

Perhaps due to its height, there was a spiral staircase along the walls, with luminous pearls at intervals along the handrail.

In the center of the staircase, a sparkling mist flowed from the top to bottom, shimmering like fireflies, with no visible end in sight. It seemed to flow out of nowhere, adding a dreamlike quality to the entire space.

Wendy climbed the staircase to the second floor, where a bedroom awaited. The centerpiece was a bed covered by a semi-circular light shield, enveloping the entire bed.

Surrounded by an array of abnormally beautiful flowers, she gently touched one and discovered that these flowers were illusory, not real at all.

Continuing up the stairs to the top floor, she found a terrace that extended from the interior of the tree, with a railing made of intertwined branches adorned with blooming flowers and butterflies dancing gracefully.

Looking up, she observed the tree's branches hanging down, and she spotted cute squirrels hopping about. However, from Stellar Whisper, Wendy knew these were all projections.

Wendy couldn't help but marvel at the wonders of interstellar technology. The aesthetic of the Huibing star system truly was...

Astoundingly beautiful yet bizarrely strange.

Wendy stored the two balls from the Huibing star system in her space inventory. Though the carnivorous flower didn't quite align with her tastes, perhaps someone else would like it?

She decided to duplicate a few more. After all, she was now part of the interstellar homeownership club!

She took out the only remaining purple ball and placed it on the ground. Stellar Whisper said this was a house from the Yungui star system, particularly difficult to obtain among the four major star systems.

Wendy was curious about what the "portable tent" from the Yungui star system would look like.

The soft purple light gradually expanded. Wendy focused on that direction as the glow slowly dimmed but did not extinguish entirely.

Before her appeared a "planet" emanating purple light.

It was like Saturn, emanating a halo, with nebulous clouds slowly moving, as if the mysterious universe itself were unveiling its vibrant colors layer by layer.

The planet was a soft purple, subtly glowing on the outside, its light not overpowering but unforgettable.

It seemed to gently brush against her face and entwine her hair, weaving a fantastical and beautiful dream before her.

Wendy was astonished by what was claimed to be a house. Was this really a house? It could be considered an artwork beyond compare.

Standing where she was, Wendy didn’t move, but the distant house seemed to sense its owner. It slowly floated toward her.

You heard that right! It was indeed "floating" toward her!

It hovered directly above Wendy, casting a beam of purple light that enveloped her in an instant. In the blink of an eye, Wendy found herself inside the house.

Inside, the style was utterly different from the exterior.

If the outside was an exquisite piece of art meticulously crafted by a goddess, then the interior was like scrap tossed carelessly aside.

Wendy stood in a completely white space with two splashes of purple: a table and a bed—those two were the only furnishings in the entire room.

Though the interior was simplistic, Wendy adored this house because the breathtaking exterior was enough to move her; the interior could be decorated with her own touches later on.

She stored this ball in her space inventory and took out a blue ball along with a silver ball. Her anticipation for the silver ball was at its peak.
