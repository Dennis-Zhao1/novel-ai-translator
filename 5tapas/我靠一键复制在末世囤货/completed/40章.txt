**Stewed Goose, Braised Pork, and Pepper Fish**

After the transaction with the Huaguo base, Keke Wen posted an announcement in the community.

**"Starting tomorrow, construction of the Huaguo base will begin on the back mountain, with an estimated completion in two weeks. Interested parties can register at the base entrance after two weeks."**

The students in the community were all excited upon seeing the notice. 

"I knew the country wouldn't abandon us! I knew it!" 

"Finally! Finally, a base is coming!" 

Some students even cried out, "Wuwuwu... I miss Mom and Dad... wuwuwu..."

Keke Wen smiled as she watched the students hugging each other in front of the announcement. 

"Youth is great, isn’t it?" Jiajiao Lin approached from behind. 

Sometimes, the group from Huaguo didn’t leave with her, and they were currently living in Keke's villa.

Keke turned and smiled at Jiajiao, "Youth is wonderful, but we aren’t old yet."

Jiajiao chuckled, "Indeed!" 

They looked at the young boys and girls ahead of them; the passionate and vibrant expressions of youthful love were always radiant. Although they couldn’t express themselves so openly like these eighteen-year-olds, their hearts remained forever warm.

"I want to eat what you make!" Jiajiao leaned her arm casually on Keke’s shoulder. 

Keke readily agreed, and the two returned to the villa. 

Keke planned to make braised pork and pepper fish today, while also stewing a goose since it had been a long time since she had eaten goose meat.

She cleaned the whole goose by cutting it into pieces, washing it thoroughly. In a pot, she heated oil and added green onion, ginger, star anise, and dried chili. 

After stir-frying until fragrant, she added the cleaned goose, pouring in soy sauce and cooking wine, and stir-fried for ten minutes before adding beer and enough water to cover the ingredients for an hour of simmering. 

While the goose was stewing, Keke started preparing the braised pork. She roasted the skin of a piece of pork belly over the fire before cutting it into chunks, and in the meantime, she prepared the sauce for the braised pork. 

Keke took a bowl and added four tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons of cooking wine, one tablespoon of vinegar (to remove the fishy smell and make the meat tender), and one tablespoon of dark soy sauce, mixing it well before setting it aside.

Then, she heated some oil in another pot and added rock sugar, cooking over low heat until it melted completely. Next, she added star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, and dried chili to stir-fry until fragrant. She then poured in boiling water; thanks to Keke’s culinary gadget, she didn’t have to worry about oil splattering.

The reason for adding boiling water was that if she added the meat directly, it would turn bitter. Once the water was bubbling, Keke turned off the heat and set it aside. That was the braised sauce.

Next, she added a little oil to the pot, tossed in the green onion, ginger, and chili to sauté until fragrant, then added the chunks of pork belly, followed by the braised sauce she had just prepared. 

She also poured in the previously prepared sauce, adding enough boiling water to cover the meat, then simmered on low heat. During the process, she could skim off excess oil so it wouldn’t be greasy in the end, and as it reduced, she would pull out the spices and cover the pot to let it finish thickening.

Now it was time for the pepper fish. As usual, she reserved a portion of fish meat for Jinbao to eat.

She sliced a whole fish, then mixed it with cooking wine, a pinch of salt, some pepper, a tablespoon of starch, and a tablespoon of oil, marinating it.

She heated oil in a pan, fragrant with scallions, ginger, and garlic, then added bean paste until the oil turned red, followed by hot pot base mix, dried chili, and pepper, all sautéed together before adding water and boiling for five minutes.

After retrieving the ingredients, Keke added two tablespoons of soy sauce, one tablespoon of oyster sauce, half a tablespoon of pepper, and salt to taste, boiling before adding the vegetables and cooking them tender. Once the water was boiling again, she added the fish slices until cooked and placed them atop the vegetables.

Finally, she poured the fish broth over the dish, garnished the fish with pepper, red and green chili, and a sprinkle of chili powder, finishing with a drizzle of hot oil.

Keke clapped her hands, announcing that the stewed goose and braised pork were also ready. Just before Keke could lift the pot lid, Jiajiao dashed past her and opened the lid to transfer the food onto a prepared large plate.

"I'll handle this, you just focus on cooking," Jiajiao said, balancing the large plate toward the dining table with one hand.

Xu Jin came in to serve rice, while Ji He picked up chopsticks, making sure there was enough for everyone.

As for Taishu Jiyu...

"Hey? Has anyone seen Sister Ji?" 

It was strange; in the past, as soon as the meal was done, Ji would come rushing over, but today, with dinner ready to be served, she hadn’t arrived yet.

Just as they voiced their confusion, Taishu Jiyu entered the room carrying a dead deer. Keke’s eyes lit up; deer meat was excellent and beneficial for strengthening the spleen and boosting energy.

Taishu Jiyu placed a leg of the deer down in the kitchen before coming out. 

"I just happened to come across this. I took it down easily, and it seems fine to eat, so I brought it over. Little kitty, can this be eaten?" 

Taishu Jiyu asked Keke.

Keke nodded: "Of course! This is deer meat, which is good for strengthening the spleen and boosting energy, but don’t eat too much at once to avoid heat. Let’s save it for tomorrow; it won’t spoil in this weather."

Taishu Jiyu pinched Keke's face and laughed, "I’ll listen to you."

Seeing Taishu Jiyu pinch Keke's cheek, Jiajiao gave Keke a meaningful glance.

Ji He also exchanged a significant glance with Taishu Jiyu, clicking his tongue, as he sensed the oracle from the prophecy academy was starting to arrive...

The group began their meal, during which Keke introduced Jiajiao to everyone and introduced Taishu Jiyu to Xu Jin and Ji He.

After the meal, Jiajiao returned to the military base, as her duty was to be a soldier, and it wasn’t appropriate to linger at Keke’s home for too long.

"I'll see you next time, Keke," Jiajiao waved goodbye, smoothly getting into her vehicle and driving down the mountain.

Keke stood at the door, waving at the direction Jiajiao had gone, "Goodbye, Jiajiao~"

Ji He looked at Keke in confusion, "Aren't you going to see her again tomorrow?"

He had overheard them discussing how they would eat deer meat the next day, yet now they acted as if they wouldn’t meet for a long time.

Keke shot Ji He a glare, "You were eavesdropping on our conversation!"

Ji He looked a bit innocent, wondering just how loud their voices had been…

Women were indeed hard to understand!

Meanwhile, at the library, Hu Qingyun and Principal Li sat across from each other, both looking troubled.

"Principal, what… do we do?"

Hu Qingyun asked, head down, glancing at Principal Li, who was equally downcast.

Principal Li flipped through the stack of books on the table, breathing deeply, "What do you mean, what do? Just say it!"

With that, Principal Li sighed heavily.

Hu Qingyun mirrored the sigh, and they exchanged another meaningful glance, before both sighed together again.

"Alas!"

After a long pause, Principal Li looked at Hu Qingyun, "Why haven’t you gone to find Miss Wen?"

Hu Qingyun sat still on the chair, asking Principal Li, "I thought you would go."

Principal Li replied, "Do you think I’m old? Respect your elders, got it?"

Hu Qingyun countered, "Principal! It would be better if you went!"

"You go!"

"You should go!"

"You go!"

“You should go!”

Eventually, Principal Li conceded, "Fine, at my age, I guess I'll go~"

With that, he stood up shakily, preparing to head out.

Hu Qingyun suddenly stood up, "I'll go! You sit down!"

Principal Li turned back in surprise, "I should go! I’m getting old!" He began to walk away.

Hu Qingyun held Principal Li’s arm, gently pushing him back down, "I’ll go. You don’t need to fuss about it!"

With that, he left the library directly.

Principal Li chuckled as he watched Hu Qingyun exit, feeling successful, heh heh~
