**You Are My Tarta**

Winnie kept her eyes fixed on He Jin, unwilling to miss any of his expressions at that moment. 

She had confirmed over the past few weeks that she liked He Jin; otherwise, she wouldn’t have dragged him to dance while she was drunk that night, nor would she have granted him so many special privileges. 

Now that she was certain about her feelings, Winnie decided to take the initiative. Rather than slowly boiling like a frog, she preferred a swift and decisive approach. She sensed that He Jin might feel something for her too, so she wanted to confront the situation directly.

She hadn't planned on being this bold on New Year's Eve, but as soon as she stepped out of her room and saw He Jin, usually indifferent, standing there with a concerned look, asking if she was okay, she found herself inexplicably smitten. 

Who wouldn’t fall for a handsome man who showed them special attention? Especially when he looked so satisfied while eating her cooking, at times even endearing in his earnestness. 

Thus, Winnie resolved to voice her feelings. After all, isn’t liking someone uncontrollable? 

He Jin was momentarily taken aback when he heard Winnie say those words. 

Like... like? 

His heart tingled with excitement, as if a cocoon was breaking free and preparing to unfold its wings. He placed a hand on his chest, feeling his heart race because of her admission. 

He Jin's confusion transformed into realization—so this feeling was love! 

He felt discomfort whenever he saw her getting close to others, his gaze habitually searching for her presence. When she was happy, he was happy too; when she was sad, he wished to destroy the source of her sorrow, wanting to give her everything he had, coupled with a strong sense of possession, instinctively categorizing her as his property. 

So this strange feeling was actually love! 

He Jin wasn’t a sluggish person. Now that he recognized his feelings for Winnie, he gazed earnestly at her. 

Her eyes were slightly swollen from crying, her nose red, resembling a pitiful little bear, looking seriously at him with the confirmation of her feelings and the expectations secretly hidden within her heart. 

Understanding that Winnie liked him too, He Jin smiled softly, melting like winter ice, ushering in the warmth of spring. 

“Yes, I like you!” 

He Jin then reached for Winnie’s wrist, leaving her perplexed—wasn’t their relationship still unclear? 

Then, He Jin pulled out his space button, teleporting them to another location. 

As soon as Winnie materialized from the void, she was stunned by the breathtaking scene before her. 

She stood on a void, with sparkling stars drifting beneath her feet, varying in size and shape, forming a river that flowed towards the tranquil emptiness. They were like tiny mayflies in the galaxy, marveling at the wonders of the universe. 

Looking ahead, the space opened up to reveal vast blue hues, intertwined with other colors, vibrant and mysterious—a kaleidoscope unique to the cosmos. 

In the distance, a planet with a dusty yellow aura was Jupiter, while the beautiful blue planet was Blue Star, where Winnie was from. The sun glowed at its center, surrounded by floating debris, and far away was the swirling blackness of a mysterious black hole... 

Winnie was enchanted by the gorgeous view, as He Jin led her to a small crystal-like planet, sparkling and translucent, shining even more brilliantly in this mysterious universe. 

He guided Winnie to the highest point of the small planet, where a crystal flower bloomed atop a transparent peak. She wouldn’t have noticed if He Jin hadn’t picked it for her. 

“What is this?” 

Winnie took the crystal flower, feeling its coolness in her hand; it didn't feel as cold as it appeared. The flower petals were transparent, with flowing lights occasionally passing through and colorful mists surrounding it, giving it an ethereal quality. 

Taking a few gentle sniffs, she felt a refreshing sensation washing over her, as if cleansing her entire being. 

Winnie couldn't help but sigh, “What a beautiful crystal flower...” 

“It’s a Tarta flower.” 

He Jin gently brushed away a few strands of hair that had fallen across her forehead, gazing at her tenderly as he explained. 

“In the four major star systems, if two people promise to be partners, the man must present a Tarta flower to the woman, signifying that she is his Tarta, meant for him alone in this lifetime.” 

“Tarta?” Winnie whispered. 

“Tarta signifies that you are my heart. Interstellar humans regard it as a symbol of love. It is said to embody the most genuine love in the world; couples who possess a Tarta flower can be together for eternity. 

In the cosmos, it takes hundreds of years to produce a single flower; a new Tarta flower can only bloom after the previous one has been picked. Each Tarta star only bears one Tarta flower, and after it is picked, the Tarta star eventually fades into the universe, perhaps only to bloom a new flower after hundreds of years.” 

Winnie listened in shock at He Jin’s explanation, realizing the immense rarity of the flower in her hands. 

“He Jin.” 

Winnie snapped back to reality at the sound of his voice, looking up at him seriously meeting her gaze. 

“You are my Tarta.” 

The usually confident starship lord now had a touch of bashfulness and tenderness in his eyes, like a spring breeze brushing along Winnie’s heart, leaving warmth and affection in its wake. 

“I gave you my starship because I fell for you at first sight—I didn’t want you to struggle with driving. 

I sent you medicine when you were sick because I couldn't bear the thought of your discomfort.  

I gifted you starfall because I was unable to contain my feelings—only it can ease my mind. 

Dancing with you that night was because my heart was captivated; you were simply enchanting. 

I made you porridge because I lingered, recalling you said you love men who can cook, perhaps you’ve forgotten. 

I gave you the red crystal because it brought me joy to see your adorable glint when you’re money-conscious. 

Everywhere you go, I follow because I’m reluctant to part even a moment. 

Now, I stand here because I...” 

Winnie couldn’t take it anymore; she quickly covered He Jin’s mouth with her hand, her ears nearly steaming with embarrassment. Who would have guessed He Jin was such a smooth talker? 

“Because I... cherish you and want you by my side.” 

His deep voice whispered near her ear, and he removed her hand, taking hold of it instead. 

He Jin’s face lit up with joy, his teasing nature shining through, the strands of his long hair swaying slightly as he laughed, resembling a playful boy. 

Winnie looked up at He Jin, suppressing her own shyness, watching him intentionally beam to hide the bashfulness in his eyes. 

He was serious! 

That thought bubbled in Winnie’s mind, realizing He Jin was sincerely expressing his feelings, earnestly proclaiming she was his Tarta. 

As she thought about the word “Tarta,” her ears turned red again. 

Since He Jin had been so honest, she couldn’t back down. 

Reluctantly falling behind, Winnie intertwined her fingers with He Jin’s and smiled brightly, “Actually, you are my Tarta too!” 

Understanding that Winnie had accepted him, He Jin had never smiled so freely before. Though Anan hadn’t recalled him yet, they would create their future together. 

On the pristine crystal mountain, the young couple held hands tightly, gazing into each other's eyes, the fiery affection enveloping them, weaving frame after frame of a beautiful love story. The Tarta flower in their hands danced more brightly, bearing witness to their love in the boundless universe, where only they existed in each other’s eyes.
