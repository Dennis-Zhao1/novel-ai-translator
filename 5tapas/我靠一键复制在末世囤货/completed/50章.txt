**Dreamworld**

Back at the villa, although the mood of Mia Wu was still somewhat low, she had returned to her normal self. After all, getting upset over what others did would take a toll on her health. Since they wanted to destroy the Blue Earth and seize its resources, she decided that they wouldn’t get anything from her!

A sharp light flickered in Mia's eyes. 

“Meow!” Jinbao called out.

Mia looked down to see Jinbao anxiously circling around her legs. She picked up Jinbao and gently petted its head, recognizing that animals have a special sense.

Mia raised her gaze to the dark sky outside. It looked as if the heavens were merging with the earth, and the sea connected seamlessly to the sky. All around her, she could hear the rustling sounds of different animals flying in from afar, emitting sorrowful cries.

“Boom—Boom—Boom!”

The sound seemed to come from the ground, with the earth trembling slightly and the sky roaring. Mia squinted as she looked towards the distance, brushing alongside a white line.

The flood was coming.

Countless torrents of melted snow combined, rushing forth from the distance like an army crashing in with a deafening roar, the waves crashing and tearing apart the mountains. The raging flood was like a sharp blade heading straight towards Qijushan.

To Mia, it looked as if this giant beast was opening its mouth wide to devour her. The shock of the approaching wave was immense. Although she knew she had prepared well, she was still stunned by this scene unfolding before her.

Jinbao was terrified, burrowing deep into the crook of Mia's arm. She held Jinbao tightly, comforting it while a trace of worry rose within her. She wondered if the flood barriers would hold.

“You're scared.” 

A voice came from behind Mia. Turning around, she saw Ji He leaning against the doorframe, munching on something while looking at her.

For some reason, seeing Ji He so relaxed made Mia feel a little more at ease.

“Why would I be scared? I’m just a bit shocked since it’s my first time seeing such a scene.” Mia quickly put on a cheerful smile again.

Ji He said nothing but took a few steps closer, standing beside her and turning his gaze outside. He reached out to pat her head a few times, as if offering comfort.

Mia's smile lingered on her face, but she looked over in surprise to find Ji He maintaining a calm expression while looking out the window, as if he hadn't just patted her head.

Mia chuckled to herself, then turned her head to look outside as well. The three of them—a girl, a cat, and a boy—watched the tumultuous wind and furious waves, as if they were appreciating a graceful musical performance.

This feeling didn’t seem too bad~ 

Thanks to Mia and Huaguo's early preparations, there were no casualties in City S. The flood levels were indeed just as Mia predicted, below the flood barriers. The people at the base weren’t overly fearful; after all, this flood wasn’t nearly as terrifying as the extreme cold they had endured.

For the past few days, Mia had been busy with the construction of her Dreamworld, and finally, it was complete.

As Xu Jin excitedly exited the Dreamworld, he could hardly close his mouth—it was breathtaking!

It was so beautiful!

Not only would it become a global landmark in the post-apocalyptic world; even before the apocalypse, it would have been recognized as such!

Ji He didn’t show much expression, but his repeated visits were proof that things were going well.

Taishu Jiyu particularly enjoyed spending time at one location in the Dreamworld. Now, aside from eating, she was always there.

Mia was preparing for the grand opening of the Dreamworld tomorrow!

The people at the Dawn Base were already well aware of this. Even with the flood, their determination to dig for magma stones hadn’t diminished, and everyone was eager, ready to be the first to enter the park.

Mia had promised that the first person to enter the park would receive a mysterious prize. Though no one knew what it was, considering Mia’s usual generosity, the prize was bound to be special.

Finally, the opening time arrived.

The once warm neighborhood lawn had transformed into a large plaza, adorned with various sculptures, vending machines, milk tea dispensers, claw machines, and many entertainment facilities—all traded with magma stones.

Thousands of people were queuing below the plaza, each face filled with anticipation and excitement, without a hint of complaint or dissatisfaction.

Looking ahead through the crowd, a massive white barrier rose into the sky, obscuring people's view inward.

“It’s opening! It’s opening!” 

A man's excited voice shouted. 

The people in line immediately looked up, watching as a large red number appeared on the barrier.

【Ten,
Nine,
Eight,
Seven
...
Three,
Two,
One!】

【Welcome to Dreamland!
—Enjoy your time here~】

A gentle female voice filled the air, reminiscent of a soft breeze brushing by, offering a sense of serenity.

As the red text and soothing voice faded away, the white barrier gradually turned transparent, revealing the true face of Dreamworld!

“Wow!”

Everyone gasped in unison, astonished by what lay before them.

Countless colorful and translucent jellyfish floated in the air, varying in size. Sometimes they would swoop down close, only to elude touch and soar back into the heights, displaying their playful nature.

What surprised them wasn’t just the jellyfish but the largest pink jellyfish, which bore three enormous words on its head—**Dreamworld**. 

As the jellyfish's tentacles expanded and contracted, the letters changed colors, and these jellyfish were mobile, ensuring the grand name could be seen regardless of where one stood.

Beneath the jellyfish, there was a vast field of blooming flowers, swaying in the wind, each bloom too beautiful to trample upon. Rising above this floral sea were the entertainment attractions Mia had meticulously prepared:

Giant bunny buildings, fairies wielding magic wands, enormous mechs incorporating mechanical design, and towering banyan trees that could rain down starlight, accommodating thousands of people…

Countless fairy-tale structures emerged in front of the crowd, not to mention the various robots lining the streets that added scientific elements to this whimsical world.

Colorful flying cars zipped through the air alongside streaks of colorful light that painted the brilliant sky.

“Ha ha ha! I’m the first! I’m the first!”

The familiar voice shattered the reverie of the crowd. It was the excited man from earlier, jubilantly striding down the flower path as he yelled.

As he cheered, a beam of light descended from the sky, and a glowing butterfly fluttered down, eventually landing delicately before the man. It slowly transformed into a card that gently fell into his hands.

The man gazed at the card—a transparent piece that glimmered softly. He hadn’t seen a material like it before, but he noticed it bore the word **VIP** in bold letters.

Still, he was ecstatic, for this card was incredibly rare. They had heard stories of VIP cards for Dreamworld, noting only a few of Huaguo's top talents possessed one, yet that wasn’t the card’s most important aspect.

It was the profound meaning behind that card!
