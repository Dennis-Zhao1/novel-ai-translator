### Encounter

As the students excitedly left the supermarket, they were momentarily stunned by the sight of dozens of new buildings towering into the sky and a significantly expanded neighborhood. After a brief shock, they quickly returned to their usual selves. Everyone was already aware of Miss Wen's incredible abilities, so it was no surprise to them. At this point, if someone claimed that Miss Wen could create people with her bare hands, they would probably believe it.

On the other side, Little Ai's clones had finished building the walls, and after the silver mist from Wen Keke's space was replicated, she took it to spray the creations. 

Wen Keke arrived at the car rental area and set up ten interstellar buses, five mining machines, and a few tractors and excavators, along with mountain off-road vehicles. The vehicles were arranged according to their usage time, and points were paid accordingly.

After all that was done, Wen Keke felt too lazy to cook and simply brought out a feast of fried chicken, cola, hamburgers, and fries that she had ordered earlier, setting it up for herself and the four others, including Ji He.

It was Ji He's first time having such food. “Hmm? Tastes good!” 

After taking the first bite, Tai Shu Ji Yu silently quickened her pace of eating. Wen Keke watched everyone enjoy their meal with a delighted grin; as expected, no one could resist the joy of fried chicken!

Meanwhile, Sun Zhi, who should have been on this side in City B, was trudging toward City A. His eyes were bloodshot, his steps unsteady, and his face was bruised from the cold. His cracked lips bled, with frost collecting on his eyelashes as he carried a tattered military backpack and wore long boots, steadily making his way toward City A.

He was closer to City A than he had been. Initially, he had followed orders to go to City B to be with his family, but he never imagined the extreme cold would be so severe—City B was already buried under snow. 

City B was previously only a county-level city of City S, and it had only recently been upgraded to a city. No military had been dispatched yet, so City B was under the management of the garrison stationed in City S. 

Many died from freezing or hunger, while the rest had lost all sense of morality, and robbery and murder had become commonplace. Sun Zhi had relied on some martial arts skills he learned in the military to protection his family, but unexpectedly, his wife had long been involved with one of the gang members before the apocalypse.

Knowing they couldn’t take Sun Zhi in a straightforward fight, they colluded to trick him out and stole all the food and resources. When Sun Zhi returned home, he found nothing left. 

Furious, he intended to confront them, but when he learned that the gang had all been killed by a pack of beasts while hunting in the mountains, he was left all alone.

With nothing left to care about, Sun Zhi decided to see what General Wei was trying so hard to keep from him in City A.

He dug through some materials buried in the snow, loaded his backpack, and set off toward City A on a snowmobile. However, just before reaching City A, his snowmobile ran out of gas. Seeing he was so close, he got off and began walking on foot.

As he neared the toll booth of City A, he heard the sound of vehicles approaching from a distance—more than one, judging by the noise.

Trained and alert, Sun Zhi quickly found a hiding spot and crouched down to observe the direction of the sounds. 

From City A, a green military vehicle emerged, followed by a long line of others. Sun Zhi pulled out his binoculars to see inside the vehicle.

Could it be… Major Lin?

Sun Zhi had heard about Major Lin’s father, Lin Houde, having a good relationship with Chief Wang, and General Wei was directly aligned with the Wang family. Realizing they were allies, Sun Zhi quickly got up and ran to the middle of the road to stop the convoy.

Lin Jiaojiao waved from inside the vehicle: “Stop!”

The vehicle came to a halt, and Lin Jiaojiao signaled, got out, and walked forward while the convoy continued on, with one vehicle moving to the side, clearly waiting for her.

Lin Jiaojiao approached a man dressed in uniform but worn down by hardship and furrowed her brow: “Who are you? Why are you stopping the vehicle? If you’re heading to City A, you should hurry back.”

With someone finally descending from the vehicle, Sun Zhi felt relieved and saluted Lin Jiaojiao: “Report, Major, I am Sun Zhi, captain of the Ninth Team stationed in City S. Why should I turn back?”

Lin Jiaojiao’s demeanor softened somewhat upon hearing he was from the S City military: “City A has been blocked by the Zhao and Sikou families. We are currently evacuating survivors from City A to City S. Come with us.”

She had heard of Sun Zhi's name from General Wei, who described him as a rather reckless person. Yet, he was also considered part of the Wang family factions, so he was one of them.

“What about Chief Wang and the others?” Sun Zhi asked, feeling anxious; the Zhao family were not merciful people.

“Chief Wang and the others took another route to cover our retreat. You must get on the vehicle with us quickly; don’t waste any time.”

Understanding that he couldn't go to City A after hearing Lin Jiaojiao's words, Sun Zhi decided to join them in heading to City S, which would also give him a chance to regroup.

“Alright! I’ll go with you!” Sun Zhi agreed and quickly got into the vehicle with Lin Jiaojiao, following the convoy ahead.

In contrast to Sun Zhi and Lin Jiaojiao's tense situation, Wen Keke was quite relaxed. She was busy preparing cat food for Jin Bao.

She measured out fifty grams of peas and one thousand grams of chicken, boiled two hundred grams of chicken and two eggs in cold water, and steamed two hundred grams of bass. When the water boiled, Wen Keke lifted the lid and stirred the chicken with chopsticks to prevent it from sticking, then covered it again to steam for ten minutes.

After ten minutes, she took out a plate, retrieved the fish and eggs from the pot, and covered it again to simmer for another twenty minutes.

While it continued to cook, Wen Keke peeled the eggs and removed the bones from the bass. She chose bass because of its lower fat content and rich protein, which is easily digestible, containing plenty of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins, meeting Jin Bao's nutritional needs.

After twenty minutes of cooking, she added one hundred grams of chicken liver and one hundred grams of chicken heart, continuing to simmer for five more minutes. In the final minute, she added fifty grams of spinach.

A minute later, Wen Keke took all the ingredients from the pot, saving the broth to use later. She prepared a large iron basin, and once the meat cooled down, she shredded the chicken and pork by hand.

Next, she diced the chicken liver, chicken heart, eggs, and spinach into small pieces and added them to the basin, crushing the peas using a meat grinder and mixing them in as well, along with the boneless fish meat and ten grams of eggshell powder.

Using her hands, she mixed it all well. During the mixing, Wen Keke added some of the meat broth until the concoction reached a mushy consistency. 

While she prepared the food, Jin Bao kept circling around her. Wen Keke filled a small bowl for him, sealing the rest in a bag to keep in her space, so she wouldn't need to make cat food again anytime soon!

Watching Jin Bao gobble it up, Wen Keke couldn’t help but chuckle: “Jin Bao, you’re going to be a big fat cat soon!”

Jin Bao, upon hearing his name, replied between bites: “Meow~”

Wen Keke laughed and gently patted Jin Bao's head: “Go ahead, eat up! If you’re still hungry, we have plenty more!”
