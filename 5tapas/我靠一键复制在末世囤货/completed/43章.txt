**The Mecha House**

As soon as it was set on the ground, the spherical object emitted a series of mechanical clicks. The sphere gradually expanded until before Wena Coco stood a grand mechanical mecha.

The mecha was predominantly silver, with a left arm featuring a three-meter-long energy blade that could transform into a photon cannon. The right arm resembled a shield, and according to Star Phantom, this shield could also morph into a balcony.

In the semi-mechanical star system, mechas were a point of pride, not everyone possessed one. Thus, merchants who produced portable housing crafted some homes to resemble mechas in appearance. Of course, the offensive features paled compared to actual mechas, serving mainly decorative purposes. These houses, affordable and portable, were quite popular in the semi-mechanical star system.

Before Wena Coco could ask Star Phantom about how to reside in this mecha, the energy blade on the mecha's left arm slowly lowered towards her, revealing a door at the joint between the arm and the body that was just wide enough for a person to pass through.

Wena Coco stepped inside, greeted by a cold, mechanical aesthetic. Metal tables surrounded her, and there was a metal bed large enough for one person. Looking out the window, she realized she was positioned where the chest cavity would be.

There was a button on the wall, and Wena Coco pressed it. Suddenly, the area where the bed was located rose up and flipped over, revealing three large display screens and a jumble of strange buttons beneath.

In front of the screens stood a chair, flanked by several joysticks resembling those found in vehicles. Wena Coco sat down, and the screens brightened.

**[Welcome to Silver Light!]**

The screen then dimmed before displaying a 360-degree view of the surroundings, all transmitted in real-time.

Following Star Phantom’s instructions, Wena Coco grasped the left joystick and attempted to push it forward. The mecha house’s left arm lifted and swung forward slowly. Excited, she grabbed the right joystick and pressed forward again, launching the right arm's shield into action.

She glanced at the buttons in front of her and pressed one that caught her eye. 

“Zhi—ka—ka!”

The energy blade on her left arm retracted, transforming into a photon cannon. Curious, she pressed a button at the edge and watched as the shield flipped over, extending a patch of green… grass.

The shield transformed into a balcony adorned with grass, while a door on the right side of the interior opened up leading straight to it.

Wena Coco pressed the button to revert the balcony back to the shield's form. Suppressing her excitement, she quickly stored the sphere back into her space, fearing that if she didn't, she might lose track of time playing with it all day!

This was incredible!

No wonder it was renowned in the semi-mechanical star system.

Now only one blue sphere remained, showcasing the homes from her star system, the Eilan System.

Wena Coco set the ball down again.

In stark contrast to the previous spheres' sudden appearances, the blue orb gradually unfurled, spreading outward until it settled at her feet. 

Then, a blue light curtain rose, revealing a series of distinctly European-style castles. 

White-walled structures with terracotta roofs, the castles varied in height and were unevenly spaced, their black doors draped with red roses.

Pushing open the door revealed a fountain at the center, topped with a strange sculpture from which water gushed down.

Wena Coco felt a sense of familiarity with the sculpture but couldn’t place where she’d seen it before.

Walking past the fountain, she approached the main keep of the castle. The door stood open, leading to a long red carpet stretching inward, which she followed.

On either side were various sculptures of men and women, all differing but sharing the common trait of sporting identical smiles. Wena Coco felt that the curves of their smiles were eerily similar.

At the end of the carpet stood a striking female sculpture, far too large, forcing Wena Coco to tilt her head back to see it fully.

The statue wore a long dress, resembling the one she first saw on Tai Shuji Yu, her hair styled elegantly, adorned with a crown, her gaze benevolent as she faced forward.

The whole house exuded an atmosphere of solemn depth. Wena Coco inexplicably felt a sense of oppression and a strong urge to leave this place. She decided not to explore further and instead stored the house away.

Out of all the houses from the four star systems she’d visited, the semi-mechanical system’s house was her favorite—cool and impressive!

In contrast, the house from the Eilan System left her feeling stifled; while it appeared elegant and beautiful like a European princess, the sensation within was overly suffocating.

Of course, the dreamy purple house from the Yonggui system and the forest-style house from the Huiyue system also left a lasting impression on her.

After duplicating the spaces in her storage, Wena Coco prepared to redesign her fantasy garden, intending to place the houses according to their styles. Naturally, she would let Xu Jin select a set first.

Time flew, and soon the next day arrived.

Military vehicles from Huaguo continuously rolled toward Wena Coco's neighborhood, attracting a gathering of students on the roadside.

“They're coming, they're coming!” 

Optimistically excited.

“Wow, the driver is so handsome!” 

Shyly covering her mouth.

“Wuwuwu—this isn’t a trick after all!” 

Tears of joy.

Standing behind these energetic students, Wena Coco couldn’t help but smile at their spirited aura.

Behind her, David Wang asked with a grin, “Miss Wena, have you considered opening a school at the base?”

Wena Coco turned to him with a smile, “Oh? Do you have something in mind?”

Did he want her to open a school for his base’s people to attend and then return the favor?

Was she so selfless?

David Wang laughed heartily, “Hahaha, it’s not like that! I merely want to borrow something from you.”

Wena Coco didn’t respond, waiting for him to continue.

David Wang rubbed his nose and cleared his throat, “Cough cough. It’s just that due to the apocalypse, we left in such a hurry that we couldn’t bring any books, and the children at the base can’t do without them. I noticed you have a library in your neighborhood…”

Realizing that the people from Huaguo had their eyes set on her library, Wena Coco replied, “That might be possible, but bringing those books back took quite a bit of effort. I wonder what the compensation would be…”

She intentionally elongated her last words.

She had plenty of books in her space. The library was brought back with the foresight of future needs—after all, knowledge could change destinies, and education shouldn’t vanish due to the apocalypse.

David Wang understood her silent intent—he aimed to "buy" rather than "borrow."

“Well then, I know you need Magma Stones. How about we trade one book for one Magma Stone? You tell me how many you have, and we’ll exchange accordingly!”

They had also considered extracting energy from the stones, but ultimately, their technology fell short. No matter how powerful the resources were, they were unusable without the right tech.

Since renting the mining machines yesterday, they had been mining and managed to store quite a few already.

Wena Coco agreed, and the two arranged to complete the transaction once the base construction was finished.
