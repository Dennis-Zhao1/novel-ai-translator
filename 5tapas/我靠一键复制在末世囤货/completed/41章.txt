**Dreamland Park**

At this moment, Clara was preparing to "lend" the mining machines and magma mining tools to Huaguo.

Once everything was ready, she sent little Ai to deliver them.

On her way back to her room, Clara saw Yu Qingyun standing at a distance, pacing back and forth.

Clara walked over, puzzled. "Professor Yu, what are you doing here?"

Startled by Clara's voice, Yu Qingyun turned and immediately flushed red upon seeing her. 

"Clara... Miss Clara, I wanted to discuss something with you..."

His words came out stammering. 

Clara found this odd; what could possibly make a teacher, who once dared to rob for his students, so hesitant?

"What is it? You can just tell me."

Determined, Yu Qingyun quickly replied, "It's about how Principal Li and I have decided we want to go to the national base!"

Clara regarded him with a slightly odd expression. "That's it?"

Yu Qingyun froze, his expression stiffening. "That's... is that it?" He sensed a tone of nonchalance in Clara’s response, treating it as a small matter.

Clara nodded. "Yes, I never thought you would stay here for long. Wanting to go to the national base seems perfectly normal, doesn't it?" 

After all, Huaguo was the country she had survived in for so long, and anyone in their right mind would choose their home country. 

Yu Qingyun was momentarily taken aback, his eyes slightly reddening, and he said solemnly, "Miss Clara, I'm sorry!"

With that, Yu Qingyun hurriedly ran off. Clara, left bewildered, wondered, what was he apologizing for? What had just happened?

Meanwhile, Yu Qingyun's heart was heavy with guilt. How could he have thought so poorly of Clara before?!

Earlier, upon seeing the community Clara had built, his first reaction was not happiness, but concern.

Huaguo had fallen into chaos due to the apocalypse, yet Clara managed to create a community that resembled pre-apocalypse times, complete with a supermarket. 

Where had she gotten those supplies? What was her true intention behind it all?

Yu Qingyun had assumed Clara was the type to seize power in the chaos of the apocalypse, so while he felt grateful for her providing them food and shelter, he also harbored fear because of her methods.

Even amidst the apocalypse, he remained protective of Huaguo, feeling an obligation to uphold his nation's interests against any unsettling factors.

Thus, he was conflicted, filled with mixed emotions of gratitude and unease. 

Today, learning that Huaguo was going to build a base had brought him a sense of relief, indicating that the nation acknowledged Clara's existence and permitted her undertakings.

He and Principal Li both wanted to go to the Huaguo base since it was still more credible compared to Clara.

They felt somewhat guilty towards Clara since she provided for them, all the while they had contributed so little.

However, Clara was truly ambitious!

He realized he had been the narrow-minded one!

Clara, watching Yu Qingyun's retreating figure, suddenly thought, if the Huaguo base is built, then what will happen to her community?

No one would want to live there anymore!

Determined, she decided to discuss with Xu Jin.

Xu Jin pondered for a moment before asking, "Boss, what’s the purpose of your community?"

Clara stroked her chin and replied, "To earn magma stones!"

Xu Jin's mouth twitched. "Boss, with your high-tech capabilities, why not mine them yourself?"

Clara shot him an exasperated look. "If I mined them myself, I’d be done in a day! What would I do afterward?"

That sounded too boring, as she wanted to keep herself busy every day; at least she could manage her stockpiled supplies in a legitimate way without giving it away for free, maximizing their utility.

Xu Jin nodded but then added, "Actually, the most profitable thing isn’t real estate, but entertainment."

He leaned in, "Think about it. In the apocalypse, people must feel repressed. If you opened an entertainment venue where they could relax while trading for magma stones—which they don’t need—wouldn’t they want to come and have fun?"

Moreover, building an entertainment industry could include supermarkets, malls, and additional sectors that would regularly open and close, managed under stellar surveillance—convenient, right?

Clara considered his proposal; it was indeed enticing! 

"But what about the house you just bought? Where will you live?" Clara raised an eyebrow at Xu Jin.

Xu Jin was at a loss for words. "..."

Finally, Clara decided to take Xu Jin's advice: she would open an entertainment venue named **Dreamland Park**.

The vision was to give everyone a dreamlike experience.

She wasn't worried about whether people would come; as long as she had fun, that was enough. Plus, later, she could sell it to Huaguo with temperature-regulating gear, ensuring people could go out no matter the weather.

She learned from Huaguo that the apocalypse was orchestrated by extraterrestrial beings similar to them, which could either be halted or accelerated.

In the future, she would have corresponding strategies with Huaguo. When one becomes strong enough, no enemy can harm you, no matter how many schemes they concoct.

Regarding Xu Jin, Clara decided to create a housing area behind Dreamland Park. It happened that the Stellar Supervisor offered housing designs from the Eternal Rail Sector, Radiant Moon Sector, Half-Mech Sector, and Ailan Sector, each admired for distinct architectural styles.

She was quite interested in this; she'd leave one to Xu Jin as compensation.

Once they agreed on the plan, Clara also informed Taishujiji Yu and Ji He.

Taishujiji Yu, holding a mousse cake in one hand and a fork in the other, brought a piece to her mouth. "Does the little cat want a starry house?"

She could manage that!

Clara thought for a moment, "So... that seems like a good idea..."

She truly wanted a starry-themed house.

Stellar claims that houses from the Eternal Rail Sector shimmer like stars.

Houses from the Radiant Moon Sector resemble living in a forest, favoring plant life, with most designs reflecting that theme.

While Clara found the Stellar Supervisor’s tone a bit odd when discussing plant-themed houses, she was still quite curious.

As for the Half-Mech Sector, its design was, as the name implied, highly technological, akin to those from science fiction movies on Blue Star.

Due to the long royal history, houses from the Ailan Sector were castle-like in their style.

After hearing all this, Clara felt that the Half-Mech Sector designs matched her expectations best.

Upon Clara expressing her wish, Taishujiji Yu set her fork down, reached into her spatial bracelet, and pulled out several different colored spheres for Clara.

Curious, Clara asked, "What are these?"

Taishujiji Yu explained, "These are houses from the four sectors, portable like tents on Blue Star. They might be a bit rudimentary, but once you reach the Central Star, I'll give you the most beautiful house~ You just place this down on the ground."

As she spoke, Taishujiji Yu pinched Clara's cheek.

Clara's eyes widened in disbelief. "You mean these are houses?"

Taishujiji Yu chuckled, "Yep, little cat~"

Clara couldn’t believe she was holding several spheres that represented houses. 

However, she was very curious about the starry-themed houses. She made her way to the nearby villa, neatly storing away some vacant buildings.

She cleared a good-sized spot and placed one of the green spheres on the ground.
