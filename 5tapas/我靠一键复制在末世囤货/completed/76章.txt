You Are My Anan

February 2076. 

It has been a month since Wen Keke destroyed the controller. During this month, temperatures on Blue Star have returned to normal due to the destruction of the controller, but it remains quite cold, and everyone is still bundled up in their thick winter coats. The floods have gradually receded, revealing the submerged land below.

The Dawn Base has become the central hub of Huaguo, now referred to as Dawn City, symbolizing the light of dawn that follows darkness and representing Huaguo's survival after this apocalyptic event. Within this month, researchers, leveraging some of Wen Keke's exchange insights, developed the most suitable communication tool for Huaguo— the pseudo-light brain. 

The term "pseudo-light brain" is used because, while it can project virtual screens and connect to the internet like a true light brain, it doesn't possess the offensive capabilities that a starship's light brain has. Survivors from the military base in City D were escorted to Dawn City by the 100,000 soldiers previously dispatched from the Dawn Base. Now, the majority of Huaguo’s population is concentrated in Dawn City, with other survivors continually arriving.

Huaguo officials state that the most pressing matter at hand is recovery. Although the apocalypse lasted just over five months, it resulted in a loss of nearly ninety percent of the population. The human population on Blue Star is also drastically reduced because of this catastrophic event. For now, stability and reproduction are paramount. Those who have survived the apocalypse value security above all else.

Wen Keke's earlier acquisition of the Huijue Stone from Principal Li has now proven invaluable. 

“Dr. Gao! Our research has shown that the land within ten kilometers of this Huijue Stone has incredibly high activity! This means that anything we plant will sprout in just one or two days!” Han Huo exclaimed excitedly to Dr. Gao, who was observing the land nearby. 

Dr. Gao rubbed his hands over the soil and, with tears of excitement in his eyes, looked at the stone before him, proclaiming, “Wonderful! This can solve a big part of our issues in Dawn City! Quickly, tell Mr. Wang!” 

“Sure,” Han Huo replied. 

“Oh, and make sure to ask Mr. Wang if Miss Wen is willing to sell that stone! Whatever price, we’re willing to pay!” Dr. Gao added, tugging on Han Huo's sleeve for emphasis. 

Han Huo nodded, “Understood, Dr. Gao!” He was determined to get this done!

Meanwhile, Wen Keke was enjoying some quality time. Jin Bao and the gentleman were inseparable, leaving Wen Keke full of cat food. At this moment, Wen Keke was holding hands with Ji He, strolling around Dawn City. 

I must say, Huaguo has rebounded quickly. Within just a month, Dawn City is almost indistinguishable from City S before the apocalypse; it boasts shopping malls, cafes, hotpot restaurants, and various snack shops. The largest amusement park remains the Dreamland established by Wen Keke. It has become an irreplaceable place in everyone’s hearts, truly a dreamland during the apocalypse.

Due to her significant contributions during the crisis, Wen Keke has been honored as a “Hero of Dawn” by Huaguo’s officials. However, even without any official announcement, she was already an enigmatic figure in the hearts of the people as the mesmerizing Miss Wen.

“Ah He, I want that!” Wen Keke pointed at a nearby vendor selling candied chestnuts, playfully pouting. 

Winter’s top four snacks are candied chestnuts, roasted sweet potatoes, sugar-coated hawthorns, and hot milk tea—absolute necessities for the season. Ji He smiled at Wen Keke, simply standing silently without saying a word.

Wen Keke understood, exasperatedly facepalming. She should have known better than to bring Ji He along to watch dramas! 

Previously, out of boredom in the villa, Wen Keke had projected a romantic comedy titled “You Are My Sweet Turnip.” In it, every time the female lead needed help from the male lead, he would turn his face away and insist that she give him a kiss first. Ji He had picked up on this, so now, every time Wen Keke needed something, he would just stand still, waiting for her to kiss him.

Wen Keke stood on her tiptoes and lifted her head to kiss Ji He’s cheek, but unexpectedly, Ji He turned his head at that moment, and their lips met in a kiss.

“Wow! Boss, you two keep going!” Xu Jin, who had spotted them, couldn’t contain his laughter and hurried off, knowing that if he stayed any longer, Ji He’s dangerous glare would have been the end of him.

Wen Keke felt a bit shy at Xu Jin’s comment and was about to step back, especially with someone familiar nearby. Ji He wrapped his arm around Wen Keke’s waist, deepening the kiss.

A moment later, gasping for air, Wen Keke moved forward while Ji He followed closely behind, holding a bag of candied chestnuts.

“Wen Wen?” 

Wen Keke ignored him.

“Keke?” 

She continued walking ahead.

“Anan?” 

Wen Keke suddenly stopped and turned to Ji He.

“Anan?” 

Wen Keke squinted at Ji He, leaning closer to scrutinize him: “Who is Anan? Speak! Be honest, and I’ll go easy on you!”

Ji He took Wen Keke's hand and smiled, “Anan is you.” 

You are my Anan. 

Wen Keke was utterly puzzled. Anan? When did she have this name? 

Ji He pulled her back to the villa and explained everything about herself and the space she was in. Wen Keke finally learned the truth about her lineage. 

It turned out that her father, Wen Jinshu, was of the bloodline of Mang from the Ailan star system. The so-called Mang bloodline refers to a perfect replication gene. 

For thousands of years in the Ailan star system, due to the difficulty of offspring, and the Congression focusing more on strengthening the body, spiritual power has become increasingly weak. However, the Mang bloodline possesses a one-to-one replication ability, capable of copying others' spiritual power and directly combining it with potions, allowing one to inherit all the excellent genes, including spiritual power from the replicated person. 

Centuries ago, the Congress discovered the Mang bloodline, and due to its rarity, they imprisoned all individuals with this lineage, often referred to as spiritual messengers. The Congress extracted blood from the Mang bloodline to replicate others' excellent genes for self-enhancement. 

Wen Jinshu had escaped from the Congress when its secrets were exposed to the public, and during his escape, he met Wen Keke’s mother, Tai Shu Wanqing, which led to her birth. 

“What about my grandparents? Where are they?” Wen Keke asked, confused. 

Ji He smiled gently, “There are realistic robots in the Ailan star system. If I'm not mistaken, your grandparents should be those robots.” 

Wen Keke understood now; no wonder she had never seen her grandparents fall ill and why they were healthier than other young people in their twenties. 

“And you? Why are you here?” Wen Keke looked at Ji He. 

“Because you are Anan!”
