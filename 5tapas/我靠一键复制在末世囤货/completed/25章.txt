**Supermarket Grand Opening**

After settling the shopping arrangements, the next step was to focus on selling products. 

At the entrance of the supermarket, Vanilla Wen had set up a sweet potato roasting machine! After all, who wouldn't want a hot, sweet roasted sweet potato in winter? Initially, she had no idea about the space's duplication ability, and so she had stocked up on a large quantity of sweet potatoes. Since the base amount was substantial, the quantity being duplicated was immense; now, the sweet potatoes in her space seemed endless.

Vanilla thought it might be a bit lonely to only have the sweet potato machine. "Let's add a milk tea machine too!" She instructed Starfall to input the necessary data for making milk tea. By simply entering the name of the milk tea on the machine's screen, points would be deducted accordingly, and customers could pick up their drinks from the collection area. 

Satisfied with her arrangements, she began stocking shelves. The supermarket featured five rows of shelves right at the entrance: one row for drinks, one for snacks, one for toiletries, another for women's products, and one for condiments. As they moved further inside, there was a large self-service area filled with various snacks. Adjacent to this area were sections for vegetables and fruits. 

Deeper in the store was the fresh produce section, and right next to it was the dried goods area. At the far end, there was a row of large freezers containing all kinds of ready-to-eat meals and hot pot ingredients. Vanilla completed the food and drink arrangements for the first floor before retrieving backup supplies from her space to place in the storage area behind the supermarket. From there, Starfall would handle future restocking tasks.

She then went to the second floor, where her attention was immediately caught by the bedding section—big, fluffy comforters! They came in various thicknesses—super thick, thick, and thin. To the left was the clothing section, offering winter apparel for men, women, and children. To the right was the home goods section, featuring everything from furniture to pots and pans. Given that Vanilla provided conditions for "buying a house," the required points ranged from 300,000 to 500,000, with plans to later expand accommodations to include standalone villas.

After everything was set up, Vanilla asked Starfall to check the generator and solar panels to ensure they were functioning correctly. 

"Master, everything is normal," Starfall replied in its mechanical voice.

Looking at the supermarket she had established herself, Vanilla felt inexplicably excited—she was now the proud owner of a supermarket!

Oh! She suddenly remembered that she hadn't put out the tools for mining magma stones. It wouldn’t do to rely solely on manual labor for that. Noticing that the right side of the supermarket entrance was still empty, she took out the tool tags made by Starfall. Since the magma mining tools were too large to be kept in the supermarket, Starfall had created these tags. Once swapped, users could take the tools outside by simply presenting the tag. 

The tools included a snow-melting agent, as the ground was covered in snow, along with professional mining equipment and accompanying power sources. This entire set would take about an hour, costing 20 points, while the snow-melting agent was charged separately; no need to worry about overuse, as the equipment would shut off automatically after the time was up.

At that moment, Rick Xu arrived. After all, this would become his workplace, and he came to check it out. He wasn't as afraid of the cold anymore, thanks to Vanilla, who had given him a temperature-regulating potion for his role as the inn manager. 

He was astounded by how quickly the potion raised his body temperature. However, given how brutal the cold had been, Rick was still bundled up in a thick down jacket.

Looking at the supermarket, which bore no resemblance to the desolate world before, Rick's eyes revealed a mix of emotions. He had mentally prepared himself to live in the apocalypse for the rest of his life. Yet here, with Vanilla, there were warm clothes, delicious meals wafting in the air, and soft beds—he felt incredibly content.

Now, with a supermarket and the library he'd seen before, he held hope for more possibilities in the future… He thought that even if Vanilla had some extraordinary means, what did it matter? Only she could allow him to live with dignity, like before the apocalypse. 

Struggling to survive had reduced many to mere shadows of their former selves. For Rick, this was a place where he could hold onto the remnants of what little self-respect he had left. In his heart, Vanilla was someone he would respect and support for the rest of his life.

Turning to Vanilla, Rick smiled. "You did a great job, Boss Wen!"

"Of course! I'm the eldest daughter of the Wen family!" Vanilla replied proudly, crossing her arms and lifting her chin.

As Rick inspected the supermarket, he approached the points exchange machine and pulled a gold bar from his pocket, inserting it into the machine.

"Beep! Detecting... 
- Name: Gold
- Weight: 116.64 grams
- Points: 933.12
- Account Balance: 933.12 points
Have a nice day!"

Magma stones exchanged for ten points per gram, while gold, treated as an important mining resource, was valued at eight points per gram. After taking the temperature-regulating potion, Rick had accompanied Vanilla to his family’s weapon storage to retrieve all the weapons, as well as gold and silver from the safe. She had informed him that these would serve as the circulating currency for the inn.

Rick had enough gold on him to last a lifetime. Not to mention, Vanilla paid him a salary every month and provided for his meals. His job was to welcome guests and handle their various issues, essentially serving as the customer service for their warm inn. 

Rick was quite satisfied with this job. 

He looked at the point balance on the machine and raised an eyebrow; he planned to exchange more points to buy a house. After all, he couldn't keep living at Vanilla's place forever. As an internal employee, she granted him a 25% discount, meaning the best house could be purchased for just over 370,000 points. Rick had reserved his new home.

In response to Vanilla's puzzled glance, he retrieved 402 gold bars from his space storage, ready to exchange them all.

Indeed, it was space storage! Vanilla had received it from Starfall. In the interstellar world, space storage was commonplace, and Starfall had plenty to offer. Vanilla planned to open an interstellar shop once she had more customers, focusing on selling high-tech products from the cosmos.

She had given Rick one of the space storage units as an employee benefit, capable of holding items the size of a football field.

"Beep! Detecting...
- Name: Gold
- Weight: 46889.28 grams
- Points: 375114.24
- Account Balance: 376047.36 points
Have a nice day!"

Rick promptly selected to buy the three-story house next to Vanilla's villa.

"Beep—
Your purchase is being processed. Transaction complete!
- Transaction Amount: 375,000 points
- Account Balance: 1,047.36 points."

With the house secured, Rick felt a great weight lift off his shoulders. He looked at Vanilla and smiled. "Looks like we'll be neighbors from now on!"

Vanilla returned the smile. "Congratulations, Manager Xu! Prosperity for you!"

With that, she took out a small folding vehicle from her space and gifted it to Rick. "A housewarming gift!"

Rick's eyes brightened. The supermarket boasted many products, but the high-tech items and weapons Vanilla had stocked were still hidden from public view. He had been eyeing her interstellar vehicle for quite some time.

Feigning nonchalance, he adjusted his buzz cut and coughed lightly. "Oh, there's no need for such gifts..."

Yet his eyes kept gravitating toward the folding vehicle in Vanilla's hands.

Vanilla elongated her tone, "Oh~ since that's the case..."

Rick, not wanting to let her finish her sentence, swiftly accepted the folding vehicle from her, saying flatteringly, "Hehe, a gift from Boss Wen? I can’t refuse! I'll take it gratefully! Hehe~ You can count on me to work hard!"

Rick promised Vanilla, feeling a surge of gratitude. He knew this gesture was specifically meant for him, reaffirming his determination to help Vanilla in every way possible.
