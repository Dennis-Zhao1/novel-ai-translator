**Return to Zero**

甘岚岚 felt like she had slept for a very long time. When she finally lazily opened her eyes, everything was just a blur, with a flash of white light dazzling past her. 

When she came to her senses, she found herself on a hillside, standing bewildered at the stone steps below her. 

Wasn’t she already dead? Where was this place?

Right!

“Si Si, Si Si, are you there?” 

As she called out repeatedly, a young boy in a light blue robe was making his way down the stone steps, swinging a piece of foxtail grass in his hand… mumbling to himself!

“Why do my senior brothers and sisters always bully me, sending me to fetch people? It’s been hundreds of years, and not a single person has passed our mountain’s entrance test. Where are they, where? Oh? Wait, there really is someone!”

With a toss of the foxtail grass, he charged down towards 甘岚岚. 

Startled, she instinctively leaned back as a face suddenly appeared in front of her.

“Wow, are you the new junior brother?” 

Realizing he might have frightened her, the boy, named Lin Yu, took a small step back—well, half a step, really!

Looking at the little ragamuffin in front of him, he couldn’t help but feel excited! 

After all these years, being the youngest in the sect and only running errands for his senior brothers and sisters… he had endured so much! 

Now, with a smaller junior brother coming in, he felt like he was finally free! Hahaha!

“Are you talking about me?” 

甘岚岚 snapped back to reality, a flicker of memories flashing through her mind: from a wealthy and happy family to everything being burned in a great fire. She vaguely recalled being led by Big Niu and the others, her mind clouded…

“Yes, that’s you, junior brother!” 

Lin Yu eagerly nodded, flashing a bright smile with his pearly white teeth!

Originally, he planned to help the young-looking junior brother up the mountain, but upon seeing the dirty appearance of 甘岚岚, he hesitated. 

So, he casually performed a cleansing spell, “Purify!” 

The originally grimy child finally revealed her true form: a fair-skinned little face with baby fat. Although her clothes were a bit tattered, it didn’t detract from her cuteness!

Before 甘岚岚 could recover from the “magical cleaning technique,” Lin Yu grabbed her hand and dashed up the mountain.

“Hahaha! I’m your senior brother, Lin Yu. Hurry, let’s go find the others. After all these years, we finally have a junior brother!”

Along the way, Lin Yu chattered about many things. He talked about how only he and his senior brothers and sisters were on the mountain, and they hardly paid him any attention, only concerned with researching flowers and plants. How boring!

They had all grown up on the mountain, while their master, Master Qingyang, was always traveling outside. 

According to Lin Yu, their master must have found everyone too boring and decided to seek enjoyment elsewhere. 

He lamented how unfortunate he felt—no one to play with and always under pressure from his senior brothers and sisters to study those flowers and plants, which he found utterly unenjoyable. 

He wished to study swordsmanship at Wan Jian Mountain, believing that it would be the coolest thing ever. However, he didn’t dare! 

One, because he had no talent—his combat ability was pathetic! 
Two, because his father was an elder at Wan Jian Mountain, and he did not want to get beaten to death by him—his natural elemental abilities were too powerful. Any good sword that came into his hands would rust or break! 

In short, he was a failed sword! 

His father had many cherished swords ruined by him, and unable to endure the burden of such a troublesome son, he hastily packed him off. 

They reached the mountaintop quickly, but Lin Yu had not considered 甘岚岚’s frail constitution. After dragging her up, she collapsed to the ground, panting as she surveyed her surroundings.

The housing here was quite nice—platforms and pavilions, elegant and comfortable. 

After all, those with special elemental abilities were mostly connected to the Lan Mountain Sect.

At this moment, a man and woman sat in a pavilion; the woman was arranging flowers, and the man was playing the zither, creating an atmosphere of tranquility.

Even for 甘岚岚, who had yet to fully shake off the memories of the apocalypse, the entire world seemed to calm down. 

All she wanted to do was slow down, enjoy the mountains and clouds, sip some hot tea, read a book, and appreciate the flowers…

“Senior brothers and sisters, look who I brought!”

Unfortunately, that peaceful moment was shattered by Lin Yu’s loud exclamation.

Wen Gu paused his zither playing to tidy up the instrument, while Wen Zhi stopped arranging the last flower. 

Both turned in unison to look at the source of the excited voice.

Behind the ecstatic Lin Yu was a small figure, though collapsed on the ground, her whole being radiated a natural energy that made people want to approach her, and they couldn’t help but feel a bit surprised. After all, after hundreds of years without a new person entering, even Master had given up hope, yet here was a new junior sister!

Indeed, the brother and sister duo were unlike Lin Yu, the naïve boy who mistook a girl for a boy.

After resting for a while, 甘岚岚 finally mustered the courage to get up, feeling quite embarrassed to remain seated on the ground in front of the gentle-looking pair.

Wen Zhi stepped forward, taking the little girl’s delicate hand and guiding her toward their living quarters.

“It’s rare for our sect to have a junior sister come, so it’s a waste I had to prepare a room early. You must be tired after the journey! Come, let my sister take you to wash up and rest. Tomorrow, when Master arrives, we’ll formally greet him.”

“Wait??? Junior sister? No, no, isn’t it junior brother?” 

Lin Yu looked at the two girls walking hand in hand and then at his dear brother, wanting to verify whether he had heard wrong.

Wen Gu shook his head and followed along.

“I’ll go see the junior sisters!”

“I… I’m not a junior brother?” 

Then, he suddenly seemed to remember something, his frown morphing into a silly grin, but it was fleeting.

“I have a junior sister! I have a junior sister! I have a junior sister!”

Wearing the clean, comfortable clothes given by his senior sister and lying on the bed, 甘岚岚 finally had the time to sort out her thoughts.

In her past life, there had been endless books and exams. Just when she thought she had finally made it through university, she faced the cruel reality of unemployment. After working hard, dealing with high-rises, public transport, and the allure of milk tea, cake, fried chicken, and cola…

In the apocalypse, there were struggles for survival, growing sugarcane, fighting zombies, and coping with an icy world… and in the end, everything vanished.

In this life, as a little child, adored by her parents, enjoying toys and sweet treats… then came a great fire that destroyed everything.

Memories flashed through her mind, connecting many previously incomprehensible events! 

In fact, she had come from the modern world, enjoying fried chicken and cola, and somehow ended up traversing to this realm! 

But she hadn’t crossed into the apocalypse; instead, she found herself in the world of cultivation!

甘岚岚, as a local ordinary person from this cultivation realm, lived in a wealthy landlord’s household with loving parents. 

However, a group of thieves had long set their sights on their family’s wealth—the fire, the bloodshed, the looting—all became ash with their home in flames. 

Due to her parents’ kindness, they managed to hide her just in time during the chaos, allowing her to escape thanks to Big Niu and the others. 

At that moment, she had already been traumatized, and following the group into the trial grounds, the fearful memories from the fire surfaced, sending her spirit into disarray... ultimately becoming a pivotal moment!

Thus, the modern 甘岚岚 transformed into the sweet little girl 甘小可怜, embarking on a trial of survival in the apocalypse!

So, 甘岚岚 had traversed here through the trial, which explained why she struggled to recall anything upon her arrival to the apocalypse. Being a modern person, her inner demons conjured an apocalyptic world.

Modern memories were blurry, while those of 甘小可怜 felt like an observer watching someone else’s life, as if she had been watching a film. 

She couldn’t tell if it was because she had just passed the trial that her memories of the apocalypse were so vivid, yet many details slipped away!

All in all, her thoughts were jumbled, both clear and hazy!

“Ah, it feels like everything from two lifetimes has been cleared away, allowing me a new start! How difficult it’s been for me~” 

Muttering softly, she quickly drifted off to sleep.
