**Chapter XX: The Feast of Mount Wanzhi**

"How often does one get to hear about the cultivation of immortals?" 

“Lan’er, come here to greet your Master and Senior Uncle. You've met him last time too.” 

Hastily putting down the fruit plate, she said, “Greetings, Master and Senior Uncle!” 

“So it’s Lan’er, right? No need for such formality! We’re all family here. Come, sit down and eat!” 

If you don’t hurry up, I’ll just have to watch everyone eat! The spread is so enticing! 

After all, Qingyang is very protective of his food—oh no, I mean, protective of his little ones!

“Senior Brother Qingyang, now that everyone is here, can we start the feast?” 

Qingyang looked quite displeased, responding casually, “Then let’s start!” 

Who could blame him? After all, he is the Head of Lanshan Sect! 

He quickly gave his disciples a knowing glance and transmitted a message: 
"Be quick about it! Don’t let anyone else snatch up the food Lan'er made!" 
"Don’t worry, Master!" 

Lin Yu was the most lively; his eyes twinkled with mischief. He used serving chopsticks to pick up a large, succulent spirit pig trotter and presented it to Master Xuankong: 
“Master and Senior Uncle, please try Lan’er’s cooking! I’m not exaggerating; it’s absolutely delicious!” 

“I’ve heard the food at Wanzhi Mountain is exceptional. Qingyang, you’ve gained a bit of weight lately! Seeing the food today, it truly lives up to its reputation! So I must indulge!” 

Qingyang’s forehead was furrowed with a big hashtag! He almost forgot about their brotherly bond and had the urge to give his Senior Brother a good beating! 

But fearing the ire of the Lanshan Sect’s gossip committee, he managed to restrain himself! 

Hmph, "gained a bit of weight," that’s just because he hadn’t been going down the mountain as much and wasn’t as worn out as before! Just a small amount of extra weight, really!! 

“Master and Senior Uncle, please!” 

Xuankong buried his head in the trotter, savoring the tender and succulent meat; the soft texture was truly magnificent! Unable to resist, he indulged a few more bites! 

This spirit pig trotter should be found only in the heavens! How rare are such delights in the immortal world? 

“This spirit pig trotter…” 

He raised his head, ready to express his amazement, only to be taken aback by the shocking scene before him! 

In the time it took him to munch on half a trotter, how did everything change!? 

The table that had been laden with chicken, duck, fish, and wild game…how could it be completely empty now? 

Perhaps sensing his shock, Qingyang coughed lightly, still pretending to be innocent: 
“I’m sorry, Brother. The kids returned, and they do eat quickly!” 

Was that “quick”? The dishes were all clean! The empty plates were shining bright! 

Not only that, but Qingyang also pretensively pushed forward a plate of cut sugarcane: 
“This sugarcane is a specialty of Wanzhi Mountain, perfect for after a meal. Please have a taste!” 

Xuankong: “I… I’ve only eaten half a trotter!” 

Qingyang nodded, “If you want to pack some, we have plenty of sugarcane! Lan’er, prepare some for your Master and Senior Uncle.” 

“Sure thing!” 
Lan Ci, leaving her seat (x1)! 

— 

Xuankong: “No…” 

Qingyang looked puzzled: “No? Oh, you want some desserts? Zhi Zhi, prepare some for your Master and Senior Uncle.” 
“Yes, Master!” 
Wen Zhi, leaving her seat (x2)! 

— 

Xuankong: “I’m not looking for desserts…” 

Qingyang was perplexed again: “Is it tea you want? A'Gu has plenty of good tea; we have ample supply! A'Gu, prepare some for your Master and Senior Uncle.” 
“Got it, Master!” 
Wen Gu, leaving her seat (x3)! 

— 

Xuankong: “I haven’t even eaten…” Just a half! 

Qingyang, deeply confused, asked, “Not enough? Then how about some spirit chicken soup? It’s quite tasty! Thankfully, there’s still one bowl left. Yuer, serve your Master and Senior Uncle a bowl! Remember, just one bowl!” 

Lin Yu had already dashed into the kitchen; his playful voice echoed in the distance: 
“Don’t worry, Master! I know it’s just one bowl of soup left in the pot!” 
Lin Yu, leaving his seat (x4)! 

— 

Qingyang exclaimed, “Brother, look! There’s still soup! I guarantee you’ll be satisfied!" 

Xuankong sighed, “But I only managed to eat half a spirit pig trotter!” 

Qingyang frowned: “Do you want something else? Brother, it’s not right. Eating this and wanting more doesn’t sound good!” 

While saying this, he took out a jar of wine, reluctant to part with it: 
“Fine, fine, since you are my Senior Brother, I’ll make sure you’re accommodated! This sugarcane wine is a rare item, specially made by Lan’er; it’s one of a kind in the immortal realm! I’ll give you a jar, and I only have one jar left! I truly have no more!” 

“Qingyang…” 

“Alas, Senior Brother, I really don’t have more! You mustn’t mention this to the others; otherwise, I’ll be out of stock!” 

As he spoke, he almost shed tears, reluctantly extending the wine slowly towards Xuankong! 

“…” 

Xuankong was speechless for a moment and finally put down his chopsticks, “Fine, hand it over!” 

With a swift motion, he snatched the wine! 

“Junior Brother, you’re so stingy, really…” 

“Hehe! Senior Brother, you see, in the end, it’s merely a joke! My stockpile isn’t plentiful, so please bear with me!” 

Xuankong shook his head, “You haven’t changed a bit!” 

Meanwhile, on the other side of the kitchen, Lan Ci was dumbfounded! 
“Middle-aged people—oh no, I mean, middle-aged cultivators are just as trivial!” 

Wen Gu patted the small junior sister’s shoulder comfortingly, “You’ll get used to it!” 

“Alright, back to business! We’ve come to discuss the arrangements for the group from Monster Village.” 

Once the conversation turned serious, Qingyang seemed entirely focused. 

“Senior Brother, is there something specific that Wanzhi Mountain requires? After all, you never easily visit us, thinking our Wanzhi Mountain is bland and lifeless!” 

Qingyang chimed in, “I’m quite resentful!” 

“Ahem, there are indeed matters at hand! You see, the celestial alliance is aware of Monster Village's situation and will communicate with the Yamato Clan soon. However, currently, the placement of these 22 individuals is a problem. According to protocol, they ought to be settled at the base of the mountain.” 

Qingyang nodded, “That’s how it should be!” 

“However, South Hua Senjun disagrees.” 

Qingyang was taken aback: “Why?” 

“You know their circumstances; they are unique and, many are of old age. Sigh, just getting to the base, and several have fallen ill already!” 

“Those at the base haven’t done anything, yet they are clearly avoiding these folks. I initially planned to allocate a specific area for them, but Senjun said…” 

“What did Senjun say?” 

“Senjun said: Wanzhi Mountain is blessed with talents and resources, making it the most suitable place for nurturing individuals!” 

“Ah, this…” 

“Moreover, Senjun insisted that these individuals must be alive! Not only must they live long, but they must also live well! I’ve instructed Xian Dan Ding to concoct some pills for them, and their provisions have also been arranged. The remaining issue is accommodations…” 

Qingyang glanced at his Senior Brother's kind expression, considered his disciples, especially the eager eyes of his young disciple. With a decisive bang on the table, he declared: 
“Let them come to Wanzhi Mountain! Our Wanzhi Mountain has beautiful scenery and flowing waters; there’s no better place in the entire Lanshan Sect for them to spend their twilight years!” 

“Wonderful! That was what your Junior Brother hoped for! I knew your heart was kind. I’ll go and tell them after I finish eating.” 

Then, he shouted towards the kitchen, “Where’s my chicken soup?” 

“…” 

After finishing the spirit pig trotter and chicken soup and carrying the sugarcane wine, Xuankong hummed a tune as he left. 

As he reached the door, he looked up: 
“‘Xunwei Zhai,’ Junior Brother, your place is quite nice! We must meet more often in the future!” 

“…” Thanks for the invite! But no gatherings! 

Once they saw Xuankong vanish into the distance, the five disciples exchanged glances. 

Then, without a word, they began to laugh in unison! 
“Let’s go, let’s return to eat!” 

The formerly empty banquet table had been cleared, revealing the dishes they had secretly saved! 
“Ha ha ha, thankfully Yuer was smart, sacrificing one spirit pig trotter to secure a full table of dishes.” 

Lan Ci timidly asked, “Master, is this really good?” What about unity in the sect?! 

Qingyang chuckled softly, stroking his beard: 
“Don’t worry, my little disciple! We’ve all been through this together. It’s not a big deal! Besides, you’ve worked hard enough to prepare these dishes; we might as well enjoy them ourselves without outsiders!” 

They couldn’t let others form a habit of mooching from them; Wanzhi Mountain wasn’t a charity! 

Just as those words left his mouth, a familiar voice echoed once more! 
“Oh? Outsiders are left out? Then what about this Lord?” 

Qingyang nearly let the spirit pig trotter slip from his chopsticks, thankfully he caught it quickly with his bowl! 

Lan Ci couldn’t help but roll her eyes: You don’t consider yourself an outsider either! 

Setting down her bowl and chopsticks, everyone rose to greet him! 

Lan Ci glanced at her little junior brother: "Oh no, we can't eat in peace!" 

Lin Yu chimed in, “Tell me about it! My huge pig trotter, wait for me (╥╯^╰╥)!” 

“I wasn’t aware of the Celestial Lord's arrival. I apologize for not welcoming you from afar.” 

“It’s no trouble. Am I interrupting your meal?” 

Lan Ci thought: Ha! You might have timed your arrival! I belong to my Master now! Master, just like how you just challenged the Head, challenge him too! 

Seeing the eager eyes of my disciples! Go for it! Well done, and who knows, maybe I’ll get another spirit pig trotter! 

“No, no! You've come at a perfect time! If you don’t mind, how about having a meal with us?” 

Master, what nonsense are you saying? Didn’t we say we’re family, no outsiders allowed?! 

Your pig trotter is gone! None left for tomorrow either! 

The South Hua Celestial Lord looked at the frozen figure before him and secretly chuckled: “That’s fine! I won’t disturb you!” 

At this point, Qingyang was oblivious to his disciples’ thoughts, fully focused on his idol, the Celestial Lord: 
“Yuer, quickly set another pair of chopsticks for the Celestial Lord!” 

“Understood!” 

Little junior brother, could you tone down your excitement at dining with your idol? 

Didn’t you just say the Celestial Lord stole your food? Now that vegetables are abundant, you don’t mind, huh?! 

I’m really foolish! I thought only the senior brothers lacked principles when facing their idols; I never realized my Master did too! 

Though he’s protective of food, his idol? Protecting food is not a priority! 

He’d eagerly serve his idol, almost putting the dishes in front of him! 

Lan Ci felt like she couldn’t bear to watch! 

Wen Zhi took the gloomy little junior sister’s hand: “Come, junior sister, let’s just go have our meal!” 

“…” 

Forget it! I can’t eat anymore! I’m already stuffed!
