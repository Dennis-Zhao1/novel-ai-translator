**Sugarcane Suspension Bridge**

Glenna held her sword, which transformed into a sea of blades forming an array of thousands of swords. Clearly, this was a technique from Xuanyuan Hao, and she had already mastered it!

Guided by the lush light, the thousand swords unleashed their power, severing all the vines in their path and heading straight for the central vine ball. 

Stimulated, the vine ball suddenly burst open, releasing green light that radiated outward, illuminating the previously dark cave. The light, although green, was a welcome sight. If it weren't for the vines attacking them, the scene would have been quite beautiful.

Wendy and Glenna, sword in hand and back to back, were surrounded by whirling plum blossoms. The strength of the vines attacking them wasn't strong; it seemed they were simply trying to drive them away, perhaps influenced by the natural energy in the air.

Deep within the vines, a ribbon-like green spirit power swirled around the vine ball. Was it there to protect the vine ball, or was it… watching?

“Junior Sister, these vines don't seem to want to attack us. Should we check on the vine ball?” Wendy suggested as she produced a small boat from her possession. Glenna quietly put aside her thoughts of using the sugarcane bridge and boarded the boat with Wendy.

“Alright.”

Fortunately, visibility was decent, and the vines weren't attacking them aggressively, although it was slightly taxing for Wendy, who needed her spirit power to navigate the boat. Glenna was more skilled in direct combat.

“Junior Sister, once we reach near the vine ball, you must quickly strike to rescue Lord Nanhua. I won’t be able to hold out for long, and if one strike fails, we shouldn't linger! Break the retreat talisman immediately, safety is paramount.”

“Don’t worry, Senior Sister.”

As they approached the vine ball, the creeping vines followed behind, but they felt fearless. Glenna eyed the timing carefully: 

“Junior Sister, now! Go!”

“Attack!”

With the vine ball about to be sliced open by the thousand swords, it didn’t react initially. Glenna infused her sword with natural energy, and the figures inside the vine ball started to emerge.

“Junior Sister, it’s Lord Nanhua!” Wendy exclaimed, controlling her magic and feeling elated. 

Whether it was really Lord Nanhua or not, Glenna didn’t know! But there was definitely someone trapped in the vines—no, a fairy ensnared by the vines.

Just as the vine ball was close to being cut through, a rush of green energy suddenly surged toward Glenna.

“**Glenna, watch out!**”

She raised her sword in defense, but was still thrust into the vines. 

“Junior Sister!”

Wendy felt anxious as she navigated the boat and controlled her spirit power. 

“I’m fine, Senior Sister! Don’t get distracted.”

A giant white beast soared toward her, and Wendy finally relaxed. It turned out Si Si had activated its true form ability, transforming from the size of a small cat to one resembling a horse, allowing Glenna to ride on it.

Si Si carried her towards the boat, where Glenna scanned the surroundings cautiously. 

“Senior Sister, where is that thing that attacked me? Be careful!”

“Got it. You be careful too!”

Despite being on alert for a long time, there was still no sign of danger around.

“This isn’t going to work. We can’t just wait here!”

“Since we know Lord Nanhua is inside, Junior Sister, why don’t we try burning it?” Wendy suggested as she pulled out a candlestick-shaped treasure lamp, sending a scorching fireball toward the vine ball.

However, it didn’t seem to have any effect! Wendy frowned, deeply concerned, as this was her most prized possession. 

“These vines are incredibly tough; they even fear no fire.”

“Exactly. Master and the others specifically sought out natural energy and must have tried other methods too. The sword didn't seem to hurt the vines much before; if I hadn’t infused it with natural energy, we probably couldn’t even open the vine ball. Senior Sister, let me give it a try!”

She infused even more natural energy into the sword. 

Perhaps sensing the danger, the vines from all directions disregarded Wendy's defense and lashed out at them directly. 

“Wendy, we need to retreat to the entrance!” 

“Alright!”

But this time, it seemed like they had truly angered the vines; the attack was extraordinarily fierce, and the boat had already taken several hits. 

Seeing Wendy spit out blood, the boat shook violently. 

“Senior Sister!” 

Glenna sheathed her sword; it wasn’t proving effective against the vines. 

“**Glenna, I can’t hold my beast form much longer. We need to find a place to land!**” 

“Understood, Si Si, you go back to spirit beast space for now.” 

As the boat started to teeter dangerously, Glenna hurried to it and supported Wendy! Using her most practiced technique, she erected a sugarcane wall to catch the boat horizontally. 

Simultaneously, she created a protective barrier around it! 

Though the attacks from the vines were strong, the defense of the sugarcane was even stronger!

“Senior Sister, we’re safe now. Let’s take a moment to rest!” 

“Mm!” 

Wendy saw the vines couldn’t break through Glenna’s defenses and quickly sat down to take a recovery pill to restore her spirit power. 

Glenna watched as Wendy meditated, not wanting to disturb her. 

When Wendy finally opened her eyes and looked around at the “suspension bridge” made of sugarcane intertwined with vines, she couldn’t help but admire her junior sister's talent. 

“Senior Sister, you’re awake? Are you okay?” 

“I’m fine.” Looking at the plants still clawing at the air nearby, she murmured, “These vines are mysterious; they seem impervious to all types of attacks.”

“Indeed, it’s no wonder the Master insisted we come here. But it seems we can’t see Master or the senior brothers; I wonder where they are and if they’re in danger?”

“I have a special way of communicating with my brother; they should be alright.”

Yet, gazing at the vine ball within reach, she sighed, “Though… we might not be able to rescue Lord Nanhua…”

She initially thought it was her duty as a senior sister to look after her junior; she didn’t expect to rely on her junior sister to save her in the end. Not to mention rescuing her idol, Lord Nanhua!

“It’s alright, Senior Sister, I have a plan!” 

Seeing her junior sister’s confident demeanor, Wendy couldn't help but ask, “What’s the plan?”

“I’ll try directly building a bridge over! There are plenty of vines that can serve as support, so it'll spare my energy!” 

“……Alright! If it doesn’t work, we’ll smash the retreat talisman and leave together!” 

“Don’t worry, Senior Sister, I’ll know my limits.” 

Just building a bridge was a quick task. The vines trapped by the sugarcane couldn’t move anymore, actually forming a stable suspension bridge. 

Compared to the unstable sensation of the boat, being on the bridge felt more grounded. 

Even though the vines were swirling outside, the bridge naturally blocked the attacks, allowing them to advance.

Once the sugarcane bridge connected to the vine ball, Glenna halted her movements! 

“Si Si, you go rest in spirit beast space.” 

“No way, Glenna! I have to protect you!” Si Si declared fiercely, unwilling to let a tragedy repeat itself. 

“It's okay; we’ll just give it a try. Since our attributes seem similar, we might be able to take on these vines. And if it really doesn’t work, we can just use the retreat talisman to escape.” 

She showed Si Si the retreat talisman that she had tightly grasped in her hand. 

“Just promise me you won’t get hurt.” 

“Worry not, I’ll be fine.” 

“Alright then! Just be careful!” 

“Okay, hurry inside! Be a good boy!” 

“Senior Sister, let’s go! We’ll head straight for the vine ball. If anything happens, we’ll break the retreat talisman immediately!” 

“Okay!”

In the shimmering green light of the vine world, the purple sugarcane bridge led directly to the vine ball. A duo of pink and purple progressed along it, appearing almost ethereal. 

From afar, it was indeed a beautiful sight, filled with joy and wonder.
