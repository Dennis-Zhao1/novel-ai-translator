**Sugarcane Community**

" Dad, Uncle Hua."

Looking at the slender, cool man with glasses in front of her, she could still catch a whiff of traditional Chinese medicine lingering in the air, which must mean he was Dr. Hua, the renowned traditional medicine doctor.

"Lanlan, this is Dr. Xiuwen Hua, our town's famous traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and a good friend of your uncle."

"Hello, Dr. Hua."

Noticing the slightly immature girl before him and the row of container houses just seen earlier, Dr. Hua felt a hint of curiosity.

"Miss Gan, I'm sorry for intruding."

"No need to be so polite, Dr. Hua. Please come in for some tea."

"Then I shall gladly accept."

Once inside the bright and tidy house, Dr. Hua paused for just a moment but didn't say anything.

"I'm sorry, I don't have any special tea at home. You and Uncle Guan will have to make do."

"This tea tastes just like the one from the Guan family."

Dr. Hua was not the serious type and even joked from time to time.

"Hahaha, it looks like it's tea I bought from your house."

Feeling embarrassed, Gan Lanlan smiled, "I really didn’t have any money back then, and Uncle Guan was willing to sell some to me."

"Hahaha, I have a batch of good tea with me. I’ll send you some later."

"Thank you, Dr. Hua."

Uncle Guan looked on, watching the two chatter about tea, becoming increasingly anxious.

"Ah, old Hua, you’re just too indecisive. Lanlan, your uncle isn’t one to mince words. You may not have noticed, but the town is in chaos right now. Many people are moving to other cities; it is said that some of the larger cities are quite safe, unlike our town. Sigh!"

He sighed heavily here, "We old and sick folks have nowhere to go. I am shamelessly bringing my old friend over because I see your houses here are safe. If you trust your uncle, I’d like to buy or rent some houses from you. We won’t be ambiguous about the price as long as we can afford it."

Worried that Gan Lanlan wouldn't believe him, he added, "I don’t have money, but the Hua family does. Though money may not be worth much right now, Dr. Hua's medical skills are trustworthy. Of course, if you want anything else, just let us know. Anything we can do, you can ask. I promise, I’m not lying…"

"Well, I'm renting…"

Uncle Guan seemed to get anxious at this, "Don't worry, uncle won’t take advantage of you…"

Taking a moment to process, "Did I hear that right? Are you really renting?"

"Uncle Guan, the house is mine. You saw it too; Guan Xin has already built two new houses. How many rooms do you need? If it’s not enough, we’ll see if we can build a few more today."

"How many can you build?" Dr. Hua quickly asked, though he seemed a bit shy, "I have a few friends…"

Seeing the two anxious faces in front of her, Gan Lanlan understood their urgency, but…

"There can easily be a few hundred more built. We just need more hands; both Xiao Guan and I alone definitely won't do."

Dr. Hua and Uncle Guan exchanged glances, their expressions brightening with excitement.

"Lanlan, what about the rent?"

Before Gan Lanlan could respond, Uncle Guan sternly advised her, "Lanlan, helping others is good, but it can’t go too far. Remember that too much is as bad as not enough. If you're going to rent out, you absolutely must collect rent. Uncle didn’t bring anything yesterday; you can count on me to settle this later."

Gan Lanlan smiled and said, "Uncle Guan, I was actually going to bring that up myself. You don’t have to worry about the rent; I have things arranged. Also, I would like to ask you and Guan Xin to help me out. Think of it as me hiring you; after all, I need 'workers', right? The rent can be waived."

"Lanlan…"

"Uncle Guan, don’t worry. Working for me won’t be easy. You and Guan Xin might even end up complaining about how I don’t pay you at all."

Dr. Hua could see that this girl had her own ideas.

He patted Uncle Guan on the shoulder, and Uncle Guan glanced at him, swallowing whatever else he was going to say.

To prevent the two older men from interjecting more, Gan Lanlan quickly changed the subject.

"Uncle Guan, Dr. Hua, you both likely know better than I do about the current situation outside, so let's hurry and move here. If any friends need to come over, feel free to invite them too. Uncle Guan and Guan Xin, I’d appreciate it if you could help me maintain some order."

"I know, we’re the security for this little community," Guan Xin chimed in, struggling to get a word in.

"…." Well, saying it that way isn't exactly incorrect.

"Though this may not be a large base, at least it can guarantee safety."

Pointing at a newly built blue house in front of the main house, the top half showcased an LCD screen, while the bottom was made up of various models of squares.

"As for rent, you might want to take a look at this blue energy house of mine. Would you like to give it a try?"

Thinking she might be the only one who needed to pay rent, Dr. Hua proactively stepped forward, first pulling out his wallet and placing it in a small drawer. The screen then displayed:

【Welcome, resident of Sugarcane Community Room 3. Using the smart payment system. Detected item: One wallet, worth 0 energy points.】

The three pairs of eyes suddenly turned towards Gan Lanlan, surprised yet amused by the name Sugarcane Community.

"This... I’ve got my bank card in there, so it’s worthless? I guess that makes me a total pauper!"

"Uh, the specifics depend on the system’s assessment~"

【According to system assessment, these are worthless. It suggests putting your hand into the energy slot for a re-evaluation.】

With a mindset of "why not try," Dr. Hua reached his hand into the energy slot.

【Welcome, resident of Sugarcane Community Room 3. Using the smart payment system. You possess medical abilities, valued at 1000 energy points. The monthly rent is 10 points per room. Would you like to move in? Yes/No.】

"Energy points?"

【Yes, energy points are the initial value assigned by the system based on residents’ abilities. All transactions within the community require energy points, which are crucial for maintaining community development. If a resident has insufficient energy points, they can gain more by completing tasks released by the community.】

"Whoa? This system is quite intelligent! So, the common currency here is energy points; that’s pretty interesting! I’m looking forward to living in Sugarcane Community now; it all sounds… sweet."

Though, there’s no need to be that excited. And that name, oh my, how embarrassing!

With Dr. Hua selecting "Yes," the window scanned his details.

It displayed that he could move in immediately, along with the option to bring one adult and n children, as long as they could fit in the room; the system was quite considerate of the little ones.

Moreover, anyone who broke the rules would be blacklisted and never allowed to step foot into Sugarcane Community again.

【Moving in one ability user, rewarding 1000 energy points. Current total energy: 11048 points.】

Gan Lanlan realized the system was quite clever!

Dr. Hua and the others didn’t comment on the strange occurrences; some secrets were best kept that way.

Afterwards, Uncle Guan and Dr. Hua moved out to get their things, leaving Guan Xin and Gan Lanlan to focus on building more houses.

With some help now, they first handled the simpler constructions before getting the roofing materials onto the adjacent structure, eliminating the need to climb ladders to cover the tops, significantly increasing efficiency.

"Hey, Lanlan, have you seen my water cup? I just had it here!"

"Uh, right? My cup was put together with yours; let’s search for it."

In such a big space, two cups somehow vanished into thin air during broad daylight.

Gan Lanlan suddenly thought of something and asked, "Xiao Guan, can I ask what you were just thinking?"

Guan Xin scratched his head, "Not much, just thinking how you guys have powers while I don’t. If I had some space ability, I could just put things away. I glanced at the water cup, and um..."

Gan Lanlan stared at the silly boy in front of her, realizing he had taken it himself but still appeared confused.

At that moment, he realized, "Could it be I really have space abilities?"

"Yes, give it a try! Just concentrate, and you should be able to see it."

"Alright! Hahaha, Lanlan, I really saw our water cups! I actually have space powers! Wow, it’s pretty big."

Gan Lanlan's heart skipped a beat; pretty big? That could…

"How big?"

"Hahaha, it’s about as big as this room! Amazing, yay yay yay!"

Well, that’s 10 square meters—sorry for any expectations I might have had for you.

However, didn’t that long rain that caused the fever awaken some hidden abilities?

Ah, whatever, it’s not important; building infrastructure is the key. Back to work!
