**Chapter Translation**

In that moment, she felt a sense of familiarity.

"Senior Brother, do you want to keep fighting? I can assure you, after one more strike, you won't be able to handle it!"

Though she knew it wasn’t quite appropriate to say, she couldn’t help it.

David Wei shook his head, spitting blood from his mouth. His gaze was somewhat dazed, his consciousness fading; the whole world seemed to be spinning…

Ultimately, he still managed to unsteadily pick himself up, his eyes unwaveringly following Clara Gan.

Even though he stood crookedly, his attitude was clear: 
He would not admit defeat!

“Come on! I won’t be able to show my face back in the village if I lose today anyway.”

“Alright!” Respect for every opponent!

In her final strike, she controlled her strength, thinking that she could simply sweep him off the stage.

As she watched David Wei charge forward with all his might, shouting encouragement to himself: “Yah~~~”

Suddenly, Clara Gan’s eyes widened—this was a look she was all too familiar with…

As she saw David Wei drawing closer, her grip changed without her realizing it.
She couldn’t hold back and struck harder!

“Boom!” David Wei was sent flying far from the stage, spitting out blood, and fainted!

“Clara Gan from the Lan Mountain Sect, victory!”

Lin Yu, excited, quickly flew to his dear junior sister's side, wanting to celebrate with her.

“Hahaha, Junior Sister, you did great! You won again! … Huh? Junior Sister, Master is over there. Where are you going?”

Seeing Clara Gan walk off expressionlessly, Lin Yu scratched his head and hurried to catch up.

In the viewing area, Master Qing Yang was somewhat curious too, signaling his eldest disciple to hurry over and take a look.

“This useless man can’t even defeat a woman! Master, let’s go!”

“Mm!”

Looking at David Wei, lying on the ground with his breathing shallow, he was simply trash picked up on the road. If not for his strength being beneficial in allowing their sect to win a few more rounds, no one would have bothered with him in the first place.

“Stop!” At the sound of a delicate command, the few disciples were taken aback.

As they turned to see Clara Gan approaching, their expressions changed. They all knew Lan Mountain Sect was the most powerful sect in the heavenly realms—not something small sects like theirs could afford to offend!

The disciples hurriedly approached her with obsequious smiles.

“Isn’t this the fairy from the Lan Mountain Sect? What can we do for you, Fairy?”

“Is he one of your sect’s disciples?” she gestured to David Wei still lying on the ground.

“Fairy, misunderstanding! Misunderstanding! He hardly counts as a disciple of our sect; just an unremarkable rustic villager we stumbled upon on the way! If he has offended the Fairy, please feel free to deal with him as you wish.”

Thinking that the trash from the recent match had offended Clara Gan made them regret it! Who would have thought that this tall guy was not only one to lose a match but also offend someone?

“Didn’t you tell him that if he made it into the top ten, he could join you?”

Terrified, they quickly nodded in agreement: 

“Fairy, rest assured! The likes of him would never make it into the immortal sect! He’s just dreaming about getting into the top ten!” They kicked David Wei, who was still unconscious.

“Fairy, it was he who offended you! It has nothing to do with us! You can deal with him however you want.”

Lin Yu, having caught up, noticed that his little junior sister was rarely this angry—after all, she usually wore a cute smile! Clearly, these people must have offended her!

“Junior Sister, what’s wrong? Did these people offend you?”

He shot them a fierce glare.

“Eh, eh, eh, Fairy, we would never dare!”

The voice of another disciple trailed behind: “What’s going on?”

“Eldest Senior Brother, you’ve come too! Where are Master and Senior Sister?”

“They went back already. What happened? Did they bully Clara?”

Coughing, they were indeed family! They all thought the same way! Did they not realize how capable their little junior sister was? How many people could bully her?

The faces of the disciples turned pale, and they quickly pleaded for mercy: 

“Fairy, we would never dare! We absolutely do not!” They pointed at the ground.

“Enough!” Clara Gan closed her eyes, composing herself.

“Since you don’t want him, I’ll take him with me!”

“Fairy, you may do as you wish… just don’t dirty your hands with such lowly trash; we’ll take him to you.”

“No need!”

Thus, they watched in shock as a bunch of purple rods formed a platform under David Wei and then soared into the sky, flying away…

“Ah, the Fairy’s powers are boundless…”

They hurriedly praised her, trying to save their lives. In front of a real immortal, even they, small sects, could only deceive themselves!

Before they could finish their sentence, the person before them had already vanished!

“Master, does this mean the immortal sect won’t kill us? What do we do now?”

“What to do? How should I know? Run!”

“Wait, Master, what about the competition, the divine beast…?”

“Compete? What divine beast? Can I beat it, or can you? The Fairy’s powers are limitless; even that strong brute, David Wei, couldn’t beat her. You think we should stick around here waiting to die? If Lan Mountain Sect seeks us out for trouble, we'd be doomed! Now, let’s go!”

And so, the pair scurried away!

Once they reached their lodgings, everyone looked at Clara Gan with concern.

“Junior Sister, what’s wrong? Do you know this person? Or did that god-forsaken sect offend you?”

As he rolled up his sleeves, ready to go beat someone up, he couldn’t help but complain: “I said we shouldn’t have let them go; I’m going to find them and settle the score for bullying my little sister!”

“Senior Brother, I’m fine! It’s just that this person is really important to me, and I need to save him.”

Hearing this, Master Qing Yang and others guessed that it might be related to her past experiences before coming to the sect.

Though these experiences counted as part of her past, they were unrelated to her life beneath the mountain.

“Alright, if you need help, just call out.”

“Mm. It’s nothing, Master knows what I’m capable of!”

Seeing her in a teasing mood, they assumed everything would be alright… hopefully!

Once everyone had left, Clara Gan checked on David Wei’s condition.

Hmm, he wouldn’t be dying anytime soon!

However, she had to investigate further; the changes she had seen on David Wei's face during the last match—it couldn’t just have been her imagination!

Raising her hand to channel her spiritual energy, she conducted an examination but found nothing unusual.

Confused, she blinked—could it really be that she had misread it?

Thinking of the situation at that time, it must have been a physical reaction from being forced into a desperate situation.

It seemed that she would need to take some drastic measures! This big guy would have to be offended.

“Uh ah…”

The three senior brothers sitting in the courtyard were startled by this tragic cry.

“What’s happening to our Junior Sister? Should we go check on her?”

Lin Yu's hand was on the door, but he hesitated to open it!

“Yu’er, don’t act rashly! Let’s wait a bit.”

Fortunately, the sounds inside quickly faded, and the three exchanged glances, returning to their previous positions.

Some made tea, some drank tea, and some continued to stare blankly at the door!

Meanwhile, inside the room, Clara Gan had also frozen!

David Wei’s face, due to the intense stimulation, had morphed into a look that Clara Gan recognized all too well!
