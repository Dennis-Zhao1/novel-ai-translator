**Caramel Milk Tea, Truly Delicious**

Lillian Gan sat down in the chair opposite the trio and asked, “What happened yesterday? Can we talk about it now?” 

Since they had made a ruckus at her door so early in the morning, she thought: let the show begin! She took out some fresh spiritual milk, white sugar made from sugarcane, a small heating stove, a small pot, and two cups from her spatial pouch.

“Little Junior Sister, that Immortal Lord was simply amazing yesterday! It was such a relief!” 

Master Qingyang couldn’t help but nod in agreement. “The cultivation world has indeed been rather low-key these past few years, but thankfully, the Immortal Lord is back!”

“Last night...” 

The followers of the Nanhua Immortal Lord began their enthusiastic reenactment!

Indeed, the Immortal Lord sat expressionless in the center position of the sofa, ignoring everything around him! In other words, he was sandwiched between Master Qingyang and Lin Yu! 

He thought, these two really are a bad match for him! It was so funny; he didn’t even dare to move now!

While Lillian listened to her Master and Senior Brother's “performance,” her hands were busy too: she placed the small pot on the stove, pouring in black tea leaves and white sugar, keeping the heat low while constantly stirring with a spatula! 

The sugar melted slowly, merging with the black tea leaves, turning into a rich brown color! The aroma of black tea mixed with the sweetness of sugar filled the entire living room. 

She poured in a small bowl of spiritual spring water, raised the heat until it boiled, and then added the spiritual milk to continue cooking!

Meanwhile, Si Si, her adorable little companion, settled down beside the pot, excited that Lillian said she would make something tasty for it! It was determined to guard its pot, behaving well without causing any chaos! 

After all, enjoying the story was as simple as perking up its ears!

However, it didn't take long before it couldn't focus anymore! Because its ears took a break, and its nose insisted on taking charge! 

So fragrant, so enticing! The smell of caramel milk tea made Si Si's head almost dip into the pot! 

Lillian chuckled and pushed it back a bit so it wouldn’t burn its head! 

Even the story-telling “comedy duo” slowed down their excited narrative! 

The Nanhua Immortal Lord, pretending to be a rock in the middle, couldn't help but sneak a few glances! His thoughts had wandered somewhere far away:  
[This milk tea smells incredible! But it’s way more complicated to make than during the apocalypse! Back then, they’d just mix black tea, milk, and sugar together without a second thought!]  
[Did she prepare this milk tea today because... she intends to recognize me?]  
[Look at this amount; it can’t be more than two cups! Besides, she's already cleaning the pot, must mean she doesn’t plan to make more, right!]  
[Two cups’ worth, one for her, so the other... Ah? This milk tea isn’t meant for me, is it??] 

At this thought, he straightened his posture proudly, glancing around a bit smugly! 

Of course, those glances were wasted on those two who were still fixated on Lillian’s hands... and the milk tea! 

The Immortal Lord thought that perhaps it would be good to let those two go from the Lianshan Sect! They were too greedy, too lackluster, and too oblivious—it was quite irritating! 

* 

Not long after, Lillian poured two cups of milk tea and placed them in a small array to cool down! After putting away her tools, she picked up a cup and took a sip, nodding in satisfaction! 

“Master, Senior Brother, are you done?” 

“Done!” 

“Very good, well done.” 

“Hehe, Little Junior Sister, what are you making? Is it a new recipe? I haven’t seen you make this before; it smells divine!” He swallowed a bit. 

Lillian calmly replied, “Caramel Milk Tea.” 

Lin Yu eagerly asked, “Does it taste good?” 

Lillian smiled and nodded affirmatively, “It’s delicious!” 

Lin Yu asked expectantly, “And the other cup, is it for whom?” Could it be for her most beloved junior brother? 

“Hmm!” 

Lin Yu was beyond excited! 

Lillian's fair and delicate little hand held the cup of milk tea and, under the gaze of eight eyes, brought it down to Si Si's feet: “Come, Si Si, it’s not hot anymore; it’s just the right temperature! Try it and see if you like it?” 

[Wao! It smells so good, Lillian! It must taste amazing!] 

Si Si stuck out its little tongue, took a sip, and then plunged its head into the bowl! 
[It’s sweet and fragrant! Delicious! I love sugarcane the most, followed by soup dumplings, and thirdly, caramel milk tea!]  
[… As long as you’re happy!] It really didn’t need to be so obsessed with sugarcane. 

The three others realized they might have overthought things! 

But they wouldn’t admit it! They suddenly saw the little beast’s position in Lillian’s heart and felt compelled to compliment it! 

“Ahem, Si Si is truly well-behaved!” Lin Yu’s voice dripped with envy. How lucky is the little beast of the Junior Sister! 

“Yes, this little beast has good fortune!” Master Qingyang sincerely praised. Truly blessed! 

“Ha, this little one is quite greedy!” No leftovers for him! He noticed how Si Si wasn’t shy about eating the little dumplings this morning either. The Nanhua Immortal Lord secretly scoffed! 

As expected, he received an angry glare from Lillian! He could only quickly amend, “... As your beloved pet, it’s a blessing for it to eat well!” 

Si Si? It didn't care about them! The world was vast, but eating was its priority! 

This was made specially for it by Lillian! It was going to lick every drop clean! 

After Si Si finished eating, Lillian had heard most of the stories, so she picked up Si Si and prepared to leave! 

“Hey? Little Junior Sister, um, what about the caramel milk tea... don’t we have any?” 

Looking back at the three of them, she smiled and replied, “I’m tired from cooking this morning! I’m heading back to rest now!” 

Nanhua Immortal Lord: “...” 

Master Qingyang: “...” 

Lin Yu dryly replied, “Ah~ right, right! Little Junior Sister, be sure to have a good rest!” 

Ha! Let them watch and not drink! 

She admitted it—she was doing it on purpose! 

She was in a bit of a bad mood today, and these three older gentlemen weren’t as thoughtful as Senior Brother! Making a ruckus so early, so why not continue rattling? 

“By the way, Senior Brother.”  

Lin Yu perked up again, seeing there were three people present, and Lillian only called him! 

“I’m here!” 

“About last night, you should have a recording stone of it, right?” 

Senior Brother had mentioned before that important events in the Immortal Realm are recorded with such stones, and since the little brother spoke so vividly, he must have seen it in person!  

However, given little brother’s cultivation realm, it was impossible for him to be on site last night; there was only one possibility: he must have watched the recording of last night's events!  

Indeed, Lin Yu pulled out a rather plain stone from his belongings: “I have it!”  

“Give it to me!”  

Receiving the recording stone, she turned and walked away, leaving behind three people staring at each other, then each sat upright, chest out, and resumed their internal competition! 

If Lillian were there, she would probably ask: “Are you all playing ‘One, Two, Three, Wooden Man’?”  

The living room felt like it had been paused! Until a gust of wind ushered in a leaf, breaking the silence!  

Nanhua Immortal Lord relaxed his shoulders, “This lord has other matters; I’ll take my leave first.” 

Nanhua Immortal Lord transformed into starlight and vanished without a trace!  

Master Qingyang moved his sore legs: “The Sect Leader needs to speak with me; I’ll be off then.” 

Master Qingyang, gone in a flash! You could barely see a shadow!  

Lin Yu turned his neck, it was so stiff; this was truly hard for him! He only dared to pace out of the living room, “I think I should find Haozi!”  

He only dared to take out his sword once outside the courtyard; he didn’t dare to act recklessly in the living room, fearing he might be beaten up! 

“Let’s go!” He took off!  

Finally, the living room returned to its former tranquility!
