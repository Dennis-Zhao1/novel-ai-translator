**The Praise Group Leader is Online**

After dinner, a few of them moved to the courtyard. 

Regarding the restaurant "Flavor Pavilion," Kayla expressed that the cleaning magic was truly amazing! 

What robot vacuum, what dishwasher, those were all inferior! One technique solved all problems, leaving everything spotless and as smooth as new! 

"Fairy Lord, did the little disciples give you any trouble on the way?" 

"No." 

"That's good! That's good!!" 

Kayla noticed that she left a bit late due to packing and saw her master awkwardly chatting with Lord South China! 

The three senior brothers and sisters stood behind her master, attending to him, as they couldn't let their master feel that they were disrespectful to an esteemed guest. 

But it was really awkward! She chose to... quietly cover her eyes! 

Lord South China also seemed unwilling to continue the awkward conversation and caught a glimpse of a purple figure with his peripheral vision. 

"Real Master Qingyang..." 

"How dare I claim that title! Fairy Lord can just call me Qingyang." 

Lord South China complied, "Alright, Qingyang! The matter regarding the Demon Village has been communicated with the Heavenly Emperor through the Immortal Alliance. The Heavenly Realm will negotiate with the Wokuzhu." 

Real Master Qingyang nodded in agreement, "Of course." 

"Hey? Little Senior Brother, is there a Heavenly Emperor in the cultivation world?" 

Lin Yu, who was trying hard to be a background character, froze for a moment. Although they were unwilling to interact with their idol when they were at the foot of the mountain, it was purely because the idol's aura was too strong. Now, with their master there as a shield, they were more than willing to get closer and let Hao envy them! 

"Uh, Little Junior Sister, the Heavenly Emperor has always existed in the Immortal Realm." 

"How come I didn’t know?" 

"Isn't this common knowledge... Oh, Little Junior Sister, you might really not know! Hahaha, no worries, now you know!" 

"… I feel like I need to catch up on the history of the Immortal Realm." 

Feeling the Little Junior Sister's tone was off, "… Then, Little Senior Brother, I’ll find you some books! I guarantee they are the best in the Immortal Realm!" 

"Thank you!" 

If they weren’t communicating through sound transmission, she really would have ground her teeth! 

She had thought her sect was harmonious and loving, but unexpectedly they were so unreliable! The "common knowledge" that these second-generation immortals had known since childhood was a complete "blind spot" for her outsider! 

"No... no need!" 

"Ha..." 

Turning her head to look elsewhere, or she was afraid she couldn't help but hit someone! She kept reminding herself, that was her dear little Senior Brother! Dear! 

Sensing the hostility, Lin Yu subtly jumped. Looking around, he found nothing unusual, and thought with the idol present, who would dare act against them? It must be a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding! 

On the other side, Lord South China was still making small talk with Real Master Qingyang: 

"I'd like to arrange for the people from the Demon Village to relocate to your Wanzhi Mountain. Firstly, your Wanzhi Mountain is one of the few peaceful places in the Lanshan Sect, making it more suitable for them to settle down." 

Real Master Qingyang nodded repeatedly, "Absolutely! There is no better place for retirement in the entire Lanshan Sect." 

Looking at a few of Real Master Qingyang's disciples, he hinted, "Secondly, your disciples are more familiar with the villagers, so I trust you to take care of them." 

Real Master Qingyang stroked his beard and nodded, "You can rest assured! Among my disciples, they are undoubtedly the best people. Especially my little disciple, who's been in the sect not long, but he won first place in this Immortal Gate Competition..." 

Real Master Qingyang realized he had gone off-topic and quickly steered the conversation back: 

"In summary, they are all excellent individuals! You won't find better disciples in the entire Lanshan Sect." 

Lord South China also slightly nodded, "However, it doesn't require too many people. Xuanging will assign some cleaning disciples who will handle their daily needs; medical care and medicine will also have dedicated personnel, and your Wanzhi Mountain only needs to send someone to coordinate." 

Real Master Qingyang thought for a moment and nodded, "What you say is correct!" 

"I think it would be best if..." he said, glancing at Wen Gu and the others! 

Kayla felt that the look Lord South China had when he glanced at her was off; she intuitively sensed trouble! 

"How about letting your little disciple take charge?" 

Just as she had suspected! She knew it! 

Lord South China was still the one who would steal her thunder! The thickness of his skin was probably proportional to his age! 

Real Master Qingyang hadn't expected Lord South China to choose his little disciple and hesitated: "This... my little disciple just joined, so it may be difficult for him to take on such a big responsibility." 

"It's decided then." 

As he spoke, the chair he had been sitting on transformed into a couch; Lord South China reclined backward, covered his legs with a pure white blanket, and smiled politely as he inquired: 

"I hadn't discovered such a good place before. I would also like to enjoy my old age here. I believe you wouldn’t mind, right?" 

Wen Gu: "..." 

Wen Zhi: "..." 

Lin Yu: "..." 

Kayla: "..." 

Real Master Qingyang awkwardly smiled: "… Of course not! Not at all!" 

Given how prepared you are, if we say we mind, would you even leave? 

In his haste, wanting to ensure he had spoken with enough sincerity to not upset their idol, he quickly added: "If you need anything, feel free to tell my disciples!" 

This was obvious flattery, but unexpectedly, Lord South China seemed to ponder for a moment: 

"I tasted a sweet wine at the Flavor Pavilion today; it was rich, smooth, and fragrant. I had never tasted anything like it before!" 

Real Master Qingyang instantly understood! Another drinker! 

He heard Lord South China praising: 

"I have had quite a bit of wine; this one is the most to my taste. Truly, you are a rare talent born from this land!" 

Upon hearing the praise, Real Master Qingyang suddenly felt like he had drunk several barrels of sugarcane wine! 

He took out a wine jar along with two crystal cups, filled them for himself and Lord South China, then couldn’t help but boast: 

"To be honest, this wine was made by my little disciple using sugarcane, and it's definitely unique in the Immortal Realm. I don't have much left; today, my senior brother at the sect took a barrel… blah blah…" 

As Lord South China sipped on the sugarcane wine: "It's indeed quite good! Not bad at all when it comes to food and drink!" 

"Of course! My eldest disciple is also well-rounded, blah blah…" 

"A rare talent indeed." 

"My junior sister Zhi Zhi is mild-mannered; her plum blossom pastries are known throughout the Immortal Gate… blah blah..." 

"Mm." 

"My Yu'er might be a bit reckless, but he’s warm-hearted… blah blah..." 

"Mm." 

Watching her master, who had turned into a praise group leader, Kayla wondered if he didn’t realize that Lord South China was just humoring him! 

So, this was what her master was like! Respect! Respect! 

"My little disciple has exceptional cultivation talent, is proficient in cooking and brewing, and most commendably has a great disposition." 

Lord South China took a small sip of the sugarcane wine: "Mm, indeed, no one can surpass him in this aspect." 

"Right? Her culinary skills…" 

Seeing the two engaged in jovial conversation about food and drinks, Wen Gu signaled for the disciples to leave! 

Upon returning to the Flavor Pavilion, everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief. 

"Big Brother, Father and Mother heard I was back and want me to come home for a visit!" 

"Senior Brother, I'm going to find Hao!" He wanted to boast—to share his grand adventure with the idol! 

"Alright, go ahead!" 

So, when the four returned, only two entered the living room! 

In addition to the kitchen and dining area, the Flavor Pavilion had a living room transformed according to Kayla’s preferences. 

The sofas were made of cotton, making them extremely comfortable to sit or lie on. In the beginning, Real Master Qingyang had complained that they were too soft and hard to get used to... 

But later on, he found it "too fragrant"! 

This became the favorite place for the master and disciples to discuss cultivation or even strategize their meals: what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! 

Wen Gu set up the tea set and calmly brewed a pot of tea, which was part of his daily routine. 

"Big Brother, what’s the situation with the Heavenly Emperor in the cultivation world? How is the power structure divided in the Immortal Realm?" 

Wen Gu paused while pouring tea, pondering that these matters they took for granted could be unknown to the Little Junior Sister. 

Especially on this trip down the mountain, it was evident that she lacked knowledge of many common concepts. 

He realized his oversight; he had treated Little Junior Sister like Yu'er, teaching her only techniques while neglecting other aspects. 

Looking at his Little Junior Sister's eager eyes... 

He couldn’t help but take on the role of a storyteller today!
