**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Encounter**

“Master, it’s been so long. They shouldn’t be in any danger, right? I’ve tried so many times and still got ejected! What should I do? My little junior sister is probably scared the first time she’s in this situation. Why aren’t the senior sisters smashing the return talismans already? Ah, I’m dying of anxiety!”

After the third disciple’s incessant rambling, Master Qingyang felt helpless.

“Yu'er, please calm down!”

“But…”

“Don’t speak! There’s movement!”

As a master of natural forces, Qingyang was far more sensitive to the surroundings than his two younger disciples. Sensing the agitation in the nearby plants, he furrowed his brows.

“Not good; Master, my sister is injured!”

Knowing their blood bond, Wen Gu became anxious as well.

“Huh? Master, what should we do? Have the senior sisters and little junior sister encountered danger?”

Master Qingyang was at a loss for what to do. He turned to Xuanqing and the others: “I ask my senior brothers for assistance in guarding while I go in to take a look!”

“Master, I will accompany you.”

“I’ll go too!”

“No, your cultivation is insufficient. I will ensure their safety and bring them back!”

With that, he disregarded their protests. He had to try every means possible, intending to use natural forces to create a formation to see if he could get in. Setting up the array would take time, and they couldn’t afford any delays!

“We’ve arrived!”

“Are you sure he is the South Hua Immortal Lord?”

“Of course! The South Hua Immortal Lord is a model for our generation; I’ve collected many of his portraits! Although I only saw him for a moment just now, I can say for certain that is the South Hua Immortal Lord.”

“Oh!”

Now she understood; it was standard practice for fans.

Looking at the vine ball before them, it was fortified with layers upon layers, more troublesome than ordinary vines!

“What should we do now? These vines are impervious to blades and fire.”

But having come this far, she was reluctant to give up.

“Senior sister, let me give it a try!”

Thinking about her little junior sister's extraordinary powers and with the return talisman as backup, Wen Zhi didn’t refuse.

“Junior sister, you must be careful.”

“Don’t worry, senior sister!”

Watching Gan Lanlan easily pry open a gap in the vine ball, Wen Zhi was left speechless!

Having seen the world, they couldn’t underestimate their little junior sister; there was no reason to be surprised!

In a moment of confusion, she could make out a seated figure within, within arm's reach.

“Excuse me, is this the South Hua Immortal Lord?”

Unfortunately, the figure remained motionless. Gan Lanlan, unwilling to give up, called out again: “South Hua Immortal Lord? South Hua Immortal Lord?!”

But there was no response. Given the commotion earlier, it wasn’t surprising that he didn’t budge even an inch.

She didn’t know if he was in deep meditation or something else!

Just as the two were about to step closer, a beam of green light shot toward them. Luckily, the protective wall of sugar cane held strong; they were unharmed.

“What was that?”

“It feels like a surge of spiritual energy, and it seems unwilling to let us pass. Be careful, junior sister!”

Gan Lanlan nodded. Confronting unseen forces was still beyond her current abilities; she was better at dealing with tangible threats.

The two remained on high alert for quite some time, but nothing emerged.

They found themselves in a predicament!

However, remaining stagnant wasn’t a solution. Gan Lanlan decided to take a risk: “Senior sister, don’t move. I’m going in!”

Without waiting for Wen Zhi to react, she stepped forward, and sure enough, that green light reappeared.

A cane swung out, striking the light, but the surrounding vines seemed to receive some command, rapidly constricting!

Now and then, some vines broke through the gaps in the sugar cane, attacking their bridge.

Forced to envelop the entire vine bridge and the vine ball with sugar cane, as long as there was sugar cane, this area belonged to her.

Seeing Gan Lanlan grasp the South Hua Immortal Lord’s shoulder, intending to lift him, Wen Zhi was too late to stop her; she could only open her mouth incredulously...

Unfortunately, Gan Lanlan’s hopeful plans were thwarted; she couldn’t budge him at all!

The mysterious force outside threatened them, while the person inside remained as immovable as a rock!

The vines grew increasingly agitated, even those further away were crushed, releasing sugar cane juice!

“Hey ha!” She was using every ounce of her strength; her clothes were tugged upwards, but he did not budge!

“Um, junior sister, what… are you doing?”

“Senior sister, hurry and help pull him out!”

“Uh, junior sister, it’s enough to awaken the South Hua Immortal Lord; there’s no need to… go so far!”

“I’m calling out, but he’s not responding! Maybe he can’t hear me; let’s pull him out first.”

What she didn’t see was that, at this moment, the figure with its back to her frowned slightly and slowly opened its eyes!

With a sidelong glance at the tiny hand gripping his clothes tightly on his right shoulder, his mood soured… and he closed his eyes again!

Nowadays, the young disciples were far too reckless! The South Hua Immortal Lord couldn’t help but think.

“...Junior sister, this isn’t how you should awaken him! Let me handle this!”

He took out his disciple token, infused it with spiritual energy, calling out with it!

“Crackle, crackle, crack, crackle…”

“Oh no, it seems that force is breaking in! Senior sister, I’ll stand guard; you wake him quickly!”

With that, he released the deformed clothing and rushed to reinforce the sugar cane wall.

The vines darted toward them like countless venomous snakes, the sugar cane wall could only hold for a while!

But it couldn’t match the speed of that green light!

In a flash, it zipped past them, and new vines sprang up, entwining Gan Lanlan tightly!

As the sugar cane and vines twined together, purple and green intertwined, a strip of green spiritual energy stealthily moved behind Gan Lanlan, preparing to launch a sneak attack!

“Vine Goddess, do not harm anyone!”

A mysterious voice echoed, mid-ages, while Gan Lanlan resisted the attacks of the vines, she stole a glance from the corner of her eye to see who this melodious voice belonged to! 

Unfortunately, the figure swept past, and she couldn’t catch a glimpse!

Just then, a voice filled with joy rang out!

“South Hua Immortal Lord!”

It appeared that her senior sister had succeeded! She could finally breathe a sigh of relief!

Gan Lanlan felt a tall figure appear behind her and tightened her grip on the sugar cane stick!

Although everyone said the South Hua Immortal Lord was a gentleman, they weren’t familiar with him!

Having been absent for hundreds of years, who knew if he was still a good person? If he was untrustworthy, they would both be finished.

So, it was better to be cautious!

“Vine Goddess, you need to leave!”

Unexpectedly, this statement stirred up a hornet's nest; the vines went wild, pulling even harder!

Gan Lanlan exerted all her strength to prevent the vines from snatching away her beloved sugar cane stick!

At the same time, a previously quiet space suddenly erupted with a piercing female voice:

“No, South Hua! I won’t leave! We will be together forever! Together forever!!!”

The haunting melody reverberated around them, never-ending! It was maddening!

“Too noisy!” Gan Lanlan muttered softly.

“Then let’s silence her!”

The voice seemed to echo right next to her, almost as if it was speaking directly to her…

Oh! It really was whispering in her ear!

A large hand reached from behind Gan Lanlan, grabbing her small hand!

Feeling the warmth on the back of her hand, she confirmed it was no mirage!

In her heart, Gan Lanlan screamed like a gopher: 
“Why are you holding my hand!!! Ahhhh!!!”
