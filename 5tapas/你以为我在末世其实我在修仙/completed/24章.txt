**One Can't Be Left Behind**

In the sugarcane base, which stands as the most stable outpost in this post-apocalyptic era, every household is equipped with sturdy two-story residences. Though they are container homes, compared to high-rise buildings, everyone knows that container homes are far safer.

Being the largest grain export base in China, its external infrastructure and military defenses are unmatched by other bases.

While some suggested expanding the sugarcane base, Lanlan Gan stated that the current scale was already the limit of what she could manage. Thus, she began to develop and stimulate the construction of nearby bases. Under the research conducted by Chinese scientists, multiple specialized bases were created:

There are bases for vegetable supply, grain supply, fruit supply, cotton supply, livestock supply, solar power generation, and more, all solidifying the foundation for China's development.

As the network of bases continues to expand, it connects with more countries, gradually enabling foreign trade. Even though mutated zombies have emerged, exhibiting stronger powers, they still cannot reproduce naturally. 

Humanity has begun to adapt to the post-apocalyptic life, and the birth rate is steadily increasing. Relatively speaking, the world is now more suitable for human survival.

Everything is moving in a positive direction!

This morning, while taking her usual stroll, Lanlan Gan walked through the familiar neighborhood, greeting faces she recognized. Children occasionally dashed past her.

"Hey, Lazy Lanlan, up already?" a local aunt managing food supplies called out.

"Lazy Lanlan, up already?" asked Dr. Hua, who was practicing Tai Chi as she passed by.

"Lazy Lanlan Sister, come eat at my house today! My mom cooks so well!" a young child invited her enthusiastically.

......

Such a good reputation, tarnished by an empty mouth!

He looked like a refined young man, but alas, he didn't think before speaking, and his careless words had spread everywhere. What a lamentable past!

To attend a meeting with the leaders, with the help of her assistant Si Si, she had stored some energy for the base, ensuring its safety while she was away. Perhaps repurposing the energy was too taxing, and the next day she couldn't get out of bed, coinciding with an unfortunate encounter with the escort team led by Team Hua.

Moreover, she wasn't fond of bustling social gatherings; many tasks were left to her companions like David Wang and Uncle Guan. In short, she was a real homebody!

As a result, everyone concluded that their base leader was just a lazy person.

And just like that, after a short outing, the residents gave her a new nickname!

Ah, but seeing the smiles on their faces, she never objected; after all, "lazy" and "lan" are only phonetically different...

Besides, if she could sit, why stand? And if she could lie down, why bother to sit?

Two tears were swept away by the wind, leaving everyone joyful.

In the end, it was all her doing!

Team Hua observed Lanlan Gan, who seemed unwilling to engage but was compelled to interact. He recalled how she always smiled and greeted the elderly and children at the base. 

She didn’t embody the typical demeanor of a base commander, yet her genuine warmth won the affection of the residents. Although she often seemed withdrawn and carefree, she would lead everyone to resist threats during crises.

Reflecting on her typical behavior during meetings with higher-ups, Hua couldn’t help but smile. 

At that meeting, when officials demanded resources be restricted for ordinary people, she showed no fear:

"The sugarcane base was built by us together. Whether it's non-ability users, elderly, children, or pets, if you deem them unimportant, that’s your perspective. To me, they are all crucial—none can be left behind!"

“We're just negotiating here. Besides, the ability users have it tough, always fighting on the front lines…”

“I don’t deny the hardships of the ability users, but ordinary people don’t have it easy either. At our base, everyone is compensated according to their labor. Even if you came to our base, it would be the same!”

Seeing the other side still complaining, she finally lost her temper.

“This base was built by me, and I cultivate the grain. I can give it to whom I choose. I’m here to discuss collaboration today, and our internal distribution is not for others to concern themselves with. As for the resource concerns you raised, I’ve already stated that the road network has been established, and resource distribution is not an issue! Instead of arguing here, you should spend more time fighting zombies and transporting supplies.”

After saying this, she left the meeting room without caring about the reactions of those present.

No one expected that the seemingly approachable neighbor-girl type leader would erupt like this suddenly.

Several who were plotting to insert their personnel into the sugarcane base and began the conversation about resource distribution found themselves leaving the meeting in frustration, their plots thwarted and plans laid to waste.

Lanlan Gan declared she had already embraced the strongest ally; she wasn't afraid of anyone!

After finally returning to the sugarcane base, she felt deeply grateful:

It's so good to be home!

As for other matters, with David Wang handling affairs on the ground and Team Hua providing security, she simply needed to oversee the base like a power generator!

[“Lanlan, there are many discounted items in the Star Network Mall. Aren't you going to buy anything now?”]

[“Not for now. I checked, and there’s nothing I could really use. The items from the Star Network are excellent, but human creativity is also robust; we can make anything.”]

[“That's true. The basic infrastructure in the base, like electricity and water supply, is all constructed by our people.”]

Indeed, human creativity, vitality, and potential are limitless!

[“Exactly. And didn’t you say we're still just in a chaotic era, not having reached the end time yet? It’s relatively safe, right? If we call this safe, does it mean there might be even greater disasters to come?”]

After all, life for humanity is already challenging as it is.

[“Hmm, I am not sure, but the main system keeps indicating we’re only in a chaotic era, and we haven't reached the end times yet.”]

Lanlan Gan sensed this as well. Although Si Si was an intelligent system, it was relatively simple and relied heavily on the main system.

Sometimes, she wondered if relying entirely on the main system was a bad habit, both for herself and humanity.

To hone her abilities, during dangerous encounters, she always stepped up to the frontline herself.

[“So I need to hold back a bit. I currently have a lot of energy points, and the interest in the Star Bank is quite good, but I need to allocate this energy wisely.”]

[“Yeah, you’re right, Lanlan.”]

[“However, Si Si, are there really no updates? I'm feeling a bit anxious lately—is something really going to happen?”]

[“Anxious? Scanning shows that your body is fine, Lanlan! What does anxiety have to do with impending dangers?”]

[“Nothing... just hope everything will turn out well!”]

[“It will! Definitely!”]
