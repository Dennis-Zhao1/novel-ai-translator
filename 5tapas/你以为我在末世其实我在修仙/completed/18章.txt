**The First Batch of Guests**

"Lan, a convoy is approaching again. My dad has already gone to keep watch."

"Don't worry; this time it should be friendly rather than hostile! Let's have our PR officer, David Wang, greet them!"

After all, Gan Lanlan's monitor showed that the leading vehicle was flying the flag of Huaguo. Si Si mentioned that he didn't sense any malice from them; in fact, quite the opposite. According to him, they carried an aura of righteousness. It was quite mysterious.

Of course, even if they weren’t allies, we should turn them into allies! The base really needed to establish connections with the outside world. Otherwise, while being self-sufficient in our "closed-off garden" might work for now, it isn't a sustainable long-term plan.

Especially since there was basically no scientific and educational foundation to support the community’s development. There had never been any research institutions in the town to begin with, let alone institutions of higher learning. With many talented individuals flocking to larger cities, the number of professionals who could remain in the town was minimal. Dr. Hua's family was already considered the crème de la crème among the township’s talents.

"Captain, it looks like there’s a base up ahead. Uncle and Auntie might be there." Though he had said this many times before!

"This is definitely where your family used to live; I have a great sense of direction…"

The members in the back silenced the gregarious Qiangzi, gesturing for him to stop talking. Didn’t he notice the captain's increasingly grim expression?

Seeing the captain's tightly pursed lips, Qiangzi obediently closed his mouth. Since the apocalypse began, as soldiers, they had been on the frontline of disaster relief efforts.

Although they had eventually reconnected with their higher-ups, the communication disruptions meant many had lost contact with their families. The captain’s family lived in a relatively remote town, and after the unrest, he had been completely unable to get in touch with them. On top of that, the captain had been out on missions for over a year without contact.

Their team had gathered information about colleagues’ family members along the way, helping to resettle many. However… they had also inevitably buried many of their own. 

Only the captain had not been able to contact his family and had not encountered anyone from the town at all. Everyone suspected that the town might have already ceased to exist, but no one dared to mention it in front of the captain.

It was clear to everyone that the captain was treating every mission as if it were his last, desperately wishing to get closer to home.

They had passed through many places and witnessed the true "man-eating" nature of society; it had filled them with dread, as if their blood had frozen in their veins.

Especially with the recent emergence of a powerful "man-eating monster" group that had destroyed a dozen bases large and small, leaving devastation in their wake, and no survivors. Intelligence reported that this group was heading in this direction.

If they hadn’t encountered a base in chaos requiring their support, they would have been here much sooner.

Thinking of this, Qiangzi gripped his weapon tightly, hoping for good news up ahead!

As they drew closer to the base, it became clear that the captain's driving speed was reaching its limit. 

Closer, closer... Until he seemed to feel the weight of nostalgia weighing him down, the vehicle began to slow, and the vehicles behind also followed suit.

It wasn’t until they saw the large characters spelling out "Sugarcane Base" at the entrance that everyone began to exit their vehicles.

Standing at the entrance and looking at the base, which didn’t even have fortifications, they hesitated to harbor too much hope.

"This base is quite strange; it doesn’t have any defensive works, just a couple of watchtowers. Not very professional at all!" Qiangzi muttered under his breath.

"Captain, someone is coming!" 

Fat Wang, now in charge of his first diplomatic mission, stepped forward with a smile!

As both sides officially met, Hua Ziying stepped forward, 

"Hello, I'm Hua Ziying, a soldier from Huaguo. Is there someone here named Hua…"

Before he could finish his introduction, someone suddenly burst out from the base, colliding with Fat Wang and causing him to stagger.

Regaining his balance, Fat Wang looked to see who dared to interrupt him!

As he saw it was Guan Heping, he shrank back, not daring to confront him.

"Stealing my thunder, huh? Pushing me aside, really…" Of course, he dared only to whisper.

"Ziying? Is that you, Ziying?" 

"Uncle Guan?"

He enthusiastically clapped Hua Ziying, who was much taller than him, feeling both excitement and relief as he found an old friend at last!

"Hahaha, good lord, with that scruffy beard, I nearly didn't recognize you! If it weren't for your familiar voice, I doubt even your parents would recognize you."

As he spoke, he couldn’t help but reminisce, "Ah, finally, you’re back! Your parents and grandparents can relax now!"

"Uncle Guan, my parents, my grandparents… they’re all alright?" 

Seeing Ziying’s red eyes, tired and a bit scruffy from his journeys, Guan Heping felt a lump in his throat. 

"They're all well! So many years, we’ve only worried about you! Come, come, let's go home with Uncle."

"Okay!"

Watching the team follow Guan Heping towards the central area of the base, introducing them as they walked…

Fat Wang felt the breeze at the base was a bit lonely, sighing that heroes had no place to showcase their talents!

Having just been appointed, and already foreseeing his dismissal!

Since welcoming wasn't his job anymore, he hurriedly arranged logistics, making sure food and accommodations were ready to make their departing guests feel at home.

With this thought in mind, he hurried off toward the guesthouse, his rotund figure moving faster than one might expect.

Ah, who said he wasn't a "criminal" now? He had to make a good impression!

"Old Hua, Uncle Hua, Aunt Hua, Sister-in-law, come out! Look who’s back!"

"We heard you! No need to shout so loudly! Is it Lan…"

Despite their tired appearance and scruffy beards, they instantly recognized their long-lost child, their eyes misty.

Ziying looked at his parents and grandparents, who were silver-haired but still spirited, and moved closer, catching a whiff of that familiar herbal scent.

His mother and grandmother rushed over, hugging Ziying tightly, unwilling to let go.

"Ziying, you’re back! Your mother and grandmother were worried sick about you…"

"My precious grandson, you’ve lost so much weight and darkened… you must have suffered quite a bit!"

"My poor son! Why did it take so long for you to come back? Why so long…"

Dr. Hua could not help but wipe away the tears at the corners of his eyes.

"I’m sorry, Dad, Mom, Grandpa, Grandma, I came back late!" He spoke with a lump in his throat.

"Alright, as long as you’re back, that’s enough. Stop crying now; you don’t want to embarrass yourself in front of others."

"Who dares to make fun of me? My son is back, isn’t it reason enough to be happy?"

"Yes, yes… Now that our son is back, he must be hungry. Go prepare some good food!" 

"Right, right! Wait here; Mom will go make you something delicious! You head over to wash up; there’s a bathhouse nearby, and we have your clothes ready..."

"Go make the food; I’ll take care of everything else. Don’t forget, a lot of your comrades have come too!"

"Okay, okay! Sorry, I was too lost in thought. Come over and sit in the house..."

At that moment, Guan Heping also said, "We can’t all fit in the house. No need to worry; Lanlan has everything arranged. I'll lead Ziying and his comrades to the guesthouse to rest, and we'll plan for lunch at the primary dining hall. You take care of whatever you need at the dining hall."

"Sounds good; I trust Lanlan’s arrangements!"

Though it was just a shipping container home, holding onto the family picture frame and seeing many familiar things, Hua Ziying finally felt the sensation of being home. 

Dr. Hua carried a basin filled with toiletries in one hand and a bag of clean clothes in the other.

"Come on; let’s take you to the bathhouse for a wash."

Meanwhile, Qiangzi and the others were also well taken care of with clean clothes and a clean bathroom.

They could take baths, shave, and even had charging stations...

On the way, they spotted a small store with a few kids buying candy.

Thinking he might check it out to see if he could find something good later, Qiangzi couldn’t quite believe how peaceful it was here amidst the chaos of the end of the world.
