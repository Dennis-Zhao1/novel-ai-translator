**Team Building Dinner**

Braised pork, stir-fried shredded potatoes, oil-braised prawns, and tomato egg soup!  
Four dishes and one soup, perfectly balanced between meat and vegetables!  
With the addition of white rice, everything is ready!

Wen Zhi, who had been standing at the door, somehow found herself slowly moving closer to Gan Lanlan’s side, her eyes almost glued to the pot, completely oblivious to it.  
Gan Lanlan smiled; although everyone was older than her… quite a bit older, those who possess natural powers were generally purer, their emotions written all over their faces.

"Senior Sister, I seem to have made a bit too much. If you don’t mind, could you help me eat some?”  
“Isn’t that a bit inappropriate?”  
Though she said that, Wen Zhi couldn’t take her eyes off the steaming, aromatic delicacies.

Gan Lanlan took Wen Zhi’s hand and led her to the table, directly placing chopsticks in her hand.  
“Senior Sister made me so many delicious dishes this morning; you should try some of mine too! I only made some home cooking, just for you to taste.”  
She used the serving chopsticks to scoop Wen Zhi some braised pork and shredded potatoes, and unable to hold back her own hunger, Gan Lanlan finally forgot about her dear senior.

Mm, this meat is so delicious—tender and not greasy, sweet and salty just right!  
Hmm, no wonder they call it spiritual prawns; they’re huge, sweet, and delicious—the satisfaction of biting into the prawns is unparalleled!  
Ah, this potato looks so bright and vibrant, crunchy and refreshing, sour and spicy!  
Click, let me have another bite of the tomato egg soup, perfectly balanced with a sweet and sour taste, the eggs tender and smooth, refreshing and light!

Even Gan Lanlan had to admit that the spiritual food in the cultivation world was indeed exquisite!  
Compared to the cuisine in the apocalypse base? Nothing—this was incomparable!

“Senior Sister, hurry up and eat; if you don’t, it’ll get cold!”  
So, the two of them… indulged in their meal in silence!

Wen Zhi picked up a strip of shredded potato, something she had never tasted before. It looked vibrant and smelled aromatic, a different aroma from the floral scents she was used to.  
With a mindset of just trying a piece, she held her left hand underneath and slowly delivered the shredded potato to her mouth with her right hand. As she bit down, her eyes widened slightly!  
It tasted surprisingly good!

Imitating Gan Lanlan, she picked up another bite of shredded potato.  
Wow, so this is what spiritual food tastes like!  
Another piece of braised pork brought forth a whole different flavor experience.

The tomatoes usually enjoyed by the sisters turned out to create a sweet and sour broth when cooked with the spiritual eggs, incredibly refreshing to drink!  
As for the prawns, she had heard that some sea monsters looked like this, somewhat strange, and didn’t know what they’d taste like.  
But she was unsure how to handle them!

“Senior Sister, this prawn is so fresh! Just peel off the head, remove the shell from the tail, and enjoy the meat. This one is already peeled for you, Senior Sister, you can eat it.”  
“Thank you, Junior Sister!”  
Seeing her Junior Sister skillfully peel the prawns, she felt, ultimately, a bit slow.

After some thought, she formed some hand signs, infused her technique, and the prawn was perfectly separated from its shell in one go.  
Then, using her chopsticks, she dipped it in some vinegar, imitating her Junior Sister.  
“Junior Sister, is this how I eat it?”  
“…!”  
“Senior Sister is happy, just eat!”  
Was this how celestial techniques were utilized? Truly a must-have for home and travel; she had to learn this!

But now wasn’t the time to rush.  
Taking another bite of rice and enjoying the taste of the braised pork was such a delight—a meal of spiritual food in the cultivation world made this experience worthwhile!

“Junior Sister, Junior Sister, I’m back! … Huh? Senior Sister, Junior Sister, what are you two eating?”  
As he spoke, he craned his neck, sniffing around. “It smells so good!”  
“Senior Brother, I made some food and was just inviting Senior Sister to eat with me!”  
“Wow, I didn’t know Junior Sister was skilled in cooking—it smells amazing!”

Seeing Lin Yu’s eager expression, what else could she say at this point! Of course:  
“Senior Brother, I may have made too much. Why don’t we all have some together?”  
“Sure, sure!”  
And just like that, a meal meant for one turned into a feast for two, and eventually transformed into a gathering for four of the brothers and sisters!

Don’t ask; just know that the Senior Brother came back from outside with some food and drinks for his dear Junior Sister, only to stumble upon this trio currently eating.  
Such a fun occurrence… cough, not that, how could he miss out on this event that fosters camaraderie among siblings!

Fortunately, the Senior Brother didn’t come empty-handed; he brought back some dishes from the inn at the foot of the mountain, alongside a non-alcoholic fruit drink, thus laying out a complete spread.  
“Thank you, Senior Brother, for preparing the food; it’s delicious! Thank you, Senior Sister, for your meticulous care; and also, thanks to the Senior Brother who brought me up the mountain. Although I’ve only been here a short time, I’m really happy! Junior Sister would like to raise a cup of water in place of wine to toast all the Senior Brothers and Sisters.”  
“We are all family here, no need for such formality. Besides, this food cannot compare to what Junior Sister makes!”  
The Senior Brother raised his cup, signaling it was empty.  
“That’s right!” The Junior Brother finished his cup in one go.  
“The food made by Junior Sister is indeed delicious, and we, the Senior Brothers and Sisters, have benefited from you.”

The beautiful girl drinking water must cover her face with her sleeve, unlike Gan Lanlan, who, from the apocalypse, was carefree and gulpy like she was drinking water.  
“Exactly!” This fruit drink is so good; Junior Brother, refill my cup!  
“Indeed, Junior Sister can proudly stand tall in the Lan Mountain Sect with these cooking skills!”  
“Exactly!” Another toast with the fruit drink, cheers to Junior Sister.

“It’s really nothing, just some homely cooking. I owe it all to the Senior Brothers and Sisters for not minding!”  
Gan Lanlan took a small sip. The flavor of this fruit juice was indeed delightful; the fruits from her time couldn’t compare to the spiritual plants!  
“Not minding at all! This is delicious; if I could eat this every day, I wouldn’t mind moving a bed by the kitchen door!” He poured himself another cup.

“Smack!”  
“Ow! Senior Brother, why did you hit me?”  
Wen Gu retracted his folding fan and said, “This is the fruit drink I prepared for Junior Sister; you’re just having it so happily!”  
Lin Yu sulkily placed down his cup. Should he drink it or not?  
“Ah, isn’t this just too good? I almost forgot! This is the renowned drink from the Zhenxiu Pavilion, very precious! Junior Sister, drink more, drink more!”

Thinking it would be a waste, if he poured it, he had to drink it. He did not leave the cup; he swiftly downed it!  
Ah, it’s delicious!  
“Ah, by the way, Haozi and the others have no idea what sugarcane is; truly, my Junior Sister is one of a kind.”  
“I’ve already informed the Master; he doesn’t recognize this either. However, he is returning in a few days, and it’s best for him to take a look at this item. As long as it doesn’t interfere with future cultivation, it should be fine!”  
“Okay, thank you, Senior Brother!”  
After the meal, Wen Gu waved his fan, clearing the table and stove completely clean!  
Gan Lanlan was left completely shocked! At the same time, she developed a technique she wanted to learn!

“Thank you very much for the meal, Junior Sister. We can take a nap after lunch. After the nap, let Zhi Zhi help you get familiar with the place.”  
Seeming to see the envy in Gan Lanlan’s eyes, he comforted her gently:  
“As for these simple techniques, with your talent, I believe you will learn them quickly.”  
“Okay.”  
Indeed, the sun was high in the sky!  
It was time for a nap!
