**First Battle, Victorious**

No matter where you are, the night market is always the liveliest place.

Lantern riddle guessing, acrobatics, vendors selling noodles and masks, as well as stalls offering various spiritual foods, items, and artifacts.

You could say it has everything under the sun.

The Lan Mountain Sect's Grand Competition is indeed a rare sight in the cultivation world; after all, many of the vendors here have some connection, directly or indirectly, to the Lan Mountain Sect, whether they are from the same clan or the same village.

For example, Gan Lanlan spotted a familiar face—the big ox who had taken her to the Lan Mountain Sect.

Alongside him was Gouzi, and to her surprise, they had partnered up in business together.

She noticed someone had woven large backpacks and small bamboo baskets, with a young man in a Lan Mountain Sect robe accompanying them.

Oh, wasn’t this the kid called Er Niu!

She picked up one of their baskets to inspect it; they looked great for carrying spiritual plants or vegetables, and she casually said, "These are good. I'll take these two, please wrap them up for me!"

"Sure thing... Hey, Miss Gan!" 

"Gan Fan?" 

Wang Er Niu—no, it should be Wang Yifan now.

He quickly bowed, realizing he had just said something outrageous. "No, I meant, Senior Sister Gan! And hello to all the Senior Brothers and Sisters!"

"Haha, little junior sister, is this the kid who registered your name?" 

"Yes!" 

What a painful memory! It was this kid who mistakenly registered her name as "Gao Fan," and she had been misunderstood for quite a while because of it. 

Hmph, she was magnanimous and wouldn't hold it against a child!

"Er Niu, have you joined the Ten Thousand Sword Mountain?" 

"Yes, Senior Sister." He replied, "By the way, I’m now called Wang Yifan." Thankfully, it seemed the Senior Sister was not angry.

"Yifan, that’s nice! If you ever need anything, come find me at Wan Zhi Mountain!” She said, tossing him a small message amulet.

Though she wasn’t in this body at the time, she accepted that kindness!

"Thank you, Senior Sister Gan!" 

"These bamboo baskets are well-made, wrap them all up for me!" 

Grateful for a way to handle vegetables that were more suited for the expensive items given to her by her Senior Brothers, these were just perfect! 

Da Niu saw his younger brother being treated with such importance and quickly stepped up to help.

"Right away, Fairy! We’ll wrap these up for you!" 

Da Niu never expected that the former Miss Gan would have such good fortune.

It seemed that good deeds were rewarded, after all, Gan had indeed done many good things!

"Would you prefer gold, silver, or spirit stones?" 

Don’t ask; just know that they had plenty of money at Wan Zhi Mountain! After all, Wan Zhi Mountain's spiritual plants were different from others and fetched high prices from their sect.

What's the difference, you ask?

It’s like the contrast between ordinary vegetables and expensive orchids!

"Oh, no, no! We couldn't take your money!" 

Seeing Da Niu’s wounds, she shook her head. "You’re running a small business; don’t put it off."

Lin Yu quickly chimed in to support her. "Exactly! My little junior sister wants to buy something; we can't not pay!"

Noticing that Da Niu seemed a bit embarrassed, Gouzi quickly interjected, “Well, can the fairy give us some spirit stones? You see, we’ve settled by the Lan Mountain Sect, doing small business, so spirit stones would be easier.”

"Sure!" 

"Will you need help carrying them?” 

“No need.” 

With a flick of her sleeve, all the baskets were safely stowed away.

She had more than enough storage from her master and senior brothers! Storing a dozen baskets was nothing to her!

Gouzi thought for a moment and said, “Fairy, we heard that the bandits you burnt down before went to towns in the south.”

Gan Lanlan was momentarily stunned. Although she had already issued a task to find those bandits, she wasn't expecting these simple folks to still remember her.

"Thank you!" She gave extra spirit stones as a reward.

Watching the figures of her senior brothers and sisters drift away, Da Niu and Gouzi shared a sense of sentiment.

Fortunately, they too had found their own path. Even if they couldn’t cultivate, they could still live well by the Immortal Master Mountain!

“Little junior sister…” 

Lin Yu hadn't even spoken yet when he was lightly hit by his Senior Sister, signaling him to keep quiet.

Little junior sister’s family background was different from theirs, and sometimes, saying too much could lead to trouble.

In fact, Gan Lanlan didn't feel much attachment to the Gan family. If she had to say the most vivid memories in her mind, they were from the end times she experienced—perhaps because that period was so difficult, it felt particularly precious.

Whenever she recalled it, the images of everyone were too vivid—though she knew it might just be a dream.

Even now, surrounded by the bustling night market, she often felt somewhat out of place.

Until her junior brother forcibly stuffed a piece of food into her mouth, something said to be very popular at the night market.

“Here, little junior sister, try this! But honestly, I think nothing compares to your cooking…” 

Looking at the caring eyes of her senior brothers and sisters, she smiled.

After all, there were many people who cared for her, weren't there?

---

On the day of the competition, the five students and their master were gathered in the courtyard for breakfast.

"What? I have a match today?" 

"Lan'er, did you not know? Didn't Yu'er ask about the competition schedule?" 

Master Qing Yang said while sipping his spirit rice porridge.

Lin Yu was already holding his bowl, silently turning his head away, wolfing down his food.

"Little junior brother?" It was roughly a ground-gritting moment for him!

“Haha, well, little junior sister, I’m full now! I’ll go help you find out what you need for the competition.” 

He set down his bowl and quickly grabbed a bun, running off in a rush. He had played too hard yesterday and forgotten all about the competition.

Seeing that their little junior sister was about to explode with anger, it was fortunate that the older brother was reliable:

“Little junior sister, don’t worry. There will be someone assigned to notify you before the competition starts; you won’t miss it. Just enjoy your meal!” 

Sigh, Gan Lanlan had to reflect that it was partly her own fault.

Since arriving in the cultivation world, she had tended to observe rather than engage, and as a result, her efforts lacked seriousness.

If it were the post-apocalypse, she probably would have died long ago.

A lesson learned! 

Fortunately, finding information wasn’t too difficult. Moreover, the notifications about the competition had already been delivered, so they weren’t too anxious.

Lin Yu cautiously glanced at little junior sister and quietly shared the update: “Little junior sister, among the four of us, you are the only one competing this morning; the rest of us are scheduled later.”

“Okay, I’ll head over right away!” 

Even if she hadn’t reviewed her exam books for the language levels, it didn’t stop her from checking out the venue! After all, she had registered and needed a way in.

The first match was against the Sword Sect, whose techniques were very similar to those of the Wan Mountain Sect, differing mainly in cultivation levels as explained by her master.

Fortunately, her opponent was also a newcomer.

It seemed that the first day would involve competitions among the new disciples of each sect! Just like the Olympics, fights were divided by weight class!

The official competition began!

Below the arena, the four disciples were neatly seated to witness their little junior sister's first match. They had to be there!

Lin Yu tilted his head towards his senior sister, whispering, “Senior Sister, the match has started; why hasn’t little junior sister moved?”

Wen Zhi unconsciously tightened the handkerchief in her grasp. “Maybe little junior sister is a bit nervous since it’s her first competition?”

“Don’t worry; she’s probably just sizing up her opponent’s capabilities.” If only your handkerchief didn’t tremble so much, that would be more convincing.

“She moved!”

！！！

Master, you startled us with your sudden shout!
