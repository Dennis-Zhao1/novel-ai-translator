**Retirement Life**

Since the last gathering at the "Flavor Pavilion," the five master and disciples had developed a new shared hobby—eating!

Don’t underestimate the power of a meal; it’s a wonderful way to strengthen their bond, share information, and exchange insights!

Occasionally, they would enjoy a few drinks together, thanks to Master Qiyang or their exceptionally skilled senior brother who provided the spirits. Or they would indulge in some afternoon tea snacks, lovingly crafted by Sister Wen, which, while sweet on their own, paired perfectly with a nice cup of tea.

As for young Lin, he was practically the resident errand boy! 

The best part? He was thrilled to be part of it all—he got to taste every new dish first!

As for Gan Lianlan, since Master Qiyang had stopped venturing out, he was busy nurturing his disciples... er, I mean, teaching them well!

Every day, he would set up a low couch in a pavilion, brew a pot of spiritual tea, and arrange a few trays of treats that his disciples brought him, while guiding their studies. For instance:
“Let’s hear how the eldest disciple’s music skills have improved; has his control over spiritual plants gotten any better? The combination of sound and natural forces can unleash powers not to be underestimated!”
“The second disciple arranges flowers with such elegance that it’s pleasing to the eye! Don’t dismiss floral arrangements—creating a small world through them greatly benefits the growth of spiritual plants! If the second disciple achieves even modest success, it wouldn’t be impossible for her to create her own ‘realm’!”
“And then there’s the youngest disciple who’s using spiritual plants as a sword. The swordplay is vital, but controlling the plants requires firsthand guidance from this master, doesn’t it?”
“Look over there at the small disciple in the woods—absolutely no worries there, it’s refreshing indeed. She understands quickly and grows wildly, splendid indeed!”

Regardless of how the others felt, he certainly found joy in it all.

After all, who would prefer the outside world’s rain and wind when home is so comfortable?

Want to study new spiritual plants? No problem! Just post a task at the Baixiao Pavilion, and there’s no shortage of rare species available!

Indeed, what they had plenty of in Wanzhi Mountain were spiritual stones! After all, beneath Wanzhi Mountain lay the best spiritual vein of the entire Lanshan Sect, along with a spiritual spring!

A little digging would yield spiritual stones! And combined with the spring, which was limited but still in high demand, it’s a true treasure trove!

Of course, the spiritual plants produced by Wanzhi Mountain were priceless, sought after by many!

In short, Master Qiyang didn’t want to struggle anymore; he just wanted to enjoy retirement!

***

At Wanzhi Mountain, a typical barbecue time!

The five of them were relishing the barbecue, listening to music!

Suddenly, a paper crane, glimmering with starlight, flew from afar. Master Qiyang reached out to catch it and replied, “Got it!”

The paper crane then vanished into thin air.

Gan Lianlan was puzzled but noticed her seniors didn’t seem curious either, so she simply went back to gnawing on her chicken leg!

Until Master Qiyang sighed, “How quickly time flies; the biennial Immortal Sect Grand Tournament is upon us!”

“The Immortal Sect Grand Tournament?”

“I know about this! Every three years, the entire cultivation world holds this tournament where all the major sects gather at Lanshan Sect, making it quite lively! I’ll take you to broaden your horizons, little junior brother!”

“Oh, I see! By the way, regarding the tournament, I’ve always had a question?”

The disciples turned to their younger sister, who had always been quite diligent and serious about her studies—she had saved them a lot of trouble compared to Lin Yu!

“What’s your question? Big brother will tell you everything!”

“Well, as a new disciple, I’ve been here for quite a while now—aren’t there any assessments or exams?”

After almost half a year, it felt like every day was nothing but eating and drinking, practicing magic, and sometimes tagging along with senior brothers and sisters to enjoy the scenery.

And then... nothing else happened…

While cultivating isn’t always about fighting and killing, shouldn’t there be some form of leveling up? Their current life was quite dull, feeling eerily similar to retirement!

“Of course there is! Young sister, you passed long ago. Didn’t you know?”

“Huh? When was that? How could I know?”

“Not long ago, during the festival, when Master asked you to prepare a feast for the main peak, didn’t you receive a disciple's insignia upon your return?”

“Ah? But that was simply because the Elders wanted to celebrate! I thought it was a gift for the elders! Besides, isn’t the insignia something everyone gets?” Like a student ID.

Wen Zhi facepalmed; he could hardly believe it!

What a clueless junior sister!

He had failed to educate her on this!

“Junior sister, we don’t exploit our disciples! The dishes you made are concentrated natural power—better than pills! The Pill Sect uses pills to prove abilities, and your cooking also showcases your skills!”

Wait, her cooking had that effect? She’d thought the sect just lacked chefs!

She had even briefly wondered if this was the new cooking school for immortals in the cultivation world?

Seeing the confusion on her face, Wen Zhi continued: 

“And that disciple insignia isn’t just any insignia; only disciples who pass the sect assessment receive it. It denotes that you belong to our sect.”

What? The inner inscription of spiritual power obviously meant ownership—now she had someone to rely on in the future! She understood!

“You!” Master Gu lightly tapped her on the head.
 
“Didn’t you notice that the spiritual food you prepare actually incorporates your spiritual power? The meals we eat are beneficial for our cultivation. Otherwise, do you think we indulge in eating like Yu?”

Although that was indeed what she thought, she wouldn’t dare to say it!

“So, you mean you didn’t know?” Lin, the naive one, was bewildered even more than her junior sister! 

“Uh, big brother, even you know?” 

“Yeah, have you seen how much my cultivation has improved?” 

“...Not really!”

“......”

“Alright, enough teasing our little sister! After all, Lianlan comes from the lower mountains and joined late, so it’s not surprising she missed some common knowledge. You needn’t worry. Cooking is just part of the assessment; the real reason is… the Sugarcane Grove!”

“The Sugarcane Grove? Isn’t that the one I’ve been planting everywhere?”

“Yes, the Sugarcane Grove! Its defensive properties are well known! So I had your senior brothers and sisters take you around the sect to plant it everywhere!”

She thought they were just taking her on a tour around various mountains and enjoying the view while planting sugarcane.

“Moreover, it’s a treasure that can be eaten, and it can be turned into sugar—who wouldn’t want it? ... You, such a rare treasure, people would be scrambling for it! If it weren't for me being powerful enough to keep them at bay, our five person team wouldn’t be living so comfortably!”

As he spoke, it seemed he wanted to ensure she understood the dangers of the outside world, so he advised her cautiously: 

“Lianlan, you can feel free within the sect! Just be careful of everything once you leave the sect!”

“Okay!”

“Exactly, little sister, during the tournament, stay close to us. Don't fall for traps set by some foolish people!”

“If even the big brother is saying it, does that mean the sect is in any danger?”

Wen Zhi, not wanting to frighten her, spoke softly:

“Well, daily life is generally safe; in the sect, you needn’t worry too much. It’s just that during the Immortal Sect Grand Tournament, some nefarious individuals often sneak in to attack our disciples. Of course, this isn’t only a problem for our Lanshan Sect; other sects experience the same, hence the need for caution!”
