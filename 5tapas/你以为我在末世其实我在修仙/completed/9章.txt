**The Turbulent Times Have Arrived**

David Guan was alarmed to find that these monsters couldn’t be defeated no matter how hard he tried. Initially hesitant to harm them, as their numbers kept increasing, he realized he might not be able to escape unscathed. 

Gradually, he noticed that they seemed completely insensitive to pain; even if he knocked them down, they'd get back up. If this continued, he'd be in grave danger, so he couldn't afford to hold back. However, even when he did go all out, it proved futile as they would immediately rise again.

Gasping for breath, David observed the oncoming horde, racking his brain for a way to break through this predicament. Suddenly, a dirty, dark hand reached out from behind him... 

Just as the black claws were about to claw at him, David sensed the imminent danger from behind! He instinctively turned to fight back. As the danger escalated, he let out a loud shout that seemed to awaken his latent potential: 

With an explosive surge of power, golden blades grew astonishingly from his arms, perfectly merging with his physique, as if they had always belonged to him. 

Seeing his fists morph into two sharp blades, he swiftly struck down, severing a monster’s head, which finally caused the creature to collapse and stop moving.

Feeling the unusual texture of his transformed arms and glancing at the fallen monster, seasoned David was momentarily taken aback! 

So much so that he didn’t notice another monster's hand reaching toward him from behind… 

With a loud "bang," David instantly went into a defensive stance, turning to face the threat. 

What he saw shocked him: a young girl who should have been inside the house standing there, terrified, gripping a baseball bat tightly. 

Beside her lay a flat-headed creature. 

Though surprised, he quickly refocused. The most important thing right now was to escape! He pulled the brave girl, Clara, behind him and reassured her, “Don’t be afraid, I’m here.” 

Then he attacked the monsters in front of him. 

[“Clara, I… I think I just killed someone.”] 

[“No, Clara! They’re monsters; they aren’t humans anymore. They’re just creatures driven by instinct! You did great, you saved David! And it looks like David awakened some power! These monsters can’t compete with him! So there’s no need to fear!”] 

Watching David confidently entrust his safety to her, Clara steadied her trembling hands. 

But she knew she couldn’t hide behind someone forever. 

David heard a loud bang from behind him, and his heart relaxed with relief; she was indeed a capable girl! 

“Girl, aim for their heads.” 

“...Okay.” 

Until no more monsters appeared, Clara was so exhausted that she could barely lift her hands. 

As David’s golden blades felt their master no longer needed them, they slowly dissipated into the air. 

Fortunately, his rigorous training kept him in good shape as he caught his breath and guided Clara back while she leaned on the baseball bat for support. 

“Your name is Clara, right? You’re very brave.” 

Clara managed a weak smile, “Thank you, David.” 

“Just call me Uncle David,” he replied, his expression turning serious. “There are many monsters outside; it’s not safe for you to stay here alone at night. Why don’t you come back to my place?” 

“Ah?” 

Once inside, David let go of Clara’s support. 

“You’ve seen the dangers outside; it's even less safe for a girl like you to stay here. My place might not be big, but I can guarantee your safety.” 

He thought for a moment, took out his phone, and flipped to a photo. 

“This is my discharge certificate, and this is my heroism award, and…” 

Clara quickly waved her hands, “No, no, Uncle David, I know you’re a good person, I trust you.” 

David smiled, “Let’s gather your things and head out.” 

“Ah?” 

He really lived up to his military background—no time to waste, without giving her a chance to explain. 

“Uncle David, I’m safe here.” 

Worried the girl wouldn’t want to bother him, David persuaded her: 

“Clara, if you feel my place is too small, that’s alright. I have a friend with a nice house. Trust me; right now, it wouldn’t hurt to stay there.” 

“It’s not that, Uncle David! My home…” 

Before she could finish, a rumbling sound erupted outside. 

Having experienced this a few times, David and Clara realized that the ground was trembling while another storm was raging outside. 

David reached out to shield Clara, wanting to drag her to a safer open area, but just as they were about to step outside, he froze at the scene unfolding before him. 

Despite the houses in the distance collapsing and the sky flashing with lightning, he felt no tremors beneath him—only a loud noise, as he stood steadfast like a mountain. 

Moreover, the house still had power; they both knew the power supply had long been cut off. 

With the dim light from the cabin, David could see the slain monsters rolling and tearing apart in the shaking ground… 

Seeing David staring blankly, Clara panicked: Did they get exposed? 

Just as she was considering how to cover this up… No, how to explain it away. 

Suddenly, she heard David muttering, “So this place is really safe; I can't feel the tremors.” 

His eyes brightened as he surveyed the surroundings, and he patted Clara’s shoulder, “Clara, this place is really good.” 

Then he recalled something, slapping his forehead, “I almost forgot about my son, he’s still at home having a fever. I need to hurry back to check on him.” 

He rushed out without hesitation, speaking as if a storm was blowing through him! 

“Uncle David, I’m serious. It’s really not safe outside; you’ve seen…” 

“Clara, please just lock the door and stay put. I’ll be back later.” 

“Be careful, Uncle!” 

“Got it.” 

With that, he dashed out into the rain, slowly blending into the darkness. 

Once David was gone, Clara closed the door behind him. 

Lying in the bathtub surrounded by warm water, Clara finally calmed her racing thoughts, feeling the reality sink in: the turbulent times had indeed arrived! 

She needed to build new shelters; amidst disaster, no one could stand aside. Clara thought to herself. 

“Just get some rest tonight. I’m too tired.”

【Consumed 10 points to exchange for building materials and special flooring for the corridor. Current total energy: 37 points.】 

As she munched on some bread, storing the exchanged materials in her espace, she planned to build a shipping container house on the left side. 

She thought to herself that with David’s personality, he probably wouldn’t come looking for her again. 

Suddenly, a knock on the door startled her. Peering through the peephole, she saw David standing in the rain. 

Quickly, she opened the door, “Uncle David, you’re here?” 

Before David could respond, another voice chimed in. 

“Hey there, girl! I’m here too, haha!” 

The voice of David’s son, Ethan, was a bit hoarse but lively nonetheless. 

Clara followed David’s oddly helpless gaze and saw Ethan bundled under a pile of rain-resistant cloth on a three-wheeled cart, his face appearing rather unwell. 

“Come on in; it’s still raining outside!” 

She and David helped Ethan down. 

“Cough, cough, Clara, sorry to intrude. Things were chaotic at home yesterday, so we just…” 

“Hey, Dad, stop being so indecisive! Clara, the thing is, my house collapsed last night, so we’re here to seek refuge with you. Can you take us two in?” 

“A slap was heard. 

“Dad, why did you hit me? I was just stating facts!” 

“Clara, I meant no offense. Ethan is still sick, and my friend’s house also collapsed. Your home seems… relatively safe for now, so…” 

“No problem, Uncle David! I’m happy to have you!” 

“No, no, no! Just let Ethan stay here for one night; he can sleep on the floor.” 

Clara was momentarily dumbfounded. 

Then David scratched his head, feeling a bit embarrassed, and said, “I think the foundation here is pretty solid; since Ethan is sick, it’d be a hassle for you to let him stay for one night. I’ll just set up a tent somewhere close by. I’ll go back for our stuff; tomorrow I’ll pitch a larger tent, and then Ethan and I will move there.” 

As he spoke, he began unloading items from the cart. 

“I won’t just take up your space; I’ll contribute some supplies from home. Plus, as you saw, I’m still quite capable! I’ll ensure your safety moving forward. If any heavy lifting is needed, just leave it to me, alright?” 

“Yeah, Clara! I’ll sleep on the floor, even if it’s just a corner of the room. My dad is quite dependable; once I’m better, I can help out too.” 

Looking at their honest faces, Clara truly didn’t know what to say and regretted not building another house sooner. 

“It’s alright, Uncle! Just let Ethan stay here, you can focus on other things.” 

“Thank you so much, Clara!” 

After David took the little cart back to gather more items, Ethan came inside, his eyes widening. 

After being apart for just three days, Clara’s home had dramatically impressed him. 

What was once a cramped room had turned into a spacious living area, and through the right window, he could see patches of vibrant greenery, seemingly untouched by disaster. 

“Wow, Clara! I can’t believe how much this place has changed. It’s kind of embarrassing to even sit down now.” 

“Don’t worry about it; here, take a towel to dry yourself. Have you eaten? I can whip you up some porridge.” 

“Sure! Thank you, Clara; I won’t hold back! My dad and I didn’t sleep last night; we were too busy gathering our stuff. I came running to you first thing this morning, and I haven't had a bite yet.” 

Watching Ethan gobble down the porridge while praising her cooking skills, Clara pondered how to broach the topic when Ethan suddenly provided her the opening she needed.

After finishing, Ethan looked around and inquired in a conspiratorial tone, “Hey, Clara, can you be real with me? Do you have any special abilities too?”
