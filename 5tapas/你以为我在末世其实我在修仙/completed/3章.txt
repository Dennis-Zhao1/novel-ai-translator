**Full Load of Returns**

Gwen Lanlan was unaware that, with the countdown to the chaotic era ending, the world was undergoing drastic changes. 

Tsunamis, typhoons, floods, and earthquakes suddenly began wreaking havoc, almost as if they were in collusion. Even though scientists had predicted these disasters and prepared in advance, many people still could not escape the calamities. 

Yet in different parts of the world, there were always a few places that remained unshakeable no matter how severe the surrounding disasters were. The inhabitants leaned against or sat by the windows, watching the natural disasters unfold outside. 

Gwen’s small container seemed to be moving across the ground, but the occupants felt no disturbance from the swaying or the raging storms, continuing to sleep soundly. 

After waking naturally, Gwen got up to wash up, had a bit to eat, and looked around her cramped little room, feeling quite content. 

“Good morning, Sisi!” 

“Good morning, Gwen!” 

Seeing that the day’s tasks were set, Gwen thought about the long way they'd have to walk to the small town they had visited before. Surprisingly, she found over 2000 in cash in her pocket and felt odd about it; didn’t buying things have more advanced methods? It was just a fleeting thought, and Gwen didn’t dwell on it. 

Changing into fresh clothes, she opened the door but immediately stepped back to observe the surroundings. 

“Wait, what? Wasn’t I in a deserted area yesterday? Why does it look different today?” Next door were dilapidated houses, and faint cries echoed in the distance. 

Remembering what the system had said about the onset of chaos, a sense of dread settled in Gwen. 

“Sisi, how did we end up here?” 

“Because a great disaster occurred last night, and our house moved here with the ground.” 

“Oh my goodness, was it so terrifying? I didn’t feel a thing!” 

“Don’t worry, Gwen! Our shelter is the safest; earthquakes, fires, floods, explosions, we have nothing to fear.” 

“Really? It’s that impressive?” 

“Yep!” The little one puffed out her chest proudly. 

“What about the bases built by other warriors?” 

“Not the same! The other systems built relatively larger structures, which can be considered bases, so they focus their protection accordingly. Our house is tiny, making it simpler to protect, but it has more functionalities!” 

“... So being small has its advantages too.” 

“The main system said we can't be too high-profile; otherwise, our master might get captured. So usually we don’t let others discover us, not even other systems.” 

“That makes sense. Let’s go out and buy some things; it wouldn’t do for our house to protect me so well if I starve to death, right? That would be disappointing for your system!” 

“True! Alright, Gwen, hurry out to find some food!” 

“... Aren't you going to comfort me a little?” 

But there was no time to dwell on that; she decided to walk down the unfamiliar street. Many surrounding houses were partially sunken, some completely collapsed. 

Gradually, the cries of people grew louder, tightening Gwen’s brows. Fortunately, she could see rescue teams working tirelessly, covered in mud and dirt, having evidently been working since last night. 

Regardless, now she couldn’t help in any significant way; even if she wanted to save someone, that little 10-square-meter house couldn’t fit many people inside. 

“Let’s complete the tasks first,” Gwen reassured herself. “Maybe if I finish enough, I’ll find a way to help.” 

She finally arrived in a busier area of the town, which was even more chaotic — the sounds of wailing filled the air. Near a supermarket, she noticed the disarray; many items had been waterlogged, and it looked like the owner was trying to salvage what he could. 

Gwen approached, “Excuse me, sir, I urgently need to buy some supplies. Are these still for sale?” 

The owner was a kind-looking middle-aged man. Seeing a young girl asking, he responded without much enthusiasm, “Most of it is damaged from water. If you want to buy something, come back when we reopen.” 

Seeing his disinterest, Gwen felt uncertain. She continued down the road, unsure if she would find another store. 

She didn’t find another supermarket but spotted a small grocery store. The owner’s circumstances seemed pretty bad, as his son was anxiously discussing something with him while hugging a small box. 

“Dad, look, the internet says the apocalypse is coming! We shouldn’t waste our time here; let’s find a place to hide!” 

“What nonsense are you talking about? It’s just a disaster; the government won’t abandon us. Once things settle, we will continue running the store.” 

“Dad, no! The internet says these are signs of the end times! First, the natural disasters, then soon, zombies will appear! We can’t just sit still; we need to stock up on supplies and find a safe place to hide... and also...” 

Seeing some vegetables outside the store, Gwen thought for a moment and asked, “Sir, I really need to buy some things. Are these for sale?” 

The owner pondered a moment, “What are you looking to buy, little girl?” 

“I need some rice, flour, and vegetables.” 

“Alright. How much do you need? If you need a lot, I can deliver it to your home.” 

Gwen considered that she couldn't carry too much, so she selected a few bags of rice, flour, some seasonings, and many convenient instant meals. 

Noticing a nearby store had some slippers, she grabbed a pair, spending all the cash she had. 

With the chaos outside, she couldn’t know if money would hold any value later, so it was better to purchase practical items now. 

The owner loaded the supplies onto a small tricycle and called his son for help. Despite the son’s complaints, he obediently assisted his father. 

Seeing how much Gwen was buying, the owner included some miscellaneous items as a gift. 

“I'm going to continue sorting things out. My son will help you deliver to your house,” he said. 

“Thank you so much, sir. I appreciate it!” 

“Don’t mention it; it’s the least I can do. Guan Xin, stop complaining and help out!” 

As Gwen hopped on the small tricycle, she felt satisfied looking at the abundance of food that could last her several months.
