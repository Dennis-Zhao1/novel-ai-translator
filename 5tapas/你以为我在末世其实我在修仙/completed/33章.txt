**Apprenticed**

*Knock, knock, knock...*

"Who is it? Come in!"

Hearing the knock at the door startled Gailan Lan as she sprang up from her bed! Realizing this was not the end of the world, she rubbed her eyes and yawned before slowly getting out of bed to open the door.

"It’s me, your senior sister."

As she opened the door, she saw her senior sister, Clara Wen, standing there holding a basin of water and some toiletries. Gailan quickly stepped forward to take them, feeling a bit shy.

"Sister, I can manage it myself!"

Wen stepped aside and carried the items inside.

"You’re still young; come wash up quickly! Master will be here soon."

"Huh????" That came so suddenly!

With no time to waste, Gailan hurried to freshen up. Her hair was a mess, and Clara couldn’t help but style it into a pretty look, adding some lovely pink accessories.

Freshly made Gailan Lan was ready to go!

Clara looked at her little junior sister, who she had dressed up, and a motherly smile flickered on her face. 

On the mountain, it had been just senior brothers and younger brothers; even the occasional presence of the Master was all male. 

Finally, there was a cute, delicate little junior sister, and Clara couldn’t help but want to dress her up beautifully every day. 

She had secretly prepared an entire wardrobe, but with time running short, she planned to pick out more clothes when she had the chance.

"My little junior sister, I will take care of you!"

"Sister, do I look… inappropriate?"

"You look perfect! Where can we find such a cute little sister? Come on, let’s go meet Master together."

Gailan had seen the world and was curious as they walked along. She wondered what Master would be like. Would he really look as youthful as the legends described, ancient yet maintaining a boyish appearance? 

Or perhaps he was a wise elder with a spark of youthful spirit? 

Feeling the silence from her little sister, Clara assumed she was nervous and spoke soothingly: 

"Don’t worry, little sister; Master is very kind."

"Hmm." 

Gailan wasn’t afraid—it was just her mind running wild!

But she had misunderstood; Master Qingshan was a tall and gentle-looking handsome man. Perhaps it was due to his innate spiritual energy, he was very approachable!

Indeed, the immortals on this mountain were all quite friendly.

Before much more could be said, Lin Yu sprinted to Gailan's side, cupping his mouth to whisper, "Little sister, are you really named Gourd Rice?"

*Pfft~*

"What? What are you talking about?"

"Gourd Rice!"

"Did you make a mistake? My name is Gailan Lan!"

Did the name mean "Gourd Rice" instead of hers?

"I saw the name registered as 'Gourd Rice'!"

"Don’t joke around, Xiao Yu! It’s Lan’er, right? Come over here to Master."

Master’s senior brother was holding a cup of tea, indicating for her to present it to Master Qingshan.

"Don’t worry, the trial transportation won’t have any issues! Just serve this tea, and you’ll be my disciple! Once you’re my disciple, those mistakes don’t matter."

Oh, was it that casual?

Feeling a gentle nudge from behind and seeing encouraging glances from the others, Gailan respectfully offered the tea to Master Qingshan.

"Master, please have tea!"

"Good, good! My dear disciple, please get up. This is a gift I’ve prepared for you. I often travel and explore. If you have any questions, ask your senior brothers and sisters. They’re all good kids. If you encounter any difficulties, remember to call me back to resolve them for you!"

With that, he handed her a magical bag.

"Thank you, Master!" 

"And this is your senior brother, Adam Wen; this is your senior sister, Clara Wen. They are siblings. And this little rascal is your junior brother, Lin Yu. Our Mount Wanzhi has simple folks—let’s all get along, okay?"

"Yes, Master!"

"Yes, Master!"

"Got it, Master!"

"Yes, Master!"

The junior siblings all echoed with different tones!

"Little sister, this is a gift from your senior brother. I hope you like it."

It was a beautifully crafted sword.

"Your sister prepared some clothes and snacks; they are all in this magical bag." 

It was a fragrant pouch embroidered with plum flowers.

"Little sister, and I too! I picked out a few things for you, although not too much! Next time I go to my cave, if you see anything you like, just take it!"

He handed her a beautiful white jade bracelet—surprisingly, it even had storage space! 

"Thank you, senior brother, sister, and junior brother!"

Her senior brother helped her activate it, and although she wasn’t sure how it was done, it didn’t hurt as much as she had expected, feeling more like a mosquito bite.

"Alright! I still have some urgent matters to attend to. You all get along, and if anything comes up, let me know! I’m off!"

With that, he waved his sleeve and left without a trace.

What a master who came and went like the wind!

"Now that Master, senior brother, and sister have all left, what should I do?"

"Follow me! Let’s head to the flower garden and check your spiritual energy!" 

Because they were both women, it was mainly Clara who guided her.

As they approached the vibrant garden, it felt less like a garden and more like an endless expanse.

Although Gailan didn’t particularly love flowers, seeing so many beautiful blossoms and smelling their fragrance was delightful…

“Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!”

"What’s wrong? Are you catching a cold?"

"…Sister, it’s fine; it seems… Achoo… it’s just that the flowers are really fragrant!"

"See! I told you it’s unusually fragrant here!" 

Lin Yu had tied a scarf around his nose and stubbornly offered one to Gailan.

“…”

"Zhi Zhi, let’s head to the bamboo forest; little sister might be allergic to the flower pollen."

In the bamboo grove, Clara explained how to communicate with her spiritual energy. In summary, it boiled down to: 

Close your eyes, feel the surroundings' elements, then use your thoughts to grasp them.

As for what "thought" was? Don’t ask; just those who completed the trials would naturally know. 

Gailan was also curious about what kind of abilities she, an ordinary person, might possess.

Closing her eyes...

How fascinating! She could truly feel surrounded by various elements, like being underwater.

The difference was that water was all the same color, while the elements flowed in different colors—she could easily sense which colors were most familiar to her.

When it came to grasping, she instinctively reached out her hand, moving towards a somewhat thicker "stream" of element flowing by and feeling as though she had caught something.

"Senior brother, what is this?" her junior brother asked in confusion.

"I’ve never seen this before; it wasn’t mentioned in the books!" her senior brother replied calmly, frowning slightly.

"It truly looks unfamiliar! But its appearance resembles bamboo somewhat!" her sister’s puzzled voice chimed in.

"Little sister, it’s time! You can open your eyes and take a look!" 

Gailan opened her eyes and was stunned to see what was in her hand.
