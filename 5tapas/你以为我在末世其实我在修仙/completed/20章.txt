**Tea Gathering**

After a brief look around, David Wang expressed his desire to visit the owner of this base.

Following Uncle Guan and Doctor Hua, they walked to a small courtyard not far from home. Compared to the nearby containers, this three-story container courtyard wasn’t much more luxurious.

Hearing that Team Hua had matters to discuss, Clara Joy was also looking for them, so she had tidied up her small courtyard in advance.

The five of them settled under the sunshade in the courtyard; it had been a long time since they had felt such tranquility!

The air was fragrant with fruit, and a branch extended beyond the wall.

On the table were freshly brewed tea, a fruit platter, a dish of sunflower seeds, a box of snacks, and a plate of small cakes.

In these trying times, this place felt more like a tea gathering from a peaceful era.

“Miss Clara, hello! The main reason for our visit today is to express our gratitude. Thank you for protecting the residents of this town, and thank you for looking out for my loved ones. Thank you!”

With that, he and his companion, Oliver, both bowed respectfully to her.

Clara was a bit flustered; she felt somewhat undeserving of their thanks, as she believed she hadn’t done much.

“No, no, it’s the least I could do! Plus, this isn’t just my effort; the safety of the entire community relies on everyone working together to achieve what we have today.”

“I’ve heard about your efforts from my parents. Regardless, I must thank you.”

“Lilian, that gratitude is something he should express; don’t feel shy!”

“...Alright, I’ll graciously accept the thanks! Please, just call me Clara,” she replied, considering they were all of similar age.

“Then we won’t be polite. This is our team’s space power enhancer and the materials manager for our squad, Oliver.”

Oliver flashed a brilliant smile and cheerfully asked, “Hey there, Clara!”

“Um, hi!” Something felt slightly off!

“Clara, does your base lack anything?”

“Well, I’m actually called Clara.”

“Yes, indeed, Clara.”

Huh? This tall, seemingly cultured fellow seemed to have a strong accent!

She’s Clara, not ‘Clara,’ the tones are quite different!

“...”

Clara sighed, while Oliverfacepalmed at the mix-up!

Forget it; the important matters at hand took precedence—there was no need to focus on such minor details.

“Our base currently lacks very few resources; most of what we need is being produced in-house. You’ve likely noticed as the first guests at the base, we have no issues with food or clothing.”

“However, we are in a somewhat remote location, and with the communication systems down, our base has been cut off from the outside world for quite some time. If we were to name our shortages, it would probably be talent and weapons, as well as reestablishing our communication network.”

Oliver took out a small notebook and began jotting down notes while staying quiet.

They had agreed the day before that they couldn’t just consume resources without offering something in return, so they were considering bringing supplies to the base!

However, finding talent and weapons was not likely to be easy, especially since they were generally in demand everywhere.

He glanced over at their quiet leader, and at that moment, he really missed his buddy, Max.

“Clara, the two issues you mentioned can be resolved if we manage to connect with the outside world; both talent and weaponry won’t pose a problem. I believe there are plenty of people out there in need of food.”

“Our food production is already at a scale, so if it’s just food that’s needed, I think we can manage,” she smiled and continued, “Actually, we have been planning to send people out to establish connections with the outside world, and your arrival couldn’t have come at a better time!”

“That’s true! But, Clara, pardon my bluntness, but for such a large base, do you not plan to build any defensive works?”

“Well, you see, we haven’t yet determined the scope of our base's construction. Without any professional guidance and considering the unique situation of our base, we haven’t dedicated manpower or resources to that aspect. But since you’re here, we would love your expert guidance!”

“That’s absolutely no problem! Do you have any other questions?”

“Well, I do! The base is constructed based on our current population, and honestly, this size has turned out to be the most appropriate right now.”

As Sisi mentioned, the current size of the base is the largest she can manage effectively. It’s possible to explore new paths and build additional bases, but the level of safety certainly won’t be as high as in this core area.

“I’m not sure how other bases are, but you’ve seen quite a few, so I want to ask, what do you think of this base?”

“It’s quite good! Food is good, accommodation is nice, and people are friendly. It’s just that your defenses are too weak.”

Oliver glanced over at their leader, who was too busy enjoying tea, and thought their leader wasn’t suitable for this role.

“Also, may I ask, why is your base called ‘Sugarcane Base’?”

Clara unconsciously brushed aside the latter question!

“Oh, that’s fine! At present, defense doesn’t pose too much of a problem.” But that wasn’t the question I had in mind.

Fortunately, there was someone who understood, and David Wang offered a candid evaluation: “From what I see, the scale of Sugarcane Base is adequate for now; there’s no need to waste manpower on expansion. Your ability to be self-sufficient is indeed commendable, but communication, defense, research, education, and military capabilities are lacking. Without establishing contact with the outside world, should an emergency arise, we won’t even be able to send out a distress signal. If a powerful enemy were to attack, it could be very dangerous given the personnel quality and firepower at the base.”

Oliver nodded in agreement, “Right, you’d be taken out before anyone heard a sound.”

“...”

“And given your ample resources, it’s like a big, tempting feast. Many factions are already establishing their bases, and we’re currently in a phase of resource division. To be honest, we’ve come across many bases with far superior defense capabilities, firepower, and technology than yours! If possible, the safest approach is to establish contact with higher authorities and create mutually beneficial relationships with nearby bases to ensure long-term sustainability.”

“I understand all that, but as you can see, our base’s military capability is too low; a single shell could wipe us out. Without being able to ensure personnel safety, quite frankly, I feel like we’re just delivering groceries to the enemy. So, I’ve been waiting for an opportunity.”

“I can assure you!”

David Wang looked at the young girl before him, “I can assure you of your safety. If possible, I will use a satellite phone to report the situation to the government and secure more resources and better development for Sugarcane Base.”

He added, “After all, this is my home too.”

Clara gazed at his resolute expression and the noticeable anticipation from Uncle Guan and Doctor Hua. She stood up and extended her hand, “I trust you! So, here’s to a fruitful partnership!”

The others stood as well, clapping joyfully.

David Wang, towering at 6’2”, had to bend down to shake hands with her little hand.

“Here’s to a fruitful partnership!”

Hmm~ It gave off the feeling of humoring a little kid—cough, definitely just an illusion!

Having reached an agreement, Clara thought for a moment that there was one situation that still needed clarification.

“You must have encountered quite a few bases on your journey. I have a question; could you help me with it?”

“Please go ahead!”
