**A Sweet Victory**

The grand competition of the immortal sects had entered a new level of intensity!

Those who truly understood the competition knew that for the earlier contestants who relied on brute strength or luck to advance, this was just the beginning!

The initial rounds were designed to sift out potential winners. This year, Wan Zhi Mountain of Lian Mountain Sect had unexpectedly produced rising stars—several individuals who were usually mild-mannered and more interested in cultivation than combat had become dark horses.

Although it was typical for Wan Jian Mountain's disciples to take home the championship trophy every year, many disciples from Lian Mountain expressed their desire to see other sects win. "It gets a bit boring when Wan Jian Mountain wins all the time."

“Senior Brother, you’re here to watch the competition from Wan Zhi Mountain too?”

“Yeah! I heard that Wan Zhi Mountain has lots of handsome guys and beautiful girls. Much better to look at than that rowdy crowd from Wan Jian Mountain!”

“Hey? Junior Brother, that’s not fair! You can’t judge just by appearances!”

“Uh!”

“The little junior sister from Wan Zhi Mountain may look petite, but her fighting prowess is impressive!”

“Ah! Exactly! By the way, we just came from the sect; which one is the little junior sister from Wan Zhi Mountain?”

“Look over there! That small figure in purple is fighting calmly!”

On the sidelines, several relaxed disciples were drinking tea, clearly at ease compared to the intense atmosphere surrounding the Sword Sect fighters.

But they were indeed envious; each of the Wan Zhi Mountain's contestants had deep-seated connections to the immortal realm, completely unaffected by the competition for resources. Even the one ordinary disciple accepted this year was exceptionally talented!

Look, even Ouyang Yue from the Sword Sect, famed for unleashing a myriad of swords, couldn’t break through the “Sugar Cane Wall” that the little junior sister casually laid out. Let alone harm her.

Yet, when the little junior sister from Wan Zhi Mountain swung her stick, Ouyang Yue’s sword was completely deformed!

Did you see Ouyang Yue’s expression? It was tragic!

But the onlookers were enjoying every moment! The Sword Sect disciples boasted daily about being the world's strongest sword fighters, but they were far less low-key than Wan Zhi Mountain.

And they harbored aspirations of replacing Wan Jian Mountain? Ha! Even the weakest fighter from Wan Zhi Mountain little junior sister could easily defeat them!

How embarrassing!

However, some observant individuals noted that Gan Lanlan’s attitude toward the matches had also changed: Initially, she thought, "I’ll just go and participate as my masters suggested," but now it seemed to have shifted to "Let’s finish this quickly; I have urgent matters to attend to!" She was truly relentless on the field!

The Sword Sect had unknowingly run into a formidable opponent!

Once she was in the zone, Gan Lanlan resembled a college graduate taken back to kindergarten—learning basic arithmetic once more. It's rarer to see someone thrive in such a setting!

In merely a few exchanges, the Sword Sect disciples were sent flying!

The Lian Mountain Sect participants watching the “show”—ahem, cheering—were utterly thrilled!

By the time Gan Lanlan left the arena, she was swamped with gifts from her peers of different sects. A senior brother from Xian Yao Mountain presented her with a bottle of elixirs, “Little junior sister, this is a gift from me! Hahaha, you did great!”

He tossed her a magic bag filled with spirit tools, saying, “You did well. Take this and play with it!”

Even the senior sister from Wan Jian Mountain gifted a beautiful sword, “Though it’s not as effective as your ‘Purple Divine Stick,’ it’s still a token of my appreciation. Please accept it!”

“Um, thank you, everyone…” She clutched her pile of gifts, bewildered by the unexpected outpouring of goodwill!

Wen Zhi assisted in collecting them and laughed, “Take them, little junior sister! Our sect values kindness above all. Besides, you’ve cultivated quite a few sugarcane fields for them; it’s only right you receive some gifts in return.”

“Alright then!”

In the end, no surprises emerged: only Gan Lanlan and Wen Gu from Wan Zhi Mountain made it to the top ten of the competition. Unfortunately, Wen Gu ultimately lost to the strongest fighter from Wan Jian Mountain, Xuan Yuan Hao, in a narrow defeat.

It was understandable, given that sword cultivators had an impressive striking power!

As for Gan Lanlan, those who had witnessed her matches knew that initially, a single sugarcane was sufficient to handle opponents. However, as she faced tougher challengers, her techniques grew increasingly inventive!

Occasionally, she would trap her enemies within seals made of sugarcane—no one would be injured, yet she emerged victorious!

The newly arrived disciples from Lian Mountain looked at the sugarcane on stage, struggling to connect it to the sugarcane fields they had planted!

Glancing at the snacks they had brought, they found themselves reluctant to nibble on them, especially seeing that the sugarcane on stage was tough enough that neither their techniques nor sword energy could cut through it. They collectively fell into silence!

Maybe, just maybe… the little junior sister Lanlan used a different variety of sugarcane during the matches? After all, these couldn’t possibly be plants susceptible to their biting!

No matter how good their teeth were, they couldn’t challenge the strength of the spirit swords or magical artifacts! Yet, they usually enjoyed gobbling up sugarcane!

They would need to ask Lanlan how she could refine sugarcane to be tougher than a spirit sword! They … were very much interested!

Further into the competition, a strong showing continued, captivating Gan Lanlan's interest as she secretly picked up techniques.

Moreover, she had rightfully become the strongest dark horse of this competition, advancing to the finals!

In the finals, unexpectedly, Gan Lanlan faced off against Xuan Yuan Hao, the strongest of the current generation from Wan Jian Mountain!

“From Lian Mountain Sect, Wan Jian Mountain—Xuan Yuan Hao!”

“From Lian Mountain Sect, Wan Zhi Mountain…”

“Little junior sister, I recognize you! I’ve watched your matches; you are indeed strong!” 

Xuan Yuan Hao's Haotian Sword emitted an ominous hum, brimming with battle intent.

“You’re formidable as well!”

After all, my senior brother lost to you, and my little brother insisted I must win!

“Though we are from the same sect, I will not hold back!” 

“No need to! Please!” 

One wielded a sword while the other raised… a sugarcane; it seemed an uneven match by presence.

Xuan Yuan Hao made the first move, lunging forward with his sword!

Gan Lanlan, undeterred, lunged with her sugarcane!

The collision unleashed a wave of formidable sword energy, forcing weaker disciples nearby to retreat!

After separating, Xuan Yuan Hao executed a horizontal slash!

Feeling the strength of his attack, Gan Lanlan raised her sugarcane to block, swiftly countering with a clockwise sweep!

Xuan Yuan Hao deftly dodged and went low, spinning his sword to stab at Gan Lanlan's chest.

With a flash of purple, a new sugarcane emerged to deflect his sword!

The two retreated to opposite sides of the stage; Gan Lanlan held her “sugarcane stick” in a defensive stance. 

Xuan Yuan Hao felt the tremble of his Haotian Sword, shaking his numbed arm!

His resolve hardened; it appeared he had underestimated his opponent.

It was clear that brute strength wouldn't suffice; he had to resort to techniques!

“Go!”

With a single swing, he conjured a multitude of swords that created a ring-shaped sword formation behind him!

Gan Lanlan, witnessing this familiar scene, intended to form a “Sugar Cane Wall” for defense; however...

“Go!”

With a movement, a single sugarcane transformed into one hundred thousand in a circular formation behind her!

The skies shone purple, and her "cane array" was larger and denser than his!

On the sidelines, Lin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter, “Hahaha, little junior sister, well played! You just returned what he gave you! Senior brother, look, our little junior sister avenged you!”

Even the usually composed Wen Gu paused before shaking his head lovingly!

Wen Zhi covered her mouth, giggling: “Our little junior sister is still just a kid!”

Even Master Qing Yang stroked his beard, nodding in satisfaction—his dear disciple was doing splendidly!

On stage, Xuan Yuan Hao was utterly caught off guard by her mirroring his strategy.

“Little junior sister, how did you learn this move?!”

Gan Lanlan shrugged, “Just watched and picked it up!”

“…” I spent ages mastering this move, and you say you just learned by watching?

“Shall we continue?”

Regaining his composure, Xuan Yuan Hao decided on one more exchange: “Bring it on!”

“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…” All swords converged on Gan Lanlan!

The sugarcane array seemed to spring into action, instantly forming new barriers before her.

Focusing bravely, he retracted his sword, while Gan Lanlan’s sugarcane array stood unchanged in the air!

Xuan Yuan Hao pursed his lips, “I concede!”

Gan Lanlan instantly retracted her overwhelming purple energy and bowed respectfully, “Thank you, senior brother!”

Seeing the prowess with which the little junior sister controlled her techniques, Xuan Yuan Hao had to concede—this year’s newcomers were indeed fierce! 

Nonetheless, “Little junior sister, let’s spar again in the future!”
“Sure, senior brother!”

The announcer could no longer contain himself and proclaimed loudly, “The winner of the Lian Mountain Sect’s Wan Zhi Mountain is… Gan Lanlan!”

“I announce that the champion of this immortal sects tournament is… Gan Lanlan of Lian Mountain Sect!”

A round of cheers erupted from the crowd below.

“Ah!! Master, our little junior sister won! We did it!”

“We won!”

“Our little junior sister triumphed!”

“Woo-hoo!”

“…”

“…Hey? Where’s little junior sister?”

“She was just up on the stage!”

“It’s fine; she’ll eventually return to the sect! Let’s celebrate first with some spirit wine!”

“Let’s go, let’s go~”

As for Gan Lanlan, what was she up to at this moment?
