**So, I'm the worst one.**

**[Sisi, I have an uneasy feeling.]**  
**[Yes, Master, your feeling is correct; after all, the chaos is only 10 minutes away.]**  
**[......]**  
**[You don't need to sigh. If you have any questions, you can tell Sisi, and I can help you solve them!]**  
**[Can you tell me where I am? Where did I come from? What is this chaos?]**  
**[Alright, searching... Master, you are in a shelter. You just returned from the supermarket. The situation with the chaos is quite complex; I will upload the information to the StarNet shortly so you can take a look.]**  
**[......]** This answer isn’t entirely wrong, but it feels like it answered everything while answering nothing at all.  
Earlier while working, it seems StarNet was automatically blocked, but now that it has reappeared, the task shows completed, and there’s even a reward.  
Then the information about the chaos begins to load...  
**[Chaos: As the name suggests, a chaotic world is about to commence.]**  
**[Dear esteemed collaborator of StarNet, in order to seek a survival path for humanity amid the inevitable chaos, and to prevent the advent of the apocalypse, StarNet has randomly selected 1,000 individuals with different identities. Based on their rankings in identity and ability, they will fight to defend humanity's home. Number 1000, you are a soldier in the defense battle for the Sugarcane Home, please work hard with your StarNet system and strive to fight!]**  
**[Countdown to chaos: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The chaotic world has come, and the future of humanity depends on all of you, warriors. Sincerely from the main system of StarNet.]**  
**[So, Sisi... Am I the worst one among these 1,000 people?]**  
**[Yes, Master, according to the ranking, you are last!]**  
Well, no need to say that out loud, thank you!  
**[Then Sisi, is there also a ranking among your systems? Like, for example, are you ranked too, cough, you know... that kind?]**  
**[Yes, Master, we do have rankings. My system program is relatively simple; if it's the strongest system, even in the initial stage, the constructed shelter could be as large as a huge campus.]**  
**[Oh, okay, then I really owe you one.]**  
**[Not at all, Master! We can improve together!]**  
Gan Lanlan stood up and looked out the window. The system said chaos had arrived, but perhaps due to her remote location, she didn’t see any changes. After thinking for a moment, she closed the internal window.  
**[Hey, Sisi, cough cough, I have a question, can you change your voice? Your image and voice are really a bit... uh...]**  
**[Of course, Master! I have many voice options; you can choose whichever you like.]**  
Thus, Gan Lanlan witnessed a fluffy creature producing various strange sounds. Ultimately, she chose a cute and silly voice, and with the selection of the voice program, it seemed her personality also underwent a big change.  
**[Lanlan, should we start the next task now?]**  
**[Huh? The next task. Let me take a look.]**  
**[Task 2] Please decorate the shelter into a livable environment.**  
Icons began to appear on StarNet’s interface, including beds, chairs, toilets, pots, pans, and more.  
Gan Lanlan was just lamenting the difficulty of life, but at this moment, she felt as though heaven would not forsake her, hahaha.  
There were many styles and varieties, but each had a different energy point cost. Looking at one exceedingly comfortable bed priced at 1,000 energy points, she chuckled and said goodbye.  
Perhaps a warrior ranked 1,000 doesn’t deserve to live in a nice house.  
Flipping to the last page, she unexpectedly found a package that included:  
1. A bed with sheets and a matching comforter;  
2. A toilet, showerhead, and a sink with a mirror;  
3. A kitchen gas stove, a set of pots and pans, and a rice cooker;  
4. A kettle, a thermos, a complete tea set, and a set of tables and chairs;  
5. A small wardrobe, a small washing machine, and a small refrigerator.  
Including installation fees, it totaled 10 energy points, and it even came with two sets of blue sportswear. Overall, it could be said to be quite a bargain.  
However, if bought separately, even the pots, pans, bedding, and pillows would each cost energy points. Self-installation might be too challenging for her skills, so there was no need to choose; she simply spent 10 energy points.  
This felt like a newbie benefit; otherwise, such value couldn’t possibly be exchanged for just 10 energy points.  
Soon, items from the package began to appear around her, quickly filling the entire house.  
Gan Lanlan looked at the neatly arranged room and felt happy; this suddenly gave the place a sense of home.  
After a hard day’s work, she even had the opportunity to take a shower. She definitely needed to wash up and get some sleep. Even more astonishingly, the faucet could emit hot water—simply too great!  
After washing up and tidying up the food and drinks in the refrigerator and kitchen, she thought about needing to go out to buy some supplies tomorrow.  
A good night’s sleep awaited her.  
**[Task 2] Completed. Reward: 10 energy points. Current total energy: 10 points.**  
**[Task 3] The chaos needs supplies; please stock up on provisions for the shelter.**
