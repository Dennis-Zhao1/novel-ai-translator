**"Tell me, how do you know this?"**

As the senior brother and sister entered their retreat, Mount Wan Zhi suddenly appeared desolate...

Not really, the residents of Monster Village had recently moved up the mountain, and it was bustling with activity!

Village Chief David Hu looked at the newly built green brick houses, tears welling up in his eyes from the overwhelming emotion.

Lucy Wei was as excited as a child, exploring every inch of their new home!

"Village Chief, we have a new home!"

"Yes, we finally have a proper place to live."

As the master of Mount Wan Zhi, Master Qing Yang rarely made an appearance.

As an old acquaintance, Clara Gan took the initiative to introduce:

"Village Chief, this is my master, Master Qing Yang. Master, this is Village Chief David."

"Greetings, Master! Thank you for providing us shelter," David said, bowing deeply.

The excited villagers were about to kneel!

Master Qing Yang waved his sleeve, and a gentle force lifted the villagers back up.

Although he had seen them through a distant mirror, facing them directly made his heart ache!

Looking at them, they were just over fifty, yet had endured so much hardship! Their backs were bent, their clothes worn and tattered, some were blind, deaf, or had physical disabilities...

These pitiful elders gazed at him cautiously, fearing that one wrong move could send them away!

Ah, his disciples had indeed done a good deed this time! They saved this group of unfortunate souls!

"Dear villagers, there's no need for such formality. Mount Wan Zhi is the friendliest place; you can rest easy here. Moreover, we have few people around, and my disciples you all know will take care of you. In the future, just find them if there’s anything you need!"

Fearing he might sound too official, he added:

"From now on, this is your home!"

Unexpectedly, this statement burst open their emotions like a broken faucet; the villagers began to cry uncontrollably:

"Woo… thank you… Master! We ask for nothing more than to live our remaining days peacefully! We won't trouble you, Master!"

Master Qing Yang couldn’t bear to see this and worried that these elders might cry themselves sick. He quickly encouraged them:

"Please, go inside and take a look! If you’re missing anything, just tell Clara. She will arrange everything."

"Thank you, Master!"

"Thank you, Master!"

"Thank you, Master!"

…

Watching the villagers repeatedly express their gratitude, Master Qing Yang couldn't help but let out a soft sigh!

Seeing that they showed no signs of stopping their tears, Clara promptly changed the subject:

"Village Chief, this will be your home from now on! Why don’t we give your new home a name?"

David Hu clumsily asked, "What… we used to call it Monster Village! If we don’t call it that, what should we call it?"

"… Since you’ve moved to a new place, it won’t do to keep that inauspicious name! This is your new home, a whole new beginning. It deserves a good new name!"

The Village Chief quickly stepped forward: "Master, we’re just simple mountain folk who can’t even read. Please, bestow a name on us!"

Well, it’s funny that the three big characters “Monster Village” at your gate are quite well-written! Just a bit unlucky!

However, seeing the hopeful gazes of the Village Chief and the villagers, Clara, who was terrible at naming, thought of a few names that flashed through her mind: Longevity Village, Peace Village, South Town Village, Retirement Village...

"How about we call it 'Sugarcane Village'!"

That familiar voice from behind!

That familiar sound of operations!

That elusive immortal!

It was none other than Master Nan Hua!

However, a village named “Sugarcane” sounds quite nostalgic! Moreover, the newly built village was located near sugarcane fields, making the name quite fitting!

"Sugarcane Village, it sounds great!" No matter what name the Master gave, it would be good! They needed to recognize it immediately! However...

"May I ask, Master, what does 'sugarcane' mean?"

Lin Yu, who had been silent, finally seized the opportunity to speak up:

“Village Chief, look over there! That purple plant is sugarcane! Its outer skin can be peeled off, and it’s edible. It’s juicy and sweet, but remember to spit out the pulp. It can also be used to make sugar.”

"There's such a magical plant!!"

Thinking about how Kuan Xin in the apocalypse often said that sugarcane symbolizes sweetness... Lately, she couldn’t shake off those memories. Shaking her head, she tried to dismiss the thoughts.

"Village Chief, sugarcane also represents sweetness. I hope you can step out of suffering and live sweetly from now on."

David Hu had never known that at his age, his tears were growing less valuable!

"Great! Step out of suffering and live sweetly! Let’s call it 'Sugarcane Village'! We have a new name now! Come on, let's write it down!"

Watching the joyful, childlike expressions on the elders’ faces as they gathered together!

Even with their hardships, their movements slow and deliberate… they still had a love for life!

Isn’t that just wonderful?!

*[Gan Lanlan.]*

Feeling a sudden weight in her hand, Clara Gan reached out to catch the suddenly appearing small white beast:

*["Si Si, you’re awake?"]*

*[“Mm-hmm, I woke up when I heard ‘Sugarcane Village’. Clara, are you going to build a base again?”]*

*[“Not exactly... but kind of! I will protect these villagers.”]*

*[“Mm-hmm, the people you protect are also the ones I protect.”]*

*[“Thank you, Si Si. Thank you for always supporting me!”]*

*[“It’s what I should do! Because I love Clara the most!”]*

As it said this, it rubbed its soft fur against Clara's cheek, and she couldn’t help but laugh and return the gesture!

Si Si smelled wonderful, warm and fluffy, satisfying her senses!

Looking in the direction where Master Nan Hua had left, she frowned slightly!

*[“Clara, what are you looking at?”]*

*[“Nothing!”]*

Just that!

If “zombies” were merely her mishearing, what about “Sugarcane Village”? Was that also a coincidence?

"Junior Sister, what are you in a daze for? Everyone’s all packed up! Come on, let's set off some firecrackers to celebrate!"

"Okay, I’m coming! Wait for me!"

---

**That night, Clara sat alone in the pavilion, holding Si Si, gazing at the moon.**

Her master usually didn’t care for them at night, and her senior brother had long disappeared.

With her senior brother and sister in closed-door training, she had been feeling quite lonely!

"Enjoying the moon by yourself?"

Without needing to turn around, she already knew who it was!

Caressing Si Si’s fur, she retorted, "Master seems rather idle?"

"Naturally!"

"……"

She felt frustrated; every time she talked to him, it felt like a breath got stuck in her throat! 

Her hands itched, wanting to hit someone!

She sensed someone sit down beside her and silently shifted to the side. Thankfully, the other person didn’t invade her space!

She only heard him chuckle softly: "What? Don’t you have many questions to ask me?"

"Oh? Does the Master think he’s a worm in my stomach? Do you know everything?"

Seeing the aloof child next to her, Master Nan Hua didn’t push any further.

After all, once he finished speaking, the child would surely come begging to ask!

"Zombies are humans mutated by a virus in the apocalypse, categorically a new species. The major forces in that era established bases, and coincidentally, there was a special base named 'Sugarcane Base'! Oddly enough, the base leader was also called Clara Gan."

Ignoring the startled look from the child beside him, he continued gazing at the moon:

"Unfortunately, as the Ice Age came, neither the zombies nor humans could survive the severe cold."

"You… how do you know this?"

"Doctors in Hu, and Uncle Kuan both died of natural causes—they lived long lives. Team Leader Hu ultimately returned to the military, which was his lifelong pursuit. Doctor Zhong devoted his life to studying survival strategies in the apocalypse. He was a respected figure across the nation..."

"I asked how you know all this!" Clara's voice grew louder from excitement!

But alas, the man remained as unyielding as a rock, impervious to her insistence!

"Clara Gan, leader of the Sugarcane Base, established a shelter for ordinary people during the apocalypse. After suffering injuries while combating a meteor, she soon fell ill and passed away. Following her death, she was posthumously awarded the Peace Medal by Hu Country, and her contributions were recorded in the nation’s history."

"You... how... do... you... know… this?" 

Noticing the child's teeth gritting in anger, Master Nan Hua finally turned to look her in the eyes with unusual seriousness: 

"If I told you I was also there, would you believe me?"

Clara let go of his arm, instinctively taking a step back: 

"How could that be? Wasn’t that just a dream?"

"No, it was indeed a dream!"

"Impossible!!! If it’s a dream… then it’s my dream! How could you know?"

Sigh, although she wanted to provoke the child, it seemed like she had prodded a bit too hard.

"Because of the grand event at Lan Mountain Sect, I entered your dream!"
