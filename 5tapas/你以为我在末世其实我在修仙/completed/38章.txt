**Look at the Sky, It's Meal Time**

Lin Yu subtly signaled to his junior sister, hinting to look up at the sky.

Gan Lanlan, puzzled, glanced upward and thought, "What’s up there? Could it be an airplane?"

Master Qingyang finally snapped back to reality and turned to see his little disciple and… his former little disciple both gazing at the sky, completely stumped by whatever silent puzzle they were trying to solve.

“Yuer, do you have a problem with your eyes?”

“Ah? Master, it’s nothing! I was just looking at the sky…”

Everyone else followed suit, peering upwards. The sky was a clear blue with an occasional passing cloud, which indeed looked quite beautiful!

Wen Zhi couldn’t help but tease him, “Those clouds are nice, but I’ve never seen you so interested in the sky before, junior brother!”

“Senior Sister, oh, I’m not looking at clouds! I’m checking the time!”

“Checking the time? Yuer, is there something urgent? There’s nothing left to do here, and I haven't tied you up with a rope, so you’re free to leave anytime!”

“…”

Seeing his third disciple dawdling with no intention to leave, the master raised an eyebrow in confusion, “Why aren’t you going? Didn’t you say you were in a hurry?”

“Well, um, it’s time, it’s time to…”

“Come on! What’s the time for? Just spit it out!”

In a moment of panic, Lin Yu closed his eyes and shouted, “It’s time to eat!”

“Pff…”

Gan Lanlan couldn’t hold back, realizing all this time he wanted her to check the time when he really meant to just eat. A watch would have sufficed!

Wen Gu and Wen Zhi both covered their faces with their fans and looked away, hiding their amusement; if only their smiles weren't so pronounced!

As for Master Qingyang, he was already fuming. He finally managed to set up a little test and got a student not only scoring full marks but also extra credit, and that little brat was only thinking about food?

“You little rascal! It’s one thing to mess around normally, but on such a joyous day, you’re only thinking about eating? And you’re someone who practices fasting! It truly infuriates me! If I don’t give you a good beating today, I won’t feel better!”

As he said this, he reached for the sugarcane to smack the lad…

He had been eyeing that sugarcane for a while, and it looked so tempting!

“Hey, Master, be careful not to hurt yourself! Let me chop it for you!”

“No need! I can do it myself!”

With that, he waved his hand, and a chunk of the sugarcane was gone in an instant!

“…”

Calm down. The master only took a little piece of the sugarcane; it wasn’t a big deal.

But still!

“Master, I’m still a mortal for the time being. It’s that time; my junior brother was indeed right, it’s time to eat!”

“Exactly, Master! If we don’t eat, my junior sister will definitely be hungry! … I’m just having a bit too!”

“... You ungrateful disciple!”

Just as it seemed a “master-disciple tragedy” was about to unfold, Gan Lanlan hurriedly stepped forward, “Master, we cooked some spiritual chicken soup today. Why don’t you join us for a meal?”

“Yes! Yes! Master, my junior sister cooks really well. Big Brother, Senior Sister, and I have been eating together every day now!”

Right! Ever since their first group meal, the entire discipleship had suddenly developed a love for dining together.

“You all…”

Seeing his eldest disciple gazing up at the clouds as if he was in meditation and the second disciple looking down at his sleeve as though it had flowers on it, the master couldn’t help but wonder about his two younger disciples’ gleaming eyes.

It was truly frustrating; here they were cultivating, yet all they could think about was eating!

*

Outside Gan Lanlan’s little kitchen, a dining hall had been newly built, complete with a new sign hanging overhead.

It read: **The Taste Seekers’ Pavilion**

A large round wooden table was set; it could easily seat not just the five disciples but even more if needed!

The table and the accompanying chairs were thoughtfully arranged by the eldest brother, both grand and beautiful. The first time Gan Lanlan saw it, she instantly fell in love.

She had only mentioned wanting a small glass turntable for when they couldn’t reach the dishes, and Lin Yu's eyes lit up.

“If we can spin it, I could snag more dishes!”

Before long, her eldest brother arranged for a glass turntable and somehow managed to procure a stack of glass bowls.

With all this, Gan Lanlan felt quite special!

Dinner preparations became an art form; the coarseness of their past lives during the apocalypse was in the past!

In the center of the table was a small glass vase, filled with fresh flowers replaced daily by Wen Zhi!

The entire dining area was set up by the group, practical yet warm, making even Master Qingyang nod in approval.

“This place is well decorated,” Master Qingyang stroked his beard, indicating his satisfaction!

Once the dishes were served…

“The spiritual rice is quite tender; I haven’t had this in centuries!”

“Right, Master!” Lin Yu was always the most supportive.

“This spiritual vegetable is fresh and crunchy…”

“Mm-hmm…” So delicious! You could never have too much—who had time to please the Master now!

“The braised pork on spiritual rice is simply exceptional!”

“Mmm…”

“This spiritual chicken soup is also good… I’ll have another bowl, please!”

“Of course, Master!”

Seeing how much everyone enjoyed her cooking made Gan Lanlan quite happy as she swiftly filled Master’s bowl!

“Junior Sister, save some for me! Don’t pour everything into Master’s bowl!”

Caught up in the moment, Lin Yu tried to sneak in some of his share; it wasn't easy securing his rations!

“Hey, you little rascal! I’m much older, so why shouldn’t I eat more?”

“Ah, Master, drink as you please! Enjoy as much as you want!”

Despite saying that, his face turned sour. If he’d known, he wouldn’t have let Master know they were eating every day!

Such a blunder!

“Don’t worry, Junior Brother; there’s plenty for everyone!”

Didn’t they notice the elder brother and sister silently munching away?

Fortunately, Gan Lanlan didn’t need to worry about chopping vegetables or washing dishes; her elder brothers and sisters could handle it all with their techniques, faster than any dishwasher or robotic vacuum.

All she needed to do was hold the ladle.

But truly, even the simplest dishes cooked here were incredibly delicious.

Watching her disciples interact harmoniously, with little words exchanged but clear camaraderie, filled her heart with warmth.

Every now and then, she would tease her third disciple; this life was pure bliss!

“This little disciple’s skills are indeed commendable.”

“Thank you for your praise, Master! We have three meals a day; if you’re here on the mountain, please join us!”

“Master~! With my junior sister’s skills, we can’t waste such opportunity, right? Besides, our discipleship dining together is harmonious and lively! Please say yes!”

In fear that Master would refuse, Lin Yu exerted every ounce of charm, nearly causing his Master to wobble!

“Let go, let go… Pulling like that, what's that about?”

After watching Lin Yu settle back down, Master finally said, “I never said I wouldn’t agree. Later, Yuer, you accompany me out for a bit.”

“Master, where are we going?”

“Going to find our clan leader for some rare spiritual food!”

Not just to fill their bellies, but to eat well. Precious ingredients must be arranged.

Lin Yu lit up with gratitude, “Yes, Master!”

“Hmm!”

Master Qingyang gave a reserved nod.

After finishing the meal, their footsteps grew quicker; his mind was already pondering, “The last time my brother went to the outside domain, it seems he found some new delicacies. I wonder how they taste. And the time before that…”

The trio of disciples looked at their departing Master and the eagerly following younger disciple, sharing a knowing smile.
