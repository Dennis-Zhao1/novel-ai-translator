**Crisis Approaches**

"Lanlan, there are three vehicles outside. They’re identified as malicious, armed with guns."  
"Oh? Finally, someone has come to stir up trouble after all this time? That’s good; everyone seems to have gotten a bit complacent lately—some people need a lesson! Come on, let's get a live broadcast started!"  

Seated in her significantly enlarged and more comfortable living room, Lanlan happily snacked on freshly picked fruit from the garden while closing the garden gate to avoid distractions.  
"Let's start the live stream!"  
That's right, the previous TV wall in the living room had transformed into a real-time broadcasting screen.  

With the overall upgrade of the room, all the facilities on Lanlan's side had seen enhancements as well.  
Don't ask how this was achieved; just know it was the system that did it, forcibly rewarding her with improvements to her home—she certainly couldn’t refuse!  

The camera shifted to the entrance of the base, where a guard pointed his gun and shouted,  
"Who goes there? Stop the vehicles and get out for inspection!"  
Good, good, the police were still quite responsible.  

A few burly men stepped out of the vehicle first, followed by a group of timid women who huddled together.  
The bald man stepped forward and offered a cigarette,  
"Hello, brother. We’ve been on the run and saw this place, which seems like a base. Can we rest here and get some supplies?"  

The guard assessed them—a mere dozen individuals—and reported through his walkie-talkie to those inside.  
"Okay, but the vehicles can only park in this area."  
"Alright, thank you, brother."  

Watching as they entered the front reception of the complex with guns slung over their shoulders, the guard subsequently reported the situation upstairs.  
"Is the base leader in? Let him come out; we need to discuss business."  
Having said that, the one-eyed man and his crew brazenly walked past the guard into the compound.  

"Hey, don't you think something seems off here?"  
The one-eyed man showed no reaction, while his companions were too nervous to speak.  

After a while, a middle-aged man, somewhat plump and exuding an air of authority, approached with a few aides.  
The two sides were at a standstill, each seemingly waiting for the other to make a sound first.  
Meanwhile, Lanlan, observing the standoff, found it amusing and giggled as she continued to eat.  

The bald man was the first to break the silence, "Hello, brothers..."  
"Please call me the base leader. I’m the general manager of XX Company from XX Town, and this base is under my jurisdiction now."  
"Oh? In that case, it seems like it’s time for a change in leadership."  

With that, a gun was aimed straight at the head of the plump man known as the base leader.  
Unwilling to back down, the leader's men quickly raised their weapons, leading to a tense standoff.  

*  
A heavy knock echoed at the gate of Lanlan's yard, and Guan Xin's voice rang out from outside,  
"Lan, there’s trouble! A group of people has come, and they don’t seem friendly. My dad has already gone over!"  
He rambled while walking,  
“I told you Wang Fatty wasn’t a good person, didn’t I? But you still let him develop the base. Now look where that’s got us; he even calls himself the base leader! Lan, sister, big brother, can you do something? It's like letting the bullets fly in a movie—this isn’t a film! You should stop just… eating!"  

Seeing the large-screen live stream and the fresh fruit on the table, he added,  
"Hey? So you knew all along, huh? Haha, save me some of that!"  

*  
When Guan He Ping arrived, he remembered Lanlan’s words and hid among the crowd without stepping forward.  
Inside, it was just the one-eyed man’s group insisting that Wang Fatty relinquish his title as the base leader for his own survival.   

Wang Fatty was desperate to recruit them but didn’t want to lose his leadership position. He believed their show of force was a sign of contempt towards him, prompting him to try to drive them away.  
A gunshot rang out.  

Lanlan’s expression turned serious as she halted her snacking.  
The one-eyed man, sensing that there were capable fighters on their side, didn't directly attack the base personnel.  
Instead, he spun around and shot one of the women they had brought along, killing her instantly.  
Wang Fatty had faced zombies before, but there had never been any killings in the Cane Base; he now broke out in a cold sweat.  

"Ha, Fatty, I’m not negotiating with you—I’m simply notifying you."  
Wang Fatty swallowed hard; fear gripped him, but he steeled himself at the thought of the many people behind him.  
"I’m not some soft target! You think we’re afraid of you? Get out of our base, now!"  

The one-eyed man narrowed his gaze,  
“Fatty, you’re brave. Let’s see how strong you are when… my little darlings come out!"  

Due to routine cleanups near the base, zombies had rarely appeared recently; yet suddenly, hordes surged forth from all directions, encircling the large base.  
These zombies, appearing dusty and as if they had just crawled out from the soil, could it be that they’ve “turned into earth-dwellers"?  

The one-eyed man tossed the dead woman into the zombie horde like a piece of trash.  
Those watching from the base felt the tension grow, shifting into combat mode.  
Seeing these actions, Guan He Ping, hidden in the crowd, wore a deep frown.  

*  
“What the hell! This bastard just killed someone; I need to kill this scum!”  
He burst forth like a gust of wind.  
Lanlan pressed her earpiece, “Uncle Guan, hold on. Try to protect those women. You don’t need to worry about me; let the base people see what sort of world we live in now!”  

In truth, Lanlan hadn’t anticipated that the opposing side would suddenly open fire indiscriminately.  
As Guan Xin had said, life had been tough during the apocalypse, and while there were certainly conflicts and struggles for power, there had yet to be anyone in the Cane Base who disregarded human life.  

Watching the screen filled with ruthless individuals hoisting their guns and laughing hysterically, unbothered by the trembling, weak women beneath them,  
Lanlan took a deep breath; perhaps she had overestimated the savagery of this chaotic world.  

*  
The bald man, acting as their spokesperson, shifted from his previous timid demeanor and fiercely threatened the base.  
“Be smart, hand over the base, and you can live. Otherwise—hmm. See these women? They’re just a preview of your fate.”  
He mocked Wang Fatty as well,  
"Fatty, you certainly have a lot of meat. It should be enough for a meal. Hahaha."  

While Wang Fatty had some powers, he was, to be honest, not a good person but still human.  
"You… you guys actually kill people without a second thought?"  
“Ha, do you think this is still a peaceful era? We don’t just kill—we eat them too! What kind of show of force are you putting on before us? Bah! Base Leader? Look at these zombies; they’re all soldiers of my big brother. With a command from him, we could wipe your entire base off the map!”  

He gestured as if to demonstrate sweeping the place away, full of arrogance.  
“Look at these women—old, weak, and children—we don’t have enough food for ourselves. What else can we eat if not them? At this rate, I could devour half of one in a meal.”  

As the crowd went pale from fear, the bald man felt even prouder.  
“Afraid, are you? Truth be told, we’ve been watching your base for a long time now. With those few guns, you’ll never break through my brother’s fortress. My brother is a level 3 ability user, and we’re all level 2. You little guys are no match for us!”  

He continued,  
“Do you know what happened to the last base that dared to resist my brother? They were much bigger than yours! And what happened? My boss just had to speak, and they were wiped out! You see these few ladies trembling over there? That’s all that’s left, awaiting to be stored as our food.”  

Pointing towards the shivering, dull-eyed women,  
“If it weren’t for my boss taking a liking to your base, we’d have stomped it flat long ago. Do you get it? Wise up and surrender!”  

The one-eyed man raised a hand, halting the bald man from speaking further.  
“I’ve changed my mind!”  
“You look quite meaty and delicious!”  

Wang Fatty was already so scared he couldn’t think straight, his mind looping, "meaty and delicious, meaty and delicious…"  
The words echoed in his head like a nightmare!  
"Bang!"
