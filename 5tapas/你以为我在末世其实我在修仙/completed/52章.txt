### Setting Out from the Mountain

"This journey has been more thrilling than dangerous, but next time, don’t be too reckless. Safety comes first."

As they felt the seriousness in Master Qiyang's gaze, several disciples quickly nodded in agreement.

"Master, now that everything's handled here, can I go check out Monster Village?"

After considering for a moment, Master Qiyang agreed, realizing that his disciples were not weak and the place wasn’t a perilous secret realm. 

"Very well! It's good for you all to experience some training together."

Watching his older brothers and sisters turn to gather their things, Gan Lianlan tried to speak but was too late.

Never mind, never mind. They're not ordinary people; even if they do encounter zombies, they should be able to handle it… right?

With Wei Baocun in tow, the five set out on their journey down the mountain! Their destination: Monster Village.

However, there were interesting bits to this descent.

"Little Junior Sister, bring more clothes and snacks with you. Big Senior Brother has a carriage where we can store everything."

"Big Senior Brother, why not just use the storage ring? Why go through all this trouble?"

"You don't understand!" he replied smugly, his tone self-satisfied.

With a resounding thump, Lin Yu's older brother tapped him on the head.

"Mind your manners when talking to your junior sister."

Rubbing the back of his head in grievance, Lin Yu could only mumble, "Okay."

"Ahem, little junior sister, you might not know this, but as cultivators going down the mountain for training, we actually face restrictions. For instance, if we go into certain secret realms, we can manage, but if we head to places densely populated with ordinary people, we can't use many of our spells."

As he spoke, he was busy packing various spiritual rice, herbs, and delicacies; after all, he was determined to bring along some good food. He had missed out on too much before!

"Restrictions? What kind of restrictions?"

"Which restrictions we face depends on the situation in each place. I previously heard from my seniors that in serious cases, we can’t use spells at all, so cultivators are only marginally stronger than ordinary people!"

"I even heard that a sword-obsessed disciple from Sword Sect once encountered a very skilled ordinary person and lost! He kept provoking him afterward, and now he’s still stuck there! So, even as cultivators, we must be careful when we step outside."

Seeing the little junior sister furrow her brows, he quickly added, "But you don't have to worry. Down the mountain is actually quite fun..."

Spotting the kind expression on his senior brother's face, the conversation shifted.

"Ahem, as long as we don't cause trouble, we should be fine! Our sect has emergency return talismans; they’re treasures that can bring us back to the sect no matter where we are. So don’t be afraid!"

Just then, Wen Zhi walked in, having packed some tools for making snacks as well.

"Yes, little junior sister, don’t worry! Although there will be some restrictions, the place we are heading to doesn’t have too many."

"How do you know, Senior Sister?"

Wen Zhi smirked slightly, glancing at a certain person who was diligently organizing books, and replied, "Your big senior brother has already got the details."

Gan Lianlan was taken aback, looking at that senior brother with his back to them who seemed focused on his task, feeling a warm gratitude swell within her.

Honestly, up to this point, Gan Lianlan felt rather surreal about everything—like she had been in a dream. If it weren’t for the recent appearance of Sisi, she might have continued in a state of aimlessness.

However, it seemed that Sisi had overexerted her energy and was currently fast asleep in the spiritual beast space!

Feeling the unspoken concern from her seniors, Gan Lianlan felt deeply moved.

"Thank you, Big Senior Brother."

"We're family, there's no need for thanks!"

"Brothers of Baocun, what are you waiting for? Come on up!"

Wei Baocun hesitated with his little backpack, looking nervously at Lin Yu and the carriage, not daring to step onto the sleek, clean vehicle.

"Master, I think I'll just walk behind the carriage."

With one foot dangling down and the other stepping onto the carriage, Lin Yu held the reins confidently, looking the part of a driver.

"Hey, just call me Mr. Lin, no need for 'Master.' Now get in!"

After all, he was at an age where calling him a 'Master' was a bit embarrassing.

Gan Lianlan pulled back the carriage curtain and encouraged him, "Baocun, come on up! This carriage has automatic cleaning features, so you don’t need to worry."

Hearing this, Wei Baocun finally mustered the courage to climb aboard, his face a mix of shyness and excitement. He thought to himself, although he couldn't enter the sect, sitting in the same carriage as masters was enough to impress the village chief when he returned!

The carriage was no ordinary vehicle—though it looked like a standard-sized carriage from outside, inside was a different world. 

It was said to be invented by predecessors for training adventures; the curtains hiding the vast space. Inside was a small tea room, resembling the layout of the Wan Zhi Mountain, clearly the handiwork of the big senior brother, who had a penchant for such designs.

This kind of carriage was quite popular but also... a bit pricey!

However, for these "second-generation immortals," it wasn’t an issue!

“Mr. Lin, don’t the horses need to eat grass and rest? They have been running for a while.”

“Hahaha, this isn’t a real horse; it merely looks similar! It runs on spirit stones and can travel thousands of miles a day, much more convenient than ordinary horses.”

“Oh, no wonder! This is an immortal horse!”

“Immortal horse? Hahaha, if you want to call it that, go ahead.”

“By the way, Mr. Lin, how did you know the direction to our village?”

“Well, masters have their own clever methods!”

“Ohhh~”

No doubt, Wei Baocun was envious of the immortals!

Unfortunately, he couldn't join the sect and fulfill his promise to the village chief. Yet, he thought, if these masters could help solve issues for his village, then this journey would be worthwhile.

“However, we can only have a general idea of the direction. Once we arrive, we’ll still need you to show us the way.”

“No problem, Mr. Lin! I definitely know the way back home!”

After thinking for a moment and scratching his head, he added, “But the mountain paths are narrow; the carriage might not fit.”

“No worries, the carriage is just a means of transportation. We will have to get out anyway. If we stay inside the whole time, it wouldn’t count as training! Back when I was training with the sect, I once ran for a whole month without stopping!”

After all, being chased by a beast for a month with his powers restricted meant he had to run fast, or he would end up as lunch!

Wei Baocun was shocked! Running for a whole month?!

“Masters still have to run? I thought masters fly everywhere… like that one flying in the sky!”

As he said this, he pointed ahead!

“Which one?”

Lin Yu was also curious. Within a restricted area, someone was daring enough to fly? Didn't they fear consequences?

Looking at the figure perched on top of a tree, Lin Yu noted, “That person looks somewhat familiar!”

Upon stepping outside the sect, Gan Lianlan was more inclined to enjoy the sights and sounds. Unlike the Wen siblings, who spent their days reading, writing, painting, or playing instruments, she felt there was a certain… dullness to it!

At that moment, Lin Yu turned to Gan Lianlan, making expressions of intrigue:
"Little Junior Sister, do you understand how I feel now?"

Gan Lianlan: "I completely understand and share your sentiment!"

Indeed, this was the lifestyle fitting a “three-hundred-year-old elder!”

In any case, Gan Lianlan now fully comprehended why Lin Yu had been so excited when she had come up the mountain!

Unable to stand the atmosphere in the carriage any longer, Gan Lianlan quickly poked her head out, asking, “Big Senior Brother, who do you think looks familiar?”

“Little Junior Sister, you’re out! We were talking about that figure, the one there, perched atop the tree! Don’t you think that silhouette looks a bit familiar?”

At a glance, Gan Lianlan couldn’t help but twitch her lips; how could that silhouette not look familiar?

“Hmm, familiar~”

“Right? I just can’t recall who it is… Who is it again?”

“Hehe, we just saw them not long ago!”

“Saw them? How come I can’t remember!”

As the carriage drew closer, it seemed the person was either waiting for someone or… surveying the area? 

In any case, they remained high in the tree and didn’t move!

Gan Lianlan thought: despite being an elder of the sect, it’s still good etiquette to pay respects at least—better to greet them and move on.

So she pulled her little senior brother and hurriedly got down from the carriage! 

Witnessing the masters disembark, Wei Baocun quickly followed suit.

He was perceptive enough for this situation!

As for the seniors still in the carriage… well, they would have to be dealt with later!
