### Doctor Hua's Family 

In the yard of Lanlan Gan's house, a small electric tricycle, with its nimble form, became the primary vehicle for transporting goods. 

As Doctor Hua arrived with his family, he quickly counted the members: his parents, his wife—it seemed they would need at least two rooms. 

“Lan, would it be possible for me to rent all four rooms?” 

“All four? Sure, Doctor Hua, but are there more people coming from your side?” 

“Not really. My son is away and I haven't been able to reach him. I just hope he's doing okay.” 

As he mentioned his son, a hint of worry creased Doctor Hua's brow. Nevertheless, he was a seasoned individual who had faced many storms in life; he understood that his child needed to find his own path, and all he could do was wait at home. Plus, going out in search of him without any means of contact could complicate things further. 

“To be honest, the main reason I need the space is all these herbs and precious family heirlooms!” He gently patted the items on the tricycle, his eyes filled with nostalgia. 

Though covered by a waterproof tarp, the contents were surely treasures. 

“I understand that in a safe place like this, space might be running low, but... I just can't bear the thought of letting these things be buried away! Lan, I'm begging you, could you please allow me to rent a couple of extra rooms? I just need somewhere to store them.” 

Doctor Hua's father, the elderly doctor, interjected anxiously, “Right, Lan, we can all squeeze into a couple of rooms, and these items are part of our cultural heritage... we can't just abandon them.” 

Lanlan observed the silver-haired Hua family, their faces full of affection as they caressed the ancient books and medical texts atop the tricycle. In the chaos of disaster, their careful handling had still resulted in considerable damage to many items. 

Lanlan noticed that their first load was not filled with basic necessities or food, but rather these precious artifacts that would be disregarded as scrap metal in a time of turmoil. Their goal was simple: they just wanted a safe place to protect these treasures. 

Despite their white hair and shaky movements, their desire to protect these possessions was commendable. Lanlan Gan felt a profound respect for Doctor Hua’s family. 

It was clear that they had been skeptical about the safety of this place before, and would likely not have come without Uncle Guan’s urging and assurances. If it weren’t for Doctor Hua’s firsthand experience, they might still be doubtful!

Thinking for a moment, Lanlan posed a question, “Doctor Hua, I’d like to invite you to be the community physician; please don’t refuse just yet! While I call this a community, it really lacks personnel and is in urgent need of talented people like yourselves. I would like to offer you the opportunity to live here rent-free and store your supplies—consider it an employee benefit. What do you think?” 

“Uh...” 

They were quite tempted but felt guilty about lowering themselves to such conditions. Yet, the offer was hard to refuse! 

Doctor Hua exchanged glances with his family; for the sake of their invaluable possessions... 

“I accept. It’s actually within our old profession. However, even though we are older, we can still work. If you have any need for us, Lan, just let us know.” 

“Then welcome, Doctor Hua, as our official community employee! You can have two rooms, and let’s consider them your pharmacy! As for your day-to-day duties as the community physician... well, I have no experience, so you can decide how to manage it.” 

Feeling a bit embarrassed, she scratched her head; she truly seemed inexperienced. 

“Additionally, we’ll have a storage building constructed soon behind your house for your supplies, and we can set up a second floor for more comfortable living arrangements. As for salary...” 

“No, no, we don’t need a salary...” 

“Not taking a salary isn’t an option! As you can see, life in the community will require energy points. We need some form of income! Don’t worry, this will be directly deposited into your account; there’s no need to decline.” 

【Lanlan, a small wave of zombies is approaching!】 

Before they could respond further, Lanlan quickly waved her hand, gesturing for silence, and turned to scan the area. 

Perhaps due to the increased number of newcomers, their scent had attracted nearby monsters. Clearly, these creatures were much faster than before; as Guan Xin had indicated, the monsters were evolving! 

Doctor Hua and his family took a step back, supporting each other as they created distance. 

Guan Xin on the roof had also noticed the anomaly: 
“Whoa, Lan, there are a lot of zombies gathering around!” 

“I see them! Doctor Hua, can you help me push the tricycle to that clear spot? Xiao Guan, take them inside. Quick!” 

Guan Xin hurriedly ushered the elderly couple and Mrs. Hua into their home. 

Lanlan assessed the speed of the approaching monsters and realized they had a bit of time. She hurriedly worked alongside Doctor Hua to push the tricycle to a designated safe area... 

Ultimately, securing supplies within their own territory equated to safety. 

Dragging the reluctant Doctor Hua into her home, he expressed his desire to push the vehicle again. The lack of any barriers left him feeling troubled... 

“Doctor Hua, please, let’s go inside! It’s still safe to leave the things here; don’t worry!” 

Through the window, they observed the monsters drawing ever closer to the tricycle. Had it not been for Lanlan's pulling, Doctor Hua might have dashed out impulsively. 

“Doctor Hua, stay calm. The inside of the house can mask human scent. Without any human aura, they’ll quickly lose interest; these undead have no attraction to lifeless objects.” 

As the zombies stumbled forward, the tension rose among the gathered people. After all, the Hua family had witnessed patients morph into monsters and attack their loved ones firsthand... 

If it weren’t for Guan He Ping's help earlier, they wouldn’t have made it here safely. 

The zombies soon noticed they could no longer press forward, resigning to stand in place and hiss. 

Lanlan noticed their halt was due to reaching the edge of the floor! 

【Sisi, it seems like the floor can also deter zombies.】 

【Yes! But it’s still not as safe as being inside the house, so Lanlan should work on building more rooms.】 

【Absolutely! Whether it’s constructing houses or laying roads, expanding comprehensively is definitely the way to go!】 

Realizing they no longer sensed human presence, the zombies began to disperse, and everyone exhaled in relief. 

They also came to appreciate just how miraculous this modular home truly was! 

As the zombies retreated, everyone quickly resumed their chores: packing away items and constructing homes. However, they remained vigilant, remaining aware of their surroundings... 

Except for Lanlan, who felt carefree because she had Sisi! 

Guan He Ping had returned several times, bringing back useful supplies. After all, the young landlady, Lanlan, had specifically requested living things—be it plants, animals, or seeds, to welcome them with open arms. 

As for new tenants, none had come yet, as many townsfolk were still skeptical or waiting for rescue. 

Of course, if Doctor Hua’s family weren't seeking shelter for their precious items, they likely wouldn’t be here either! 

Guan Xin, newly empowered by his spatial abilities, insisted on venturing outside to gather more supplies, riding high on excitement. 

He believed that equipped with his newfound space, he could collect significantly more. 

As for Lanlan, Sisi had advised:
【If Lanlan leaves, without the central energy anchoring, the defense would gradually weaken!】 

【In other words, I’m essentially the central power generator!】 

【Exactly!】 

【......】 

As night fell further, Guan He Ping returned, covered in dirt, cradling a fainted child. Guan Xin followed closely behind, looking pale, and as soon as they returned, he collapsed onto the ground, hugging his head. 

“What happened?” 

“We encountered a man-eating monster.” 

“......And this child?” 

“This child’s parents were caught up in the chaos, leaving him in shock. Their family was likely preparing to flee town when they stumbled into the zombies. Unfortunately, we only managed to save this child... By the way, more people might come tomorrow.” 

Lanlan nodded, understanding this was inevitable. 

Mrs. Hua rushed forward to take the child into her arms, exclaiming, “Oh, this poor child! Give him to me; you two big men clearly can’t manage. Go wash up, change your clothes, and eat something. You’ll be dining at Lanlan’s tonight.” 

Lanlan had intended to suggest they bathe in her house but hadn’t gotten the chance before Guan He Ping whisked Guan Xin inside, as they had stored a large box of clean water. 

To enjoy a decent meal without zombie interruptions, they all agreed to have dinner at Lanlan's. 

Looking at the cozy, bright little house, everyone maintained a silent understanding; no questions needed to be asked. 

Although it was a bit cramped, this was the best, most secure meal they had shared in days, and certainly the quietest one too. 

Finally, it was Lanlan who broke the silence, “Uncle Guan, I’d like to gradually extend the foundation towards the town. Please stay to help us build houses; having you here ensures our safety.” 

Everyone could see that Guan He Ping was still fixated on the outside world. 

However, he self-deprecatingly admitted, “Truth be told, I can't be of much help out there…” 

He recalled the peculiar expressions from others when they saw him and how someone had even pushed him in front of a monster during a fight. If Guan Xin hadn’t been nearby, he might not have made it back… 

Even though he possessed that capability, such actions were truly hard to accept! 

At that moment, Guan Xin, now coming back to himself, urged, “Dad, stay here and help us build more homes. They won’t trust you if you go out there; let’s finish this here. Besides, it’s not safe. You’ll be able to relax when you’re with us.” 

At least he wouldn’t risk being shoved out as a scapegoat. 

Seeing his son’s rare seriousness and concern, Guan He Ping finally nodded. 

“Alright, after dinner, let’s get to work.” 

“Old Guan, I’ll pitch in as well.” 

Doctor Hua and his family understood the urgency; supplies could be gathered over time, but constructing a secure base was pressing. 

Working outside did indeed attract zombies. 

Nonetheless, with Guan He Ping’s fighting capabilities, everyone felt considerably more at ease. 

Plus, every now and then, the sound of a thwack echoed through the air as they caught sight of little Lanlan expertly hitting targets with her baseball bat, prompting knowing smiles amongst them. 

At the very least, everyone was putting in effort, and they could still see a glimmer of hope. 

As night deepened over this desolate land, the light of the stars began to enlarge and spread... 

One could believe that, someday, the darkness would be driven away, illuminating the vast earth.
