**The True Apocalypse Approaches**

Daylight grows ever shorter, while nights stretch endlessly, a bitter cold relentlessly invades humanity's living spaces, challenging even the air itself! 

In the conference room of the Sugarcane Base, Lanlan Gan and her team are engaged in an online meeting with the headquarters of Huaguo and existing global bases. 

Dr. Zhong appears on the screen, looking increasingly emaciated. Despite his efforts to hide it, Lanlan can see the exhaustion in his eyes. She knows that over the years, both physically and mentally, Dr. Zhong has been overloaded...

An unparalleled hero!

The spokesperson for the United Nations states, “The current situation is evident to all: the world may be entering another ice age. We can still fight against the zombies; however, the drastic deterioration of natural conditions leaves us powerless!”

The representatives from Base X respond, “Indeed, humanity has caused irreparable harm to nature. Despite our prolonged search, we have yet to find a suitable place for future human habitation.”

The spokesperson for Base Y adds, “Our country's populace is primarily concentrated in Base Y! Even now, our population is less than one ten-thousandth of what it once was, and we are desperately short on food and supplies. The agricultural systems we had been researching have collapsed due to the sudden environmental changes. We don’t know what to do!”

Base G chimes in, “Yes, our food reserves are running low. The apocalypse is unfolding too rapidly, leaving no opportunity for humanity to survive!”

...

Leaders from bases around the world participated in this meeting, but after a round of discussions, instead of solving the problem, it seems they have only raised more questions!

Wells, the leader from M Country, frowns, lost in thought. However, Lanlan observes that there is no panic in his eyes, which suggests he might still have a trump card up his sleeve.

In the end, the meeting establishes three main directions:
1. To secure the safety of the surviving humans as much as possible, all bases will enter a heightened state of alert.
2. Resource sharing is critical; currently, all bases are facing a shortage of resources. We must unite and cooperate to survive long-term.
3. Continue searching for new environments suitable for human habitation, whether on Earth or in outer space.

By the time the meeting adjourns, there are still no practical solutions in sight. From Lanlan’s perspective, it all boils down to one thing: 
Self-rescue!

The Sugarcane Base has already entered a state of preparation for battle. Even the most mischievous children are now staying home to help with tasks within their capacity or quietly keeping to their own spaces, a stark contrast to their previous exuberance.

Captain Hua, the base's highest military leader and personal security chief, stands behind her. 

From the lofty tower at the center of the Sugarcane Base, they can see waves of survivors arriving from nearby bases, responding to broadcasts urging them to seek refuge in the larger bases to ensure their survival.

Some come out with a dare-to-hope attitude, while others choose to stay in familiar surroundings; some suffer losses on the way, while others reach the new base by sheer luck...

Though the Sugarcane Base has been expanding underground, it can’t accommodate so many people all at once, but for now, everyone is still able to live above ground.

Lanlan furrows her brow; with conditions already deteriorating, wouldn’t a new ice age mean the end of humanity?

Watching the crowd, Captain Hua murmurs, “In this world, is there still hope for humanity?” It’s unclear if he’s asking himself or the others!

“There is, there will definitely be a way,” Lanlan replies with conviction. Perhaps this is the purpose of their existence as dictated by the system?

Looking at the girl beside him, who has visibly lost weight, Hua's focus is intense, yet his furrowed brows betray his worry and concern.

All he can do now is protect her!

Often, people feel lost, but when disaster strikes, there are always those who stand at the forefront, leading others forward. With direction and a common goal, they become more united.

They fear no hardship and charge ahead, as such individuals are essential creators and leaders of historical progress.

The Sugarcane Base is exceptionally busy, with everyone working hard. 

While the day tempers the cold, they push for food production and the construction of more living spaces... 

They withstand the wind and snow, unwilling to pause in their labors, for they fear that stopping means there will be no future!

When exhausted, they rest in the newly established temporary medical facility. Built by the base leader, the facility is equipped with a heating system unique to the Sugarcane Base. Many heating systems can no longer withstand the biting cold!

After replenishing their energy, they return to work.

As natural conditions continue to worsen, they worry that even this miraculous heating system won't last much longer.

Suddenly, a “crack, crack, crack” resonates!

The base personnel notice that the white walls, which the Base Leader had instructed to be built on the outer perimeter, suddenly begin to extend upwards autonomously...

After a period of time, these walls slowly take the shape of a half-circle, resembling a protective shell that encompasses the entire Sugarcane Base.

Within this massive shell, they can see the outside through the white “eggshell,” while it effectively isolates them from the harsh weather.

Their bodies, previously frozen, slowly begin to warm up, as if stepping into a heated room in the dead of winter.

On the innermost edge of the shell, a one-meter-wide planting area is established, serving as the strongest line of defense!

Many have heard through the new communication network that foreign large bases possess their own transparent protective shields; they are undoubtedly high-tech.

Sugarcane Base had never had such a shield since its founding was purely based on the manual labor of its inhabitants.

To their surprise, their leader has successfully obtained such advanced technology!

“Hello, residents of Sugarcane Base! I am your leader, Lanlan Gan!”

“The highest protection system has now been activated!”

“There is one day left. We will conduct a complete lockdown of the base, and entry and exit will be restricted. Please follow the arrangements and move to the underground safe spaces as soon as possible!”

“Because we are about to welcome the true apocalypse!”
