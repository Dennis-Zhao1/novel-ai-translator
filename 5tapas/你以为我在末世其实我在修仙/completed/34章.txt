**Chapter One: Old Companion**

Although it wasn't a complete piece, the segment of the purple plant in Gan Lanyan's hand was something she was all too familiar with. This was an old companion she had battled alongside during the apocalypse!

She never expected to see it here, making her question whether the apocalypse was real or just an illusion.

“Sugarcane.”

Hearing Gan Lanyan's confident tone piqued the interest of the knowledgeable senior brother, Wen Gu.

“Junior sister knows?”

“Yeah, this is called sugarcane. If you remove the outer layer, it can be eaten, and it tastes sweet. Furthermore, it can be used to make sugar.”

Of course, more importantly, during the apocalypse, it had been an incredible weapon. The entire Sugarcane Base relied on its energy transmission.

Wait, that’s not right. This is the sugarcane from the trial.

This piece of sugarcane should... probably just be regular sugarcane!

“Can you eat it? Let me try~” 

Gan Lanyan handed the sugarcane to her curious junior brother, Lin Yu. 

“You need to peel it, or if you don't mind, you can just chew on it like I do,” she suggested, energetically creating another piece of sugarcane, roughly the same size as the first one.

Then she started peeling and biting into it, and to her surprise, it was incredibly sweet.

“Just a bit of a test for your teeth. After chewing out the moisture, you’ll need to spit out the leftover pulp.”

Lin Yu, being a curious fellow, tried to mimic Gan Lanyan but found it a little awkward as he chewed on the sugarcane skin.

Though he wasn't used to it, the sweetness completely conquered his taste buds, and he took a big bite. 

“It’s really sweet! Senior brother and sister, want to give it a try too?”

Before they could respond, Gan Lanyan already handed each of them a piece. The two had no choice but to take it.

However, unlike Lin Yu, they didn’t just bite right into it. Using a hand sign, they made the sugarcane float in mid-air.

With a casual wave of Wen Gu's hand, the sugarcane transformed into neatly cut pieces!

Wen Zhi had taken out an exquisite glass dish, beautifully arranging the circular slices of sugarcane on it.

They picked up chopsticks, elegantly grabbing a small piece...

Yes, chopsticks were a must; one must always be graceful!

“How is it?”

“Very good! It seems... there's even a hint of spiritual energy in it!”

“Really? As expected of the senior brother; I didn't sense anything! I just thought it was sweet and quite tasty.”

Wen Gu looked at Gan Lanyan, who had managed to produce so much sugarcane in her first experience, and asked, “Junior sister, have you practiced any techniques before?”

Gan Lanyan was taken aback. “No, I haven’t.”

After all, whether in her past life or this one, there had never been anything like cultivating immortality; they were all atheists.

The only thing related to spiritual energy could probably be the natural life force that erupted during the apocalypse!

“Then, junior sister, do you feel any depletion of spiritual energy?”

“Nope, I don’t feel anything.”

“Oh?”

Even Lin Yu paused from biting the sugarcane, concerned as he asked, “Junior sister, are you really not feeling anything? I remember when Master tested me, I barely condensed a small chrysanthemum, and I was already exhausted. Junior sister, you’ve condensed what? Four of these?”

“But I don’t feel tired,” she insisted.

In fact, she thought she could handle another bundle without an issue.

“Maybe the junior sister has exceptional talent.”

Wen Zhi smiled affectionately as he tousled Gan Lanyan’s hair, feeling a sense of pride.

“That’s wonderful! Hahaha, I’m going to find Haozi. Hmph, always bragging about having an exceptionally talented sword-wielding junior sister, as if no one else has a junior sister!”

Without waiting for everyone’s reaction, Lin Yu dashed away... flying on his sword!

He didn’t forget to take a few more bites of sugarcane along the way, clearly enjoying it!

“Hey? Lin Yu, that unfortunate kid~ Forget it; every time we argue, we can’t win or fight him, and he always goes to bother Xiao Hao.”

“They must have a really good relationship!”

“They’ve fought since they were young; they can’t win, yet still love to provoke each other! Forget it. Junior sister, are you sure you feel no discomfort?”

“Nope!”

As she spoke, she conjured up another piece of sugarcane with a hand gesture.

“Senior sister, did you guys also condense like this before? What was it like? Was it also something tangible?”

Gan Lanyan was quite curious.

Recalling something amusing, Wen Zhi smiled and said, “Oh, that was more than three hundred years ago!”

“Three hundred years?”

“Yeah, your senior brother and I are over three hundred years old, and Lin Yu is still young; he’s only about two hundred! To us, you seem like a little child!”

“Haha, hee hee~”

What else could she say but a dry chuckle? In the realm of immortality, age was nothing!

“Speaking of my younger days, I was around ten years old back then! I went to the plum grove with my father, mother, and brother to enjoy the snow.”

As if reminiscing about a beautiful memory, Wen Zhi's smile softened even more.

“Back then, I thought the plums were beautiful. Without realizing, I condensed a small plum blossom. Being young, I didn’t think of it as a natural force; I just found it interesting. Then a wind blew, and that small plum flower merged into the sea of blossoms around me.”

He took Gan Lanyan's hand and started walking back, as today’s lessons were mostly over, and it wasn’t necessary for the child to bask in the sun outside.

As for Wen Gu, he naturally followed behind.

“Later, I went to ask my parents for help to find the flower, only to discover that I had condensed a small plum blossom infused with natural energy. Upon learning this, my father insisted on searching through the entire plum grove, but that blossom looked just like any other, and he still wouldn’t give up!”

“What happened then?”

“There was quite an uproar, and just so happened that Master passed by and recognized my talent. It was Master who helped me find that plum blossom.”

At this point, Wen Gu chuckled softly.

Being close siblings, he was well aware of the matter back then. 

He added, “Later, my father found a treasure box specifically to keep that plum blossom in his collection.”

“Uncle sounds quite lovely!”

She herself loved her parents dearly, but unfortunately... they had become separated!

“Lovely? That word... is fitting when directed at Zhi Zhi.”

“And what about you, senior brother?”

“Me!” with a flick of his sleeve.

“Then it seems no one loved me or cared for me!”

“Brother! You always talk nonsense! Clearly, it was your exceptional talent that Master valued; you simply wanted to protect me, which is why you came with me.”

“That’s really nice! So how did senior brother become a disciple?”

“Well, when my parents brought me to pay respects to Master, he casually suggested that I try it as well. I gave it a shot and condensed this little thing, which ended up being kept by me.”

As he spoke, a small orchid appeared in his hand.

“A gentleman like an orchid; this flower suits the senior brother very well.”

Indeed, who would have thought that the senior brother also had a mischievous side?

Wen Zhi rolled his eyes at her brother's pitiful act, unable to bear to look. But seeing the worry lift from her brow, she refrained from exposing him.

It was evident from the way the junior sister arrived that her family situation was likely challenging.

In the future, she’d have to look out for her more!

“Let’s go; senior sister will take us to eat! You’re not in a period of fasting, so you must be quite hungry by now.”

“Mm-hmm.”

The entire sect was quite affectionate and harmonious!

The master was noble and upright, the senior brother was humorous, the junior brother was amusing, and the senior sister prepared delicious... food?

Gazing at the exquisite glass platter before her, Gan Lanyan fell into deep thought...
