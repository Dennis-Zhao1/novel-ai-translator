**Infinite Sovereign, what a treasure this is!**

Fortunately, in the following days, nothing major occurred—just senior brothers and sisters taking her to explore the mountain and meet friends! It was like starting a new job; you first need to familiarize yourself with different departments, right? When something comes up, you'll know which department to go to and who to approach.

As for cultivation, they were still at the stage of simple theoretical knowledge. For practical training, it would require the guidance of their master, lest he lead his little junior sister astray. 

After a long wait, Master Qingyang finally returned. He mentioned that sugarcane was a new species he had never seen before, and he took a few stalks to munch on... cough, cough, to research!

Plus, his little disciple was engaging with cultivation for the first time and her spiritual energy was abundant! It was akin to a preschool student effortlessly tossing around addition and subtraction; as a teacher, he couldn't let his student’s talents go to waste. His little apprentice’s potential made him feel as if he had found a treasure!

Though it was rare for Wanzhi Mountain to admit new disciples in centuries, perhaps they had stumbled upon a true genius!

**At the Flower Garden, by the Bamboo Grove!**

In a familiar setting, it was just a few people from the sect, but this time Master Qingyang was also present. 

"Did you understand the essentials of the technique I just mentioned, Lian'er?" 

"Yes, Master. I understand." 

Master Qingyang stroked his beard, signaling that Lian Lian could begin. 

To explain the essentials of the technique, Lian Lian realized it was quite similar to using her abilities during trials in the apocalypse. With even more abundant spiritual energy in the cultivation world, she was eager to witness the effects of her technique! 

Master Qingyang and the others stepped back a few paces to leave space for Lian Lian. 

Standing in the clearing of the bamboo grove, under the watchful eyes of her seniors, she waved her hand, and a field of sugarcane appeared. These sugarcane plants seemed to reflect the habits of the apocalypse, creating a protective barrier around the bamboo grove. 

Initially, Lian Lian thought it would be at most a dozen meters, but to her surprise, it encompassed the entire bamboo grove! Indeed, a place rich in spiritual energy was wonderful! 

Looking at her master and seniors, she signaled with a smile: 
"I'm ready!"

Master Qingyang stared at Lian Lian without blinking, asking, 
"Is it starting? Oh, is it over already?"

“Uh... what?”

To create such a vast field of sugarcane in an instant, this little apprentice truly was a treasure! 

A natural purple barrier formed along the edge of the bamboo grove, with purple and green reflecting off each other, creating a unique sight. 

“Wow, I told you my little junior sister had outstanding talent! It took me a whole year to grow a field!” exclaimed Lin Yu in amazement.

Wen Zhi recalled the difficulty she faced at first with even a tiny plum tree; she gradually became more proficient. 
"Indeed, I have been practicing the natural forces since childhood. Initially, I couldn’t do it so easily!"

Wen Gu felt both gratified and melancholic, 
"It seems we need to work harder; otherwise, our little junior sister will soon catch up to us!" 

Once upon a time, they were the pride of the heavens, but now they realized there were talented individuals beyond their own ranks! Additionally, Lian Lian appeared so relaxed!

But, Infinite Sovereign, what a treasure this was! Who would dare to look down on Wanzhi Mountain again, thinking they only grew trees?

Clearly, they had no idea what Lian Lian had gone through in the trials; she was once the head of an entire base. Now, managing just this small bamboo grove was indeed an easy feat for her.

Master Qingyang couldn’t help but excitedly ask,
“Lian'er, have you really never encountered spiritual energy before?”

“No!” 

In modern times, spiritual energy was nonexistent, and the apocalypse wasn’t about spiritual energy—if anything, it could only be considered a trial, a fleeting dream! 

“Great! Great! Great!” 

He repeated the word thrice, showing how genuinely happy Master Qingyang was! 

After all, they truly lived in a "wide land with few people." Though all his disciples had skills, the lack of numbers was a hindrance! Each was a precious seedling!

For many years, no new disciples had joined, while the other sects, particularly those of the wood element, were expanding; during the Great Competition, they always exhibited their superiority with numbers, which was infuriating.

It's worth mentioning that the life element was essentially branched from the wood element, forming a newer, smaller sect. 

Master Qingyang believed his own sect was stronger, given that natural plants possessed unique abilities, which not everyone could attain! 

But the other sect’s deep heritage was not something Wanzhi Mountain’s few young practitioners could match! Their children lost out in years and experience. 

Every time the Grand Competition occurred, only the eldest disciple managed to secure a place in the top ten, which was already quite an achievement. 

To think a young lad in his teens would compete with a hundred-year-old crowd was a difference in training that couldn't be understated.

Finally acquiring a new apprentice, and such an excellent one at that, he believed that given time, she wouldn't fall short of his eldest disciple. 

For these years, he had traveled far and wide in search of a promising disciple, as ever since he took on three apprentices, he hadn’t found any new recruits, and those three had each hit a bottleneck.

But cultivation was not something that could be rushed; thus, to uncover the potential in natural abilities, he had to roam about, hunting for rare species instead. 

The fun in that was not for others to know! 

He had nearly given up hope, as his eldest disciple was capable of taking care of the other two apprentices, so he had somewhat settled into a state of inaction. 

Hearing about a new disciple, he meant to take it seriously but happened upon a rare species, which distracted him for a while. 

After all, his disciple was there and wouldn’t run away, which is why he’d delayed a few days. 

Now, witnessing his little disciple’s astonishing talent made him wake up from meditation with a smile on his face! 

"Lian'er, you have a great talent; make sure you cultivate diligently!" 

"I will, Master!" 

Wen Gu couldn’t help but ask, "Master, what about the sugarcane?" 

"It’s fine! Although I’ve never seen it before, since it’s Lian'er’s innate plant, it surely has its reason for existing. I won’t be going anywhere for a while; this sugarcane is something for me to study!"

"Master, I know, I know! This is called sugarcane. If you peel off this outer layer, it’s edible and sweet; you have to spit out the pulp after eating it. Besides, it can also be used to make sugar. I've eaten a lot as well; it's quite sweet!"

Saying this, she casually chopped a stalk, and after a moment's thought, with a flick of her wrist, a white porcelain plate appeared, on which the sugarcane was cut into bite-sized pieces. 

"Sweet?" 

"Master, try it! I promise you'll like it!" 

Having been startled by her other disciple's sweet treats before, yet for the sake of researching a new species, he decided to give it a whirl. 

Picking up a piece, he observed its shape; nothing seemed special. 

He took a whiff; there was a hint of sweetness. 

With a squeeze, it didn’t feel like ordinary fruit’s softness, and pressing harder yielded plenty of juice... 

He put it in his mouth and took a bite; it was crisp and sweet without being cloying.

“Master, you must spit out the pulp!” 

As a good disciple for his master, Lin Yu smartly held up another empty plate, making it convenient for Master to spit out the pulp while studying it. 

Though spitting out pulp had little elegance, it was for the sake of research… 

“Master, how is it?” 

“Not bad! It contains unique spiritual energy; after eating it, I feel the spiritual energy throughout my body is very comfortable.” 

“...Really? I didn’t feel anything.” She only thought it was very sweet and tasty! 

“You? All you know is to eat.” 

“Hehe!” 

“Gu’er, Zhi Zhi, Lian'er, did you all notice anything?” 

“I didn’t pay attention; let me try again.” 

After all, as the eldest disciple, he was not as greedy as the younger one! He grabbed another piece to taste! 

“I only feel that this sugarcane makes me very happy after finishing it.” 

After all, sweet foods always uplift the spirit! Wen Zhi also picked up a piece. 

“Really?” 

Lian Lian herself had no idea that her sugarcane had an effect on spiritual energy. 

Looking at her disciples, Master Qingyang said, 
“You’re not advanced enough yet; this subtle change may not be detectable. I have some old ailments; consuming it makes the spiritual energy calm and feels wonderful. It’s okay; once you all cultivate further, you’ll notice!” 

Lin Yu observed his disciples still engrossed in studying the sugarcane, while Master’s smile was nearly reaching his ears, but none of that mattered! 

Looking up at the sky, the most important thing right now was…
