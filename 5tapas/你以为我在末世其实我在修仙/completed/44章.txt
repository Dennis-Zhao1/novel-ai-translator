**Chapter 1: The Undead Dilemma**

How could there be zombies in this world? 

With bulging eyes, ashen skin, and an aura of decay, the villagers of Wei Bao had, against all odds, succumbed to a dreadful fate—becoming zombies! 

No matter the circumstances, Wei Bao Village must not fall! By gently channeling earth energy, the villagers could revert from their ghastly forms to that of ordinary people, as long as they weren’t subjected to extreme stimuli. 

Indeed, it was during the tournament that Annabelle Gan had been so startled by the transformation of Wei Bao Village that she lost control of her strength, sending a contestant flying. Therefore, after the competition, she felt compelled to bring him back!

At first, she thought it was merely a nightmare from the trials—could zombies have existed even in the ancient realms of cultivation? But weren’t they referred to as "jiangshi" rather than zombies?

Or perhaps it wasn’t a dream at all, but rather something she genuinely experienced. So, was the apocalypse she witnessed real or imaginary? 

***

When Annabelle opened the door, she was startled to find a large face right in front of her! 

“Are you alright, Junior Sister?” 

“I'm fine.” 

“Oh… that’s good to hear! By the way, what about the person inside?” 

“He’s heavily injured and still unconscious, but he should be okay.” 

“Really, Junior Sister, are you really okay?” 

She saw her fellow seniors sitting in the distance, appearing to sip tea and watch the sunset while secretly eavesdropping. 

“I’m fine! Senior Brother, could you keep an eye on Wei Bao Village for me? I have some questions for him. It's late; I need to prepare dinner!” With that, she swiftly walked away. 

Lin Yu scratched his head, looking at the other two who appeared more intelligent than him: “Is everything alright?” 

They closed their folding fans and stood to leave, stating, “For now, everything seems fine.” 

***

Meanwhile, while munching on sugarcane, a small, wandering beast was scouring the entire Lan Mountain Sect but didn’t find what it was looking for. Suddenly hearing a noise, it ducked into nearby bushes. 

“Hey, Senior Brother, did you hear? This year's Great Sect Competition has made one of our new female disciples famous!” 

“Are you talking about Annabelle Gan, the one with the ‘Stick of Purple Hitting the World’? She’s reputed to be super strong; I heard from the other disciples at the competition that she could defeat her opponents with just one move.” 

“Exactly! Do you think she’ll make it to the top ten?” 

“It’s hard to say! Our sect usually keeps a low profile. But this year might be different! I heard Master Qing Yang hasn’t left the sect this year and is focused on training his disciples!” 

“Really? The Lan Mountain Sect might have a chance this year! I’ve even heard that several seniors are planning to attend the competition in person!” 

“Is that so? I should hurry and gather my things!” 

“Hey, Senior Brother, wait for me!” 

After they passed, a furry little beast poked its head out. It seemed to ponder something. Then, it chased after the two disciples.

***

Lin Yu was in the room with the injured Wei Bao, animatedly recounting tales of his daring Junior Sister. 

“In short, every sect you wanted to join are all frauds. If not for my Junior Sister saving you, you might not have made it back alive!” 

Wei Bao couldn’t help but smile bitterly; he had encountered swindlers right after leaving his village, a case of misjudgment. 

“Thank you!” 

“Let’s eat first; my Junior Sister’s cooking is extraordinary! You’re in for a treat!” 

Staring at the lavish spread before him, Wei Bao was still in disbelief. 

“Are these... all for me?” 

His village had never had such a sumptuous meal! 

“Yes, my Junior Sister said it was specially prepared for the injured. I haven’t had the chance to eat it myself!” 

As soon as Annabelle and her companions walked in, he was already overflowing with gratitude. 

“What are your plans now?” 

“...I’m not sure. My village's situation is unique. It took me a long time to come out! I originally thought joining a sect would change our village's fate. Who knew…” 

“What happened to your village?” 

“I’m not sure if the immortals have heard of it—the Monster Village.” 

Wen Gu and Lin Yu shook their heads, showing they had no knowledge of it. 

Even the most well-informed senior brother and the gossip-prone junior brother were in the dark…

“I’ve never heard of it.” 

“Our village is near Hai City. The village chief said that decades ago, we were all normal townsfolk. After a great war, those who survived turned into monsters that everyone shuns!” 

“What kind of monsters?” 

“I’m afraid to say…” 

Annabelle pretended to joke, “Could it be the kind with green skin and white eyes?” 

Wei Bao looked at her curiously, “We don’t have those kinds of monsters!” 

“Uh…” 

Then you might not fully comprehend your own situation! 

“Many in my village have human heads but animal bodies, or they are deformed: some have one eye, some lack tongues, noses, hands, or feet, and it’s all common. According to the village elders, some have missing organs, and though they shouldn’t be able to survive, as monsters, they thrive…” 

Trying not to frighten them, he didn’t go into more detail: “In short, there’s an array of oddities, and there are no newborns. Even the children born are all deformed and can't survive! Everyone says our village is full of monsters, with no ordinary folk.” 

Lin Yu couldn’t help but retort, “Aren’t you a normal person?” 

“Me? I might not be normal either. The village chief said I used to look like a monster when I was younger! If it weren’t for me being so hungry one day and stumbling into the mountains in search of food, I wouldn’t have met an immortal. The immortal took pity on my unusual appearance, treated me, and gave me a medicinal pill, which is how I slowly returned to normal! And the village chief said my strength is also considered extraordinary!” 

If he really did meet an immortal, he must have ingested some sort of elixir! 

“Ah… this is…” 

Lin Yu was encountering someone with such a tragic story for the first time. 

Wen Gu and Wen Zhi couldn’t help but frown, their expressions mirroring each other. 

“So, you wish to enter a sect? You want some elixirs to change your village's fate?” 

Unexpectedly, his thoughts had been so discernible, it was as if the immortals understood him. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he said: “Yes. Since I could change to a normal person after taking the elixir, I thought, if I could get some for my village folks, maybe they can change too. So, I told the village chief that I wanted to leave and join the sect. This would give me a chance to break the curse of being in Monster Village and live a normal life!” 

“Then why did you believe those con artists? Haven’t you heard of Lan Mountain Sect?” 

“I… I didn’t know!” 

At this, Wei Bao looked rather innocent: “I came from the deep mountains looking for a sect, but I fainted from hunger on the way. That master, the one who tricked me, saw my strength and claimed that if I made it into the top ten, he would take me as his disciple, so I agreed.” 

How unfortunate! This boy must be studied; perhaps, other zombies were still out there in his village… 

Annabelle asked, “Is your village still near Hai City?” 

“Oh no, we’ve long since moved! We now reside deep in the mountains.” 

“Deep in the mountains?” 

“Yes! However, according to the village's elders, our old home was once a thriving place—right by the sea with a bustling town. After that war, those who survived became monsters, and we could no longer stay where we once lived. Villagers followed the current village chief to relocate to our current desolate mountain. Even so, our population continues to dwindle, and life is getting harder and harder…” 

“After the competition, I’ll go see your village with you.” 

“Really? Immortal! Can you help our village? I will bow in gratitude!” 

Surely, an immortal who could save him with elixirs could help the others in his village. Wei Bao began to bow, but Annabelle quickly supported him: “No need for that. You just need to focus on recovering. After the tournament, I’ll accompany you back to your village!” 

“Thank you, Immortal! Thank you!” 

Seeing his Junior Sister’s determined expression, her companions didn’t dare to stop her. At worst, they would all go along together at the time. 

Annabelle was unaware of her seniors’ thoughts; all she knew was that:

Some things, she must verify with her own eyes!
