**About Superpowers**

"Hm? Superpowers? What superpowers? I just have a magical system... that's all!"

"What superpowers?"

"Those types you often read about in apocalyptic novels! Because of a natural disaster, like heavy rain or something, many people will awaken different elemental powers like metal, wood, water, fire, and earth! Did you see those two machetes my dad has? Aren't they super cool? I tried them out, they’re really sharp~ It's a shame my dad is so stingy and won’t let me have a go, sigh!"

*Cough cough, getting off track here!*

"But I can definitely say that my dad has awakened a metal elemental power! Isn't that super awesome?"

She spoke with an excited expression, clearly proud of her father's abilities!

"Hehe~ Girl, you can't fool me; you’re definitely not an ordinary person! Just look at the changes in your place! You can tell me in secret, I promise I won’t tell anyone."

"Um? Actually..." She realized she might need a reason to explain things for future actions.

"I wouldn't say I have a superpower; if it counts, does building houses qualify as a superpower?"

Gavin clapped, "I knew it! You must have superpowers! Girl, that’s so cool!"

He couldn’t help but give Lavender a thumbs up!

"Hey, can you teach me how to awaken my powers? My dad says it just appears with a swoosh, right? He wouldn’t be lying, would he?"

"…Actually, I don’t know, maybe everyone is different."

After all, she hadn’t seen how others manifested their supposed powers, so it was better to say less and avoid mistakes. Although Gavin and his dad seemed trustworthy, some things were hard to explain.

However, thinking about Gavin's acceptance of the apocalyptic scenario, Lavender felt a spark of inspiration!

"Okay then. So what can your powers do, Lavender? Any special abilities?"

"Building houses."

"What?"

"Believe it or not, my power is to build houses, and it’s quite unique. This shipping container house? I built it."

"What? What?!"

Seeing the rain stop outside, Lavender thought, since you don’t believe me, I’ll let you see for yourself.

"How about this, I’ll go build you a house! You can witness it yourself."

"That sounds great! Girl, let's go, let’s go~"

When Gavin saw a stack of 1-square-meter panels appearing out of thin air, his eyes lit up.

Then, following Lavender outside, he watched as she casually took a piece from the top, compared it with the existing house, and just started fitting it together!

As she went for more panels, Gavin couldn’t help but touch the seamlessly connected floor in awe, amazed by its magic.

After she built a one-meter-wide corridor, another stack of wooden panels appeared, and when he saw the little girl lift a panel larger than herself, Gavin finally reacted.

"Hey, Lavender, I can do this too! Can I give it a try?"

"Sure, if you don’t mind the hassle!"

After all, she had already confirmed with Sisi that the foundational work didn’t all have to be done manually; the “core technology” was in her hands!

"How could I mind! Leave this tough work to me!"

"Alright, you give it a shot! Just align them… and then…"

When Gavin’s dad, Mr. Guan, returned on his little tricycle, he was surprised to find a new container house standing tall where there had been none before!

Gavin, who had previously appeared weak, was now glowing with energy, holding a ladder as he stepped out of the newly constructed house.

"Dad, you’re here? Come quickly, we just finished building a house!"

Without waiting for Mr. Guan to react, he put down the ladder and dragged him inside.

【Sisi, this house looks… rather ordinary?】

【Yes, Lavender, because your house is the main hub for the base! The others are just sturdier houses, and currently, they’ll need to figure out how to get water and electricity! But if our levels increase later, we can provide that.】

【Um, do we actually have a water and power supply area?】

【Yes, it’s located underground in your house! Otherwise, Lavender, where do you think your room gets its water and electricity from?】

I’m sorry, I thought it was just a feature of the powerful and mysterious system!

Everything felt so non-scientific; having water, electricity, and gas built in seemed unreasonable!

"Hey, Lavender, um… can I tell my dad about your powers? I promise both of us are trustworthy! If you want, I can swear an oath!"

Seeing Gavin’s shining eyes, Lavender nodded, "Sure, go ahead! You didn’t keep your dad's powers a secret from me, right?"

"Lavender, you’re so understanding! Hahaha! From now on, you’re like my sister!"

Saying that, without waiting for Lavender’s reaction, he went to pull his dad again.

Mr. Guan, exhausted from the day’s work, thought, can't you let me rest for a minute!

"Dad, look! Lavender’s superpower is building houses. The materials are amazing; once they fit together, they create seamless connections! It’s much easier than how we built houses and super sturdy. Plus, Lavender says these materials can keep zombies out!"

Realization washed over Mr. Guan, and he nodded, "Mm, that power is quite good; it makes sense why it’s so safe."

He patted the walls, feeling their solidity, and thought for a moment before reminding the two kids: "Keep this power business to yourselves; don’t go blabbing everywhere. Especially you, Gavin!"

"Dad, I know! I’m just chatting with you two. I’m reliable!"

He patted his chest, swearing his complete loyalty!

"And, and also, Lavender says this will be our home now. Dad, this will be our new house, and we can be neighbors with Lavender, hehe!"

"This… Lavender, this…"

"Oh come on, Dad, don’t be like that. We can help her out more later, can’t we~"

"You cheeky boy, who told you to speak up?"

This unfilial son, I really don’t want him anymore!

"…Then I won’t be polite with you either, so thank you."

"Don’t mention it; you all helped me a lot too. It’s just the room is quite empty, lacking everything, so I hope you won’t mind."

It was just one shipping container, and the inside was dim; frankly, it couldn't be called a good living space!

"Dad, I’m feeling better now; Uncle Hua's medicine really works! Hehe, let’s move in now; I can't wait any longer."

"Wait a minute! Mr. Guan, I cooked some porridge. You must be hungry after so much work; eat something first, then we’ll move."

"Ah right, Dad should eat first; Lavender's porridge is delicious!"

It wasn’t much; the rice was all bought from your place.

"That works!"

Indeed, he was hungry~

After the meal, Mr. Guan made several trips from the house to bring things, leaving the “recovering” Gavin at home to tidy up.

Lavender helped out while also contributing the furniture they had stored in the warehouse earlier.

She originally wanted to help them build another room, but Mr. Guan refused.

Although the house was a bit small, it was still functional and cozy; no one knew what the future would hold, so having a place to land was sufficient for now.

"This place is enough for us two; we shouldn’t waste resources further. If… if we have more resources, let’s save it for those who need help more."

Even Gavin was nodding along in agreement.

"Got it."
