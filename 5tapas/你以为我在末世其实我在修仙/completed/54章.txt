**Molding Clay Figures**

Slowly and reluctantly, Grace Gan walked forward, turning back every few steps!

She cast a longing glance at her seniors, hoping for a bit of camaraderie from her fellow disciples!

Unfortunately! There was none!

The big brother and sister didn’t even glance up from their conversation, the two least talkative people suddenly engrossed in lively discussion today!

Even the little junior brother was seriously eyeing the candied hawthorns by the roadside!

But little junior brother, you’ve been staring at that one string for a long time now, it’s time to pick a different one!!

As for the Wei Bao Village... forget it, that was even less reliable!

Reluctantly, little Grace had to bear the responsibility herself!

When she finally stood before Master Nan Hua, she tilted her head to look directly into his eyes... the moment his gaze changed, she would quickly slip away →_→!

Holding a purse of money, she put on a bright smile:

"Mr. Si Nan, this is the allowance for our journey! This portion is for you, please accept it, and you can buy anything you need!"

Wen Zhi, Wen Gu, and Lin Yu had gathered together at some point!

Though they feigned talking quietly, they couldn’t help but steal glances at this side!

When they saw junior sister holding the money bag, Master Nan Hua simply glanced down at her.

The moment those eyes met, the three of them fell silent, tension filling the air!

Fortunately, their idol said nothing and reached out to take it!

Phew~ What a relief!

She was truly afraid he would refuse!

With a sense of accomplishment, Grace Gan turned and jogged back to the little trio!

Before she could open her mouth, Lin Yu pulled her away!

“Come on, little junior sister, let’s hurry and shop!”

Lin Yu had his eyes set on the bright red candied hawthorn, which looked absolutely delicious!

They both had to have a taste!

“Boss, I’ll take the whole string of hawthorns!!”

——

Wen Zhi found the sugar figures utterly fascinating, reminiscing about when she last played with clay figures centuries ago!

All the other children had sugar figures; how could her little junior sister be left out? Buy one!

“Boss, which of your sugar figures sells the best? Let’s make one for my little junior sister too.”

——

Wen Gu stopped in front of a clay figure stall, impressed by the craftsmanship of the elderly artisan—he was quite good for a mortal.

“Old master, your skill is impressive!”

“You flatter me! To be honest, this is thirty years of experience. Would you like to buy one?”

“Um… little junior sister, come here!”

With candied hawthorn in one hand and a sugar figure in the other, Grace Gan was helplessly summoned!

“Big brother!”

“Take a look, which one do you want?”

Staring at those lifelike clay figures, Grace was a bit moved.

“Master, can you mold us?”

After scrutinizing the group, the old master, well-seasoned with customers, recognized they were big clientele.

“I can, but it’ll take some time.”

“That's fine.”

“How many would you like?”

“Hmm… let’s make one for each of us six!”

We certainly can’t play favorites, right?

So, on the bustling streets of Fan City, six… oh no, five handsome men and women plus one strong man gathered around a clay figure stall, capturing quite a bit of attention.

As time passed, curious onlookers multiplied. What had been a quiet stall suddenly turned lively!

Men, women, old, and young gathered to watch:

“Wow, this master makes such beautiful clay figures!”

“Just look at those people; they’re already good-looking!”

“Well, that’s true, but Master Niu is an old artisan; his clay figures are truly lifelike! Plus, he captures the inner essence, not just the surface!”

“Inner essence? How do you see that?”

“If I knew how to perceive inner essence, I’d go mold clay figures myself!”

“...”

“Daddy, I want a clay figure too!”

“Okay, okay, let’s each get one for our little family of three!”

The seniors were accustomed to being observed, having witnessed countless spectacles.

However, perhaps due to their presence, the curious crowd hesitated to approach!

But Grace Gan felt a bit uncomfortable, especially since:

Big brother wielded his folding fan with effortless charm!

Sister stood there like a stunning landscape!

As for the little junior brother, he was hopping around with great energy!

And Master Nan Hua, without a doubt, stood out majestically, like a true immortal, incomparable by mortals!

And she! Yes, only she!

With both hands full of snacks, she felt embarrassed to eat!

Standing there, she felt awkward and out of place! Oh, how she wished to just sink into the ground!

Unfortunately, none of her fellow disciples showed her any affection! They were too busy discussing how lifelike those clay figures appeared!

She could only complain inwardly:

“Whether these clay figures are lifelike or not, I don't know! But I feel like a statue right now! If my seniors don't come to my rescue soon, I might just perform a dramatic faint right here!”

Then suddenly, she felt a shadow blocking the vague gazes surrounding her, and she sighed with relief.

Only then did she realize that Master Nan Hua had stood behind her, she didn’t even notice when he arrived!

His presence was so powerful that even without furrowing his brows, everyone could feel his exuding aura of impatience, and they dared not look in this direction.

Just as she was lost in thought, Wen Zhi approached, holding a purple clay figure:

“Junior sister, look, do you like it?”

It was indeed a clay figure! Despite being made of clay, it perfectly embodied her likeness, and the combination of the candied hawthorn and the clay figure was quite adorable!

As she was thinking of moving the hawthorn and clay figure into one hand to grab her own clay figure—!

A hand reached from behind, grabbing the clay figure’s body!

Grace Gan watched as her "self" slowly passed before her eyes!

With a gentle chuckle, the voice exclaimed:

“Heh, this little figure is quite unique!”

Just when Grace wanted to reach for her "self" to admire it properly.

At that moment, Lin Yu also came in, holding his own version of the “Master Nan Hua” clay figure in his hands.

“Mr. Si Nan, look at this!”

Receiving a copy of her likeness, Master Nan Hua seemed a bit displeased with it!

He compared his clay figure to hers:

“It’s not as good as yours!”

As he spoke, he scrutinized “Clay Figure Grace,” seeming to think that his version wasn’t as refined as the one in his hands!

Grace Gan couldn’t hold back anymore; she hadn’t even had a chance to admire her own clay figure!

“Uh... Mr. Si Nan, that’s my clay figure!”

“Hmm?”

Master Nan Hua seemed to finally register that he had taken her clay figure.

Being a celestial being, he couldn’t just keep a child’s treasures!

“Here, take it back to play with!”

With that, he turned and walked away!

It was too crowded and the lighting wasn’t ideal; she needed to find a brighter place to carefully examine it! She didn’t expect these clay figures to be quite interesting down here at the mountain!

Grace Gan found herself holding the “Master Nan Hua” clay figure in one hand and the candied hawthorn with the clay figure in the other!

She stood there dumbfounded!

Even the onlooking Wen Gu and the others didn’t know what to say!

While it might be true that Junior Sister’s clay figure was cuter, their idol had no right to take it away like that!

“Ahem, perhaps Mr. Si Nan thinks junior sister's clay figure is cuter~”

But no one dared to ask the celestial gentleman to return it!

“Maybe we can ask Master Zhang to make another one, ensuring it's identical!”

Master Niu couldn’t bear to watch any longer and interjected:

“Sir, that’s not quite right. I’ve been crafting clay figures for decades, and I never make two the same! No matter how many times it’s remade, it’ll never be exactly identical! Even if it’s replicated closely, it’ll still differ from the original!”

Turning to Grace Gan, he smiled:

“Little girl, don’t be upset! The moment I saw you, I felt inspiration strike, so I molded you first. Honestly, this figure turned out adorable and delicate! I’ve made thousands of clay figures; yours is undoubtedly among the best, and it’s natural for that young man to admire it!”

“But I haven’t even seen it myself yet!” she complained, feeling quite wronged!

“Since you’re all together, how about asking him to let you see it later?”

If it was her seniors, she might summon the courage, but asking such a big shot felt a bit daunting!

Noticing their dilemma, the old master didn’t insist further and simply pointed at the clay figure in Grace Gan's hand:

“If yours is among the best, then this one is surely not lacking! Why don’t you take a look!”

Grace Gan was momentarily stunned, as she hadn’t had the chance to examine it closely!

“Really?”

Raising the "Mr. Nan Hua" figure, she took a serious look and smiled!
