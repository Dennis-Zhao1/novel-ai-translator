### Reckless Whispers

甘岚岚, clinging to her small beast, seemed reluctant to let go, prompting Lin Yu to ready himself to snatch it away! 

“Little junior sister, that creature is dangerous. If you like it, I'll get you a better one,” he insisted, blocking the small beast's path as Gan Lanlan smiled gleefully.

“No need, big brother! It’s recognized me as its master!” 

Lin Yu looked dismayed at the bond between his little junior sister and the creature, his intention to spoil her thwarted. 

“Well, fine then!” he conceded.

Gan Lanlan held the small white beast in front of her, and seeing its big, watery eyes made her nose tingle a bit. 

“Don’t worry, sister! It won’t bite! It likes me, which is why it’s my master now! Isn't it adorable?” She pressed her face against the creature's, trying to comfort her concerned sister. 

Seeing her little sister so genuinely happy, Lin Yu and his companions felt an unspoken weight lift, deciding not to say anything more. After all, the bond was already formed. 

“Take good care of your little beast, and we’ll go prepare for our return. See you shortly!” 

“Okay! Have a safe trip, big brother and sister!” 

Leaving Gan Lanlan with her newfound companion, the older siblings allowed her the space to bond. 

Children, after all, love their toys and little animals—nothing out of the ordinary. They'll have to remember to get her something nice next time! 

Once everyone was far enough away, Gan Lanlan spun around several times with the little creature in her arms. 

“Cassie, is that really you?” 

“Lanlan! I’ve been looking for you for so long! I missed you!” 

“Cassie, why are you here? Aren't you a system? And why are you in beast form? What kind of creature are you?” 

Her excitement made her nearly lose control of herself. Luckily, Cassie had a gentle personality: 

“I was in a deep slumber and woke up like this. I don’t know why I’m this type of beast, but I remember you, Lanlan! So it’s okay! I can find you now!” 

With warm tears in her eyes, Gan Lanlan sniffed, “Thank you, Cassie! Thank you for remembering me!” 

“It’s nothing! I’m just glad I found you! I was searching everywhere and almost got caught by some people who wanted to take me as a prize! Luckily, I’m awesome, so they couldn't catch me! Hehe!” 

“Ah? So you're the divine beast they mentioned in the tournament? Who wanted to catch you?” 

I should really go confront them for being bold enough to try and take my Cassie! 

“Don’t worry! I kicked them all away!” 

“Wow, Cassie, you’re so strong!” 

“Mm-hmm! And now I can protect you too!” 

Hearing this, Gan Lanlan finally calmed down. 

“Cassie, since you’re here, does that mean our experiences during the apocalypse were real?” 

“No, Lanlan! I didn’t come from there. I’ve always been a beast in this world. I ended up in your dreams because I was sleeping! I found you by following the sugar cane forest and your sect’s people. Otherwise, I might not have found you!” 

“Really? It doesn’t exist? But there are zombies in this world!” 

“Zombies? How could there be zombies in this world? Are you sure you weren't mistaken?” 

“I can’t be mistaken. Once these matters are settled, I’ll go investigate! I can’t be at ease otherwise.” 

“Don’t worry, Lanlan! I’ll always be with you!” 

Saying that, Cassie nuzzled Gan Lanlan’s face with her fluffy body. 

“Hehe, with you here, I won't feel lonely anymore.” She patted Cassie's smooth fur, feeling content. 

“Yes! I’ve recognized you as my master, so we can stay together forever!” 

“How wonderful!” 

Sensing Gan Lanlan’s lingering worry about zombies, Cassie comforted her, “Don't stress about the zombies. It’s not a big deal, considering the wonders of the cultivation world.” 

Hearing this made Gan Lanlan feel less alarmed. 

“But after resolving the matters with the Alliance Leader, I still want to investigate. I can’t just ignore it.” 

“Wherever you go, I’ll go with you!” 

“Thank you, Cassie!” 

She kissed Cassie’s fur, savoring the moment. So much better than the virtual images in the star network!

The next afternoon, most participants in the grand competition were preparing to return. 

Though informed by her brothers about the dangers of the secret realms and equipped with protective charms, Gan Lanlan had a sense that this trip would be mostly safe! 

Cassie was hidden away, as she could not let anyone else take her precious beast. 

Though not worried about losing her, she disliked the potential hassle! 

A spaceship carried everyone towards… well, wherever. For those who couldn’t distinguish directions, North, South, East, and West were irrelevant! 

Don’t ask, because front, back, left, and right made much more sense! 

But in the air, distinguishing front from back was difficult! 

As the younger ones on the ship gathered to admire the view, they initially saw majestic mountains and clear water. 

As they flew deeper, the surroundings became increasingly desolate, and the sky began to darken, contributing to an oppressive atmosphere. 

When they reached an area with strange stone formations, the ship descended. 

The leader of the Alliance, Master Huahua, struck a wall with a magical incantation, revealing a dark cave, resembling a monster’s gaping mouth ready to swallow them all. 

“Follow me inside!” he ordered, stepping in first. 

Master Qingyan glanced at his disciples, wanting to express concern but fearing it might dampen their spirits. Instead, he cautioned them, 

“Be careful. If you sense danger, crush your retreat tokens immediately.” 

“Yes, Master.” 

Upon entering, it felt as if they were stepping into a void. Without magical lamps to illuminate their path, it would have been rather terrifying. 

After all, darkness is humanity's greatest fear, especially when unknown creatures occasionally attacked from the shadows, heightening the danger. 

Ultimately, the unknown is always a source of fear! 

The three senior leaders alongside Master Qingyan fended off several waves of mysterious attacks. 

Gan Lanlan and her siblings stayed close together, keeping each other alert and occasionally striking back. 

They walked for what felt like ages until their illuminating treasures began dimming… no, the darkness was thickening, noticeably overpowering the light. 

“We've arrived,” said the leader. “We can only go this far; the next part is up to you.” 

The five looked at the uniform, ink-black wall before them, sharing uncertain glances. 

“Alliance Leader, I’ve been curious about how you confirmed that only those with the power of nature can enter this place.” 

“To be honest, we’ve tested it with various charms, and most techniques were ineffective! Only those with nature's power can proceed. It's not that we didn’t wish to investigate ourselves, but we were powerless. So the rest is in your hands—be cautious.” 

“Thank you for the information. We will proceed with caution.” 

Master Qingyan turned to his students, reiterating, 

“Let’s go! If there’s any danger, crush your retreat tokens immediately and do not take risks!” 

“Yes, Master!” 

Wenzhi quickly grabbed Gan Lanlan’s hand, “Be careful, little sister.” 

“Big sister, you too.” 

As the five stepped into the ink-colored wall, it rippled like water. 

Masters Xuanqing and Huahua waited outside, ready to assist. 

Just as they noticed the five entering without any repulsion, their joy was cut short when, in the blink of an eye, three figures appeared back in their original position!
