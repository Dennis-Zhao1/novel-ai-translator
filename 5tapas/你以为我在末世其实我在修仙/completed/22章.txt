**The Last Days: The Peach Blossom Spring**

Aside from specialized agricultural zones, there are dedicated animal and botanical gardens. There’s even a pet park where many in the base have entrusted their surviving, unmutated pets. If this were before the apocalypse, the construction of these facilities would seem reasonable. However, amidst the apocalypse, when human resources are scarce, how could they possibly waste supplies on pets?

David Wang, as the spokesperson for the base, explained: “When we began to establish these areas, a lot of people actually opposed it. After all, when people can hardly feed themselves, who cares about pets? But our base leader said something that I still remember!”

David recalled how a girl who always seemed soft and fragile suddenly became serious, her eyes blazing with fire as she cradled a dog that had lost a leg while trying to save its owner: “When danger approaches, they rush out without hesitation to save you, yet you say ‘don’t bother with me.’ In peaceful times, they are family, but during chaos, you complain about them missing limbs? Have you ever thought about who they sacrificed their limbs for? I declare right here, they were family before, and they remain family! Anyone who disagrees, the door is over there—feel free to leave!”

After saying this, she focused on caring for the homeless animals. 

“Honestly, looking back now, that decision really was correct! Just look at them…” David smiled as he looked at the lively little creatures. “How simple and happy they are! Whenever I feel that life is difficult, I come here to watch these carefree little ones. Even dragging a broken body, they still bounce around full of life… Haha, perhaps happiness is indeed contagious!” 

He pointed to a corner: “Team Leader Hua, over there—that's Big White and its three newborn pups… Ah! The arrival of new life always brings joy.” 

Team Leader Hua and his team were profoundly moved; they felt that being here was completely different from the harrowing journey they had experienced. They were struck with awe. 

“Ahem, of course, later our base leader also pointed out that if it weren’t for these animals and plants requiring care, how could we create job opportunities for ordinary people? Going out would be akin to sending supplies to zombies; it’s better to care for these fur babies right here!” 

“…” 

“So, I have to admire our base leader; she thinks farther ahead than I do.” 

“She has built this base wonderfully!” 

“Exactly. That’s why ordinary people can also live well in our base. Tsk, tsk, it’s a win-win… Let’s go, let’s go! Meal time is approaching; we should hurry to the first canteen. It’s quite a walk from here, and we need to eat well.” 

Team Leader Hua and the others gradually digested everything. The more they learned about the base, the more they sensed its uniqueness. It might not be the strongest, a bit isolated, and had its quirks, but it was sufficiently inclusive and open, embodying the tradition of tolerance that had long been a hallmark of their country. Moreover, whether it was the development of agriculture or the provision for students to continue learning, or giving ordinary people job opportunities—many larger bases could not achieve these.

The smiling faces and the spontaneous praises from the populace were the best testimonials. This place might truly be the “Peach Blossom Spring” of the apocalypse!

As for the seemingly unremarkable base leader, who resembled a neighborly little sister, Team Leader Hua grew increasingly curious.

Due to its remote location, it took some time for the investigation team to arrive, but the base continued to develop steadily and systematically according to plan. With the arrival of the first batch of investigators, although Team Leader Hua had provided basic knowledge of this large production base, nothing compared to seeing it firsthand.

The higher-ups expressed great importance to this location, arranging to strengthen security measures, and also planning to transport the first batch of grain from the sugarcane base to support other bases. They would eventually need to venture out again. Therefore, Gwendolyn Chen had already begun her next plan, specially inviting Team Leader Hua and the newly arrived Team Leader Hao to a meeting.

“I believe both of you are aware that while our base doesn’t possess particularly powerful individuals, due to the unique nature of the base’s construction, safety is generally not a concern. Previously, we couldn’t communicate with the outside world due to damaged communication equipment, but now we can connect and share resources.” 

Team Leader Hao nodded seriously; the base’s powerful grain production capabilities sparked excitement within him.

“I trust you’ve also realized that, currently, the zombies and mutated flora and fauna are not overly formidable.” 

Team Leader Hao continued to nod. After all, those dispatched for this trip had all been capable individuals, but they had encountered a few crises during their journey, and everyone bore some scars, though losses were minimal.

“Our base has been able to avoid zombie intrusion primarily due to the materials used in construction. I am willing to provide materials and assist in building bridges and roads.” 

Hearing this, Team Leader Hao and Team Leader Hua exchanged glances and sat up straighter. 

Team Leader Hua asked: “Though I don’t mean to pry into the secrets of the base, it’s said that the construction materials for the sugarcane base are related to your abilities?” 

“Indeed.” 

Team Leader Hao stood up excitedly. This was excellent defensive material; with it, their country would surely gain an advantage. “How many of these materials can your base leader provide? What kind of compensation do you need? Just tell us, and we’ll do what we can.” 

Gwendolyn shook her head; she understood that such special materials were indeed rare. From the feedback from Team Leader Hao and his companions, it seemed that similar materials had not yet appeared in the world, which made these even more reflective of her unique abilities. 

Not only their country but anyone would desire materials that could completely isolate radiation and zombies in the apocalypse! 

“It’s not that I am unwilling to provide; rather, these materials, even if you use them, will merely become ordinary boards without a connection to the sugarcane base. It’s like an electric wire without power, after all. That’s why I propose we build bridges and roads leading outward from the sugarcane base to expand connections as much as possible.” 

They never expected such reasoning, and Gwendolyn even specially demonstrated it on-site. 

A house was built outside the base, and because of the presence of living beings, it naturally attracted zombies to almost claw through the walls. 

She generously offered the materials for them to conduct their own experiments… 

Fortunately, the military was decisive, immediately gathering experts to research routes to cover surrounding areas as extensively as possible. 

They also reached out to as many bases as they could contact, hoping they could send more personnel to speed up construction. 

After all, to survive longer, one must prioritize building roads. 

Thus, the routes radiating out from the sugarcane base slowly began to pave a massive transportation network.
