**Dragons' Clash: The Dark Dragon vs. The Purple Dragon**

Looking up at the enormous shadow that had suddenly appeared overhead, Annabelle calmly said, "Senior Brother, it's too late."

Feeling the oppressive aura above, Lucas couldn't help but look up, his eyes widening in shock! What kind of monster is this?

There was no time for explanations now; she quickly sent Lucas and her companion, Sophie, into the "Cane Mongolian Tent," using all her protective talismans to strengthen the tent's defenses.

Turning back to gently stroke Sophie's nose, she noticed that Sophie had grown larger and now towered above her.

**[Sophie, you stay here and help take care of them, okay?]**

**[No way, Annabelle! I want to stick with you! We promised!]**

**[Be a good girl; we can only rely on you here.]**

Sophie’s big eyes brimmed with tears—this scene struck a chord in her memory! 

In a whimpering voice in Annabelle's mind, she asked, **[Are you really leaving me again?]**

Annabelle comfortingly patted her soft fur. Though her pet had grown large, her fur still felt comforting!

**[I won't, Sophie. You have to trust me. I promise I’ll be fine this time.]**

Sophie scrutinized her, as if trying to gauge the genuineness of her words. **[Sophie, trust me!]**

Ultimately, Sophie relented; she could never refuse Annabelle. **[Then you must, must come back!]**

**[I will! Definitely!]**

Turning to the villagers nearby, Annabelle said, "Mayor Dawid, Brother Bao, please help me look after my Senior Brother!"

"Sure! You take care, Master!" Mayor Dawid replied, concern etched on his face.

**"Don’t worry!"** 

Under everyone's watchful eyes, she stepped out of the protective circle formed by the cane.

Alone, facing the frenzied dark sorcerers, the soul-devouring creatures, and the massive western dark dragon overhead!

It seemed they were genuinely going all out this time; however, as long as she was there, no one would touch the people of Cane Village.

With her arms outstretched, as she activated her spells, a fierce wind began to blow, and her hair danced wildly around her.

From beneath her feet, a mass of canes began to grow wildly, quickly surrounding her. 

Soon, more and more purple canes thrived, blocking out the moonlight while faintly glowing.

Then, they formed into a gigantic… cane dragon!

“Roar!”

The purple dragon first circled the ground, flattening everything in its way except the Cane Mongolian Tent.

Then it shot into the sky, engaging the dark dragon in a fierce battle.

Lucas, clutching his chest, watched intently with Mayor Dawid’s support. If his junior sister was in danger, he still had the life-saving talisman his father had given him that could save her!

His other hand clutched a rescue talisman that had been flashing for a while; yet, no one had responded.

Where were his Master, father, and the sect leader?

When he saw Annabelle transform into a purple Eastern dragon, Lucas's mouth dropped open!

Observing the clearly advantageous purple dragon overhead, he couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh my goodness! I knew my junior sister was powerful, but I didn’t know she was *this* powerful!”

**[Annabelle is the best!]**

Sophie leapt beside him, bouncing with excitement, but she forgot her size was now that of a horse, causing the ground to shake a little. Fortunately, no one paid it any mind.

In the sky, two massive dragons were locked in combat. Compared to the clumsy dark dragon, the purple dragon was agile, dashing past with flashes of white light—those were sword energies!

The purple dragon flew around the dark dragon, occasionally landing a strike.

The dark dragon, annoyed by the persistent attacks, swayed its head side to side—looking rather foolish!

Though the dark dragon had tough skin, the sword energy left multiple small cuts on its body.

In a fit of rage, it prepared to unleash a fiery breath.

Lucas saw the monstrous beast breathe fire and shouted excitedly, **“Junior Sister, be careful!”**

“Ah, what is that scary thing? It can breathe fire!” 

He anxiously glanced at the rescue talisman in his hand again: “Master, Sect Leader, Father, Haozi, where are you? Why isn’t anyone responding! If you don’t come soon, I might not get to see anyone again!”

The dark dragon released a blast of fire, scattering the purple dragon. The sky was alight with what resembled thousands of purple fireworks!

However, in an instant, they coalesced into a new form of a purple dragon!

Upon close inspection, this purple dragon was indistinguishable from the previous one!

The purple dragon emitted a roar directed at the black dark dragon, as if to taunt, “Dummy! Hahaha, can’t defeat me, can you!”

The dark dragon was enraged!

Unfortunately, it was immediately struck by a tail swipe from the purple dragon, leaving it dazed!

The dark sorcerers below anxiously discussed among themselves:

“Lord Hux, what do we do? The dark dragon is no match for her!” 

“I have a plan!” 

He took out a whistle, signaling the dark dragon.

The dark dragon, which had been tussling with the purple dragon, immediately ceased its pursuit upon hearing the whistle.

Instead, it dove toward the ground, seemingly gathering power.

Annabelle sensed the threat and thought, “Not good; it's going to breathe fire!”

Lucas and the villagers of Cane Village watched through the gaps in the canes as the gigantic creature prepared to unleash a torrent of fire upon them.

Lucas's eyes reflected the colossal flames, which seemed to bear the aura of death; they were getting ever closer!

Fortunately, just as the flames touched the Cane Mongolian Tent, they rebounded off, thanks to the numerous protective charms Annabelle had placed earlier.

But before everyone could breathe a sigh of relief, the dark dragon unleashed another fiery blast.

What had been a one-time lighter had now become a continuous flame thrower!

Areas close to the dark dragon’s inferno turned into charred remains, except for the patches where canes thrived as life continued.

As the dark dragon’s flames approached the Cane Village Tent, a massive purple net suddenly appeared to block it!

Yet, above, the purple dragon had vanished!

Seeing Annabelle descend before them, Lucas worriedly asked, "Junior Sister, are you alright? Did you get hurt?"

Sophie’s large head rushed over to nuzzle against Annabelle's cheek, almost knocking her off balance.

“Don’t worry, I’m fine.”

The dark sorcerers guarding the periphery exchanged anxious looks:

"This… Lord Hux, they are too strong; even the dark dragon cannot defeat them! We don’t have much time left! What shall we do now?"

Hux hadn’t anticipated that he’d encounter such difficulty. He had thought it would be a simple task: just a few ordinary people!

They had lured away the master cultivator of Mount Wan Zhi, had soul-devourers and the dark dragon accompanying them, yet it was proving so challenging!

He had mocked those who wanted the dark dragon, believing it to be overkill.

Yet now, they were confronting an opponent who could take down even a dark dragon!

Hux gritted his teeth, “She’s alone; let’s all attack together and end this swiftly!”

Due to the relentless assault, the giant cane net was starting to show signs of wear.

Annabelle had no choice but to raise her hands and exert all her strength to hold it up!

Enduring the cosmic collision didn't feel as hard as this! 

But now, facing the dark dragon’s continuous flames, with dark sorcerers casting spells one after the other and soul-devourers bearing down on her, she felt the strain.

She layered her energies, reinforcing the cane protective net!

This was a test of endurance; she knew she couldn’t back down.

The dark dragon seemed to tire from breathing fire and resorted to using its claws, ripping at the cane net and flapping its wings to take to the sky.

The resistance had already drained much of Annabelle's strength, and now, with the dark dragon pulling on the massive net, she felt the pressure intensify.

Yet even so, she persisted.

Her vision began to blur; she shook her head vigorously, trying to stay alert...

For a moment, the battle reached a stalemate!
