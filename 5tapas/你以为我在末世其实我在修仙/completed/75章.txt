**Chapter Translation**

**Time Mirror**

“After this battle, I realized I'm still not strong enough. You can easily wave your hand and repel enemies, but I...”

Seeing that Lanlan Gan appeared somewhat dejected, Jun Nan Hua quickly consoled her, “You have powerful abilities; you just lack experience.”

Lanlan furrowed her brow, “Didn’t you say that the Great War between East and West is approaching? How can I find the time to gain experience? If a war breaks out, I fear I’ll just be cannon fodder.”

“I might have a solution. I possess a treasure called the ‘Time Mirror’. If you wish to improve your combat skills, this is the best option. Time inside the mirror flows differently; one day in reality equates to a hundred years inside.”

Lanlan’s eyes brightened, “Such a marvelous item exists?”

“Only…,”

“Only what?”

Nan Hua looked at her earnestly, “It will be very arduous! Inside the ‘Time Mirror’, there are all sorts of trials, from heavenly thunder to earth fire. I don't want you to suffer through it.”

Lanlan gazed up at him, “I’m not afraid of hardship; I embrace it. Who hasn’t gone through struggles to achieve happiness?”

After tiring from looking up, she began walking slowly alongside Nan Hua, reminiscing about the past: “Before the apocalypse, I remember from the moment I became aware, every day was either about studying or taking exams. Grades mattered most; they reflected my parents' moods and were the main topic of conversation in the neighborhood. A life crushed by grades was not easy. After every college entrance exam, it was time to destroy the textbooks.

I finally got into university and experienced a few years of a ‘relaxed’ lifestyle, but upon graduation, I faced unemployment! Life turned into a maze of confusion, and I began to understand the harsh realities of society. Where was the ease in that?

After entering the workforce, working 9-to-9 and burning the midnight oil just to make ends meet was tiresome as well.

By the time I had saved up a bit, my parents had aged significantly, and then cancer struck, making life even more challenging. How could that be easy?

Until the apocalypse, when life was constantly under threat; if it weren’t for survival, who would willingly face those monsters?

If it weren’t for survival, I wouldn’t need to work so hard to build a base or exhaust myself fighting meteors.

Now that I’m in the world of cultivation, should I really be looking forward to retirement?

I believe everyone has their own responsibilities. At least for me, it is not yet time to retire.”

Nan Hua still looked worried, “But I’m here; I don’t want you to suffer like this.”

Lanlan shook her head, “If I want to avoid suffering later, then help me become stronger!”

“I…”

Lanlan softly reassured him, “Didn’t you say a hundred years in the mirror equals a day in reality? Let me go; just wait for me a few days.”

Fully aware he could never convince her, he understood that the girl he liked had always been so independent and strong-willed. 

For the first time, Nan Hua decided to step away from Guan Xin’s usual obedience to Lanlan and asserted, “This time I will definitely go with you! Wherever you are, I’ll be by your side!”

He absolutely would not let the apocalyptic scenario happen again.

“But, in the celestial realm…”

“There’s no but; it’s just a few days. With so many people, they can’t all rely on me alone. Look at me; when I simply closed off for a bit, it resulted in the massacre of Nan City. That was their incompetence. It’s time to let them train properly!”

As he said this, he proudly raised his head, refusing to look at her: “Besides, I also have more important people to accompany!”

Lanlan looked next to her and felt a familiar ‘adorable’ charm from him at that moment.

“If we can make it through safely this time, then we’ll give it a try.”

Nan Hua’s eyes lit up, “Really? You’re willing to marry me?”

“Just giving it a try. It’s not like we’re getting married right now!”

“It's a promise; you can’t backtrack! Let’s hurry and get into the ‘Time Mirror’!”

“…There’s no need to rush like that.”

“How can we not?” He thought he should be a bit more reserved: “Ahem, is there anything else we need to consider?”

“Let me at least inform my Master. Also, from Gancang Village, they only sent a small group this time; next time, it might not be so simple. If there’s no security, they could be in danger.”

Nan Hua thought about it and nodded. He casually summoned a golden paper crane, “Let the golden crane deliver the message!”

Before Lanlan could say anything, he waved his sleeve, and the entire Lanshan Sect was enveloped by a layer of magical defenses. He even added an extra layer to Wanzhi Mountain: “I’ve restructured the barrier for Lanshan Sect. No matter where I am, I can control it.”

Fearing Lanlan might not understand, he explained, “It’s like setting up surveillance and explosives for Lanshan Sect. I can see all their movements clearly, and if they come again, I can destroy them at any time.”

He previously was indifferent; such a large sect and vast cultivation world couldn’t rely solely on him.

But now, he could hardly ignore it!

Suddenly a thought struck him: “Oh right, my senior brother and sister will be in secluded meditation for about a hundred years; could the ‘Time Mirror’ be useful to them?”

“Of course, the ‘Time Mirror’ is a precious treasure for cultivation, and with it, the training could be twice as effective.”

“Can my senior brother and sister still enter it now?”

He chuckled lightly, “They’ve long been inside the ‘Time Mirror’.”

Lanlan looked at him with surprise, “You?”

“Since they are important to you, I naturally made arrangements. When they entered seclusion, I gave them passes to the ‘Time Mirror’, but I told them it was a suitable hermitage for meditation. Do you have any questions?”

She pressed her lips together, “Since there’s such a treasure, it seems people generally don’t know about it. So, is there a price to pay for using it?”

“Don’t worry, this treasure is my life’s work, and outsiders won’t know its inner workings. As for entry, it depends only on my willingness.”

That seemed fair enough.

“Then why didn’t you stay in there for your meditation before? I remember you said you were meditating in the cave where Tian Ji resides.”

“If I entered, people from the celestial realm would have a hard time finding me. At that point, the West would grow even more rampant. However, this time, I want to ‘lure the snakes out of their holes’ and give it a try.”

“Alright, let’s go then. By the way, can my contract beast, Sisi, accompany us?”

“Of course. And…”

Lanlan looked confused, “And what?”

“My real name is Si Nan; you can call me that from now on.”

He said this with anticipation, hoping to hear her call his real name.

Lanlan moved her lips, but in the end, she merely stammered, “Let’s hurry to the ‘Time Mirror’.”

“...Alright.”

With time ahead of them, after five hundred years of companionship, they had plenty of time.

Eventually, he would think of ways to touch her… no, to move her, then they could get married right there without a hitch, which wasn’t impossible.

The more he thought about it, the more excited he became, and his expression radiated cold aloofness!

Even Lanlan thought he was on high alert, completely unaware that his mind was filled with visions of weddings and baby names!
