**The Battle Begins**

Never had there been a moment when David Wang felt death so close. 

All he could see was a bullet heading right for him, growing larger and larger. In despair, he thought of closing his eyes, but he couldn't move fast enough and could only stare in shock. 

Suddenly, a loud “clang” echoed, and the anticipated pain never came. He saw his guardian, Grace Guan, standing protectively in front of him. David's mind went blank, and soon after, he collapsed on the ground. 

The one-eyed man sneered as he gazed at the steel shield in front of Grace. 

“Oh? Not bad, looks like we have a metal ability user here. Care to join us?” 

“Pfft, I wouldn't stoop to the level of beasts like you.” 

The one-eyed man fumed with anger, “You're asking for it! Don’t blame me for being rude. Boys, let’s make sure you all have a feast!” 

As he spoke, he led his gang outside, conjuring a mound of earth that smashed through the barricade of zombies blocking the door. 

Once they had exited the base, the zombie wall quickly filled in behind them, and the one-eyed man revealed a sadistic grin. 

“Go in and feast! Enjoy yourselves, my darlings!” 

Sitting on his makeshift “throne” made of earth, the others surrounded him—some were throwing small flying knives, while others were playing with flames in their hands. 

They were accustomed to such scenes, having destroyed larger bases many times. With a spectator’s enthusiasm, they glinted with bloodthirst, eager for their feast. 

“Roar~” 

Even the zombies surrounding the base howled in excitement, as if saying, “Finally, we can feast!”

Looking at the swarming zombies around, the people inside the base remained calm. It wasn’t the first time they faced such a large horde. 

Of course, some were actively seeking refuge within the base, particularly the fastest few: 

David, pale-faced, was the first to dash forward, thinking that as long as he could run quickly, the zombies behind him would never catch up. 

All he could hear was the rush of his labored breaths. 

David had been running for what felt like an eternity, yet the scenery around him felt unchanged, as if he were running in place. 

But with zombies closing in behind him, he ran with all his might, fighting against the impending wave of doom. 

“Crack!” 

Suddenly, there was a sharp pain across his face. “Ah! Don’t eat me, please!” 

Wait? There were so many people ahead! 

Instinctively, he shouted, “Zombies are coming, run!” 

In front of him appeared a familiar face that nearly bumped into his, rolling its eyes dramatically at him. 

“David Wang, stop shouting, you’re going to make us all deaf,” out came Clara Joy, who was also digging in her ears. 

“Uh?” 

Feeling himself placed back on solid ground, he finally realized it was Aaron, the tallest among them, who had been lifting him all along. He had felt suspended in mid-air for quite some time! 

Ah! How embarrassing! 

David's chubby hands tried hard to cover his large face. 

“What are you covering for? Everyone knows you already! David the Base Leader!” 

“I’m not! I don’t even dare to claim that title!” 

“Aaron, let’s focus! We have serious matters at hand.” 

“Oh!” 

“Aaron, gather everyone to kill the zombies together, I’ll handle the front gate. There are more zombies than usual coming our way. Just like before, the system will reward us with energy points once we’re done.” 

“Got it! But be careful!” 

“Don’t worry, it’ll take more than these weaklings to cause havoc at my base.” 

Soon, those with abilities, strength, or revenge in their eyes rushed to the front; women, children, and the elderly organized into medical and supply teams, ready to assist and provide support. 

David, along with a few of his followers, stood dumbfounded watching everyone scatter. 

“What should we do, Base Leader?” 

“Stop calling me Base Leader, just call me... Brother David.” 

“Oh, Brother David, what do we do now? They said there are rich rewards for killing zombies, including food and energy points!” 

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!” 

“Go where?” 

“Let’s head to the front gate. How dare that beast try to scare me, not realizing who I am! Come on, get ready.”

“Hey? Why haven’t your little darlings gone in yet?” 

The one-eyed man noticed something amiss. “You two, go check it out.” 

The bald guy and the knife-throwing man exchanged wary glances, cautiously moving forward. Though they could control the zombies, the monsters didn’t care about the smaller fry in their way. 

Bang bang bang… A headless zombie was tossed in front of them. 

They saw more than a dozen ability users, some wielding baseball bats and some... sugarcane? They swiftly dispatched the zombies, forcing the two of them back behind the one-eyed man. 

A petite girl ceased her actions, while the others lined up beside her to keep fighting zombies, clearly showing at least second-level abilities. 

Across from them, the one-eyed man, who looked like he was seated on a throne, watched in disbelief as his zombie army was being halted and killed. He hadn’t expected to encounter such strong resistance. 

A flying knife zoomed toward them, and with a fierce swing of her sugarcane, the petite girl deflected it into a zombie’s head. 

The two locked eyes, one still and one moving, as the number of zombies around them decreased. 

The petite girl, Lanlan Gan, absolutely refused to step outside the base, and for good reason—safety! 

Meanwhile, the opposing team appeared to hesitate, as if any movement might lead to their downfall, showing an absurd form of stubbornness. 

Aaron’s mind raced; he thought they couldn’t lose face and pulled out a cat-claw sofa from his spatial storage. 

Lanlan stared at him, speechless, while he scratched his head, urging her to sit down. They couldn't let their momentum falter! 

“I collected supplies earlier and thought this would suit you, so I brought it along. This is the only one, honestly!” 

Fine, she would begrudgingly sit down; standing for too long was exhausting anyway. 

To her surprise, the sofa was quite comfortable. 

“Hey, Lanlan, have an orange.” 

He pulled an orange from his pocket and started peeling it, apparently having taken it from her house earlier. 

The opposing team seemed genuinely infuriated, aside from the one-eyed man, they all advanced. 

Meanwhile, the others were getting ready to fight back; only Aaron, who couldn’t fight, hung back with the cat-claw chair, cheering them on: 

“Let’s battle, brave sugarcane warriors!” 

“Cough! Cough! I’ve told you a million times not to call us that.” 

As he tossed half of the orange to Aaron, he caught and popped it in his mouth, saying, “This is our local specialty, so we must include it.” 

The people in the base, though not as ferocious as their opponents, were filled with fervor and rage, and with superior numbers, the bald man’s side quickly started to falter. 

Suddenly, a massive clump of dirt came hurtling towards them from a distance, aiming to crush them all. 

“Wow, what a huge… dirt clump!” 

Aaron raised his hand to look, not moving an inch. 

The bald man’s group was still preoccupied with their attacks, but a loud crash made Lanlan cover her ears. 

The one-eyed man, however, seemed to witness something unbelievable and leaped to his feet: 

“This is impossible!”
