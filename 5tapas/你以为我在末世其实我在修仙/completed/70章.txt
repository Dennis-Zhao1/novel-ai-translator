**Shall We Watch a Blockbuster Together?**

"Lanlan, can this stone really record images?"  
"Yes, even though many things in the celestial realm are different from the apocalyptic world, they also share some similarities. I saw this in Master Bro's place before; it should be a combination of a camera and a projector!"  
"Then let's take a look! But this 'broken stone' definitely can't compare to Sisi's Star Network! Hmph!"  
Amused, I comforted Sisi, "Right, our Sisi's Star Network is the best! But since we don't have it right now, let's make do with this 'broken stone,' okay?"  
"Okay!"  
Nodding her little head, her eyes flickered, clearly thinking of something amusing.  

I placed the image stone on the table, used a finger technique to activate it, and the display began!  
A small projector-like image appeared above the stone, providing a decent 360° holographic view!  
Holding some popcorn made from spirit corn, I cuddled with Sisi, sharing a piece at a time, and started to watch the film... or rather, the recording!  

Since it was night, the screen appeared a little dark!  
The camera first panned from above, as the clouds parted, fast-forwarding until two opposing factions finally appeared in confrontation!  
At the border between the Wokou tribe and the celestial realm, many people on both sides seemed to have prepared in advance!  
A few individuals at the front were passionately arguing about the Southern City Battle!  

Celestial realm representative: "You started the slaughter in the Southern City, and you still don't want to admit it?"  
Wokou representative: "You're slandering us!"  
Celestial realm representative: "We have witnesses!"  
Wokou representative: "You’re fabricating accusations!"  
Celestial realm representative: "You dare to do but not to admit, it's simply shameless!"  
Wokou representative: "You're the one slandering!"  
...  
Both sides were heatedly arguing, when suddenly a strong wind blew, sending the Wokou people staggering.  
Looking at the purple figure standing before them, a practitioner exclaimed excitedly, "Lord Nanhua! It's Lord Nanhua!"  
Before the Wokou could regain their footing, they heard a powerful chant:  
"Lord Nanhua!"  
Yet again, they were thrown off balance!  
Once they steadied themselves, they had no choice but to respectfully bow to the purple figure before them!  
Lord Nanhua! A figure they hadn't dared to mention for hundreds of years!  

"What's this? With me absent, you’ve become even more audacious?"  
The people below quickly explained, "We wouldn't dare, Lord! There must be some misunderstanding!"  
"Oh?"  
"Lord, you can't just take their word for it and decide it's us who are to blame, can you?"  
Nanhua nodded, "Indeed!"  

As he spoke, a majestic armchair appeared behind him, and he boldly sat down. One hand rested on the armrest, and the other supported his chin as he quietly watched them.  
The practitioners behind the floating man wanted to step forward and argue, but the floating man stopped them.  
They might not know, but he was aware that Lord Nanhua had given strict orders regarding this negotiation:  
If they didn’t admit it, they should be made to submit!  
So, they might as well enjoy the show!  

The atmosphere became tense and quiet, and those below nervously watched the opposing camp:  
"Lord, we hope you can be fair!"  
Unimpressed, Nanhua simply replied, "Naturally!"  
With an implied glance at the floating man, he clearly didn’t want to waste words on them!  
He still needed to think about how to explain things later to the child...  

Just as the people below were about to breathe a sigh of relief, the floating man stood up again:  
"Ha! Do you dare say that the Southern City Battle was not instigated by you?"  
Perhaps because Lord Nanhua was there, the morale of the people below had weakened considerably:  
"War is nothing significant; you’ve also attacked our Wokou..."  
As he spoke, he discreetly glanced at the person sitting in thought, as the main character of that battle was this very deity!  
"So you admit it!"  
"We..."  
"Great, since you admit it! Now let me state my second point!"  

"Wait a second, I haven't even said anything, how can that be an admission?"  
"After the battle of the Southern City, the original residents and practitioners were basically slaughtered, and the Southern City turned into a dead city! As far as I know, nearly 80% of your Wokou participants from that year are still alive, enjoying the best treatment from the nation. Isn’t that true?"  
"Our warriors are heroes, they returned victorious, and what’s wrong with the nation rewarding them? Besides, the Southern City is still very prosperous!"  
The floating man intensified his tone:  
"I’m asking whether the Southern City became a dead city after the war, isn’t that the case?"  
"...I wasn't in that battle, how would I know about your nation’s affairs?"  
The floating man was so incensed by the shameless words that he couldn’t help but shout:  
"You don’t know anything, yet you’re trying to argue? Bring forth those who participated in the Southern City Battle—the butchers and cowards!"  
The people below continued to argue, "They are warriors; you can’t just slander our warriors!"  
"Slander? Go look at those 21 survivors; they are the result of your infamous butchers! Don’t want to admit it?"  
"Fine, let those beasts come face-to-face with us! Let them swear before everyone: if they ever slaughtered and burned in the Southern City, let them suffer more than death for all eternity!"  
"You... you are going too far..."  
At a loss for words, the people below could only feign weakness and seek help!  
"Lord, they are being aggressive! They want to force us to admit it!"  
At last, Lord Nanhua finally lifted his eyes to glance at them:  
"Oh? You don’t want to admit it?"  

The individuals below were filled with dread as Lord Nanhua clearly favored the opposing side, feeling greatly insulted. Filled with anger, one of them shouted at Lord Nanhua:  
"I respect you as the most honorable person in the celestial realm, but you can’t just slander us like they do!"  
Calmly, Lord Nanhua responded, "What’s your name?"  
Just as the individual was about to open his mouth, Lord Nanhua raised his right hand, stopping him.  
"It doesn’t matter!"  
"..."  
"Three hundred years ago, your Wokou invaded our borders multiple times and was destroyed by me."  
Furrowing his attractive brows, he remarked, "Wasn't it at Mount Dang?"  
Hearing the words "Mount Dang," the individuals below couldn't help but tremble!  
That was the most devastating war for their Wokou!  
"Thirty thousand of your practitioners and soldiers, oh, and some ridiculous ghosts."  
As he spoke, he raised his stunning hand and made a fist gesture:  
"I could crush them with a single grip! 'Bang!' and they were gone! Do you want to give it another try today?"  
Opening his palm, he slowly extended his hand forward.  
The people below were frightened and retreated:  
"Lord, you can't do this..."  
"Who says I can’t?"  
Partially clenched fist!  
"Ah~"  
"It hurts!"  
"Ah, it hurts so much!"  
Lord Nanhua dealt the Wokou people a "collective amputation" treatment!  
Oh, he spared one: Shanxia!  
This one was still useful!  
The cries of agony echoed in his ears as warm liquid splattered on his face!  
Shanxia's legs couldn't help but tremble!  
He wanted to turn back, but he couldn’t!  
He wanted to run, but he knew escape was hopeless!  
"I'll give you an incense stick’s worth of time to bring those who fought in the battle over!"  

The floating man, who appeared round, was surprisingly agile at that moment!  
He quickly moved to Lord Nanhua's side, holding a burning incense stick! And he said,  
"Shanxia, please!"  
"Lord, you can’t...! This is a blatant violation of diplomatic protocols!"  
"I won’t say it twice!"  
With a flick of his finger, Shanxia vanished from the spot!  
He was sent back to his homeland! Shanxia looked at the familiar street, filled with dread, and rushed toward the palace!  
*  
"Lord, what if they don’t come?"  
Lord Nanhua maintained his indifferent tone:  
"Does it make any difference?"  
The floating man's expression changed; yes! As long as Lord Nanhua, who could do anything, was present, did it matter whether they came or not?  
If things came to that, Lord Nanhua could simply lead them in a charge!  
After an incense stick's time, the Wokou Emperor and Shanxia appeared at the front with several subordinates, looking grim!  
They were all quite young, clearly not having brought those people along!  
Wokou Emperor: "Lord, I am the Wokou Emperor! As for your summons, it cannot be accomplished in this short time. As compensation, please tell us what you desire, and we shall offer it wholeheartedly!"  
Casting a glance at them, just that look left the Wokou Emperor feeling like mere dust! Even dirty dust at that!  
Lord Nanhua closed his eyes, these people would only waste his time!  
At that moment, the floating man dropped the incense stick and spat at them:  
"Heh, can’t gather them? Or do you not wish to summon them?"  
Shanxia hurried to clarify: "It really is too late."  
The floating man mocked:  
"You can't gather even a single person? I see, you aren’t fit to be Wokou Emperor!"  
Wokou Emperor: "..."  
So furious but powerless to fight back!  
"I’m tired! This farce should come to an end!"  
With a snap of his fingers, the previously empty sky projected an image of a brutal slaughter!  
It was vividly the Southern City Massacre, the scene was horrific!  
The floating man and his group looked excitedly at the sky; this was Lord Nanhua’s "Time Reversal" technique!  
Something that ordinary people could not accomplish, Lord Nanhua truly deserved his title!  
As they watched, the people from the celestial side had reddened eyes, itching to dive into the opposing camp and eliminate them all!  
Meanwhile, the Wokou Emperor and Shanxia could only remain silent in the face of such irrefutable evidence!  
"Now, do you have anything else to say?"
