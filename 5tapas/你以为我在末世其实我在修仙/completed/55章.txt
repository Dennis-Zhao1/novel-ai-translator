### Vengeful Encounter

As they watched their junior sister smile so sweetly, a few others from the group gathered around. Originally, they thought their idol's complaint about the clay figure was valid; little did they expect…

The usually aloof and quiet Nan Hua, under the skillful hands of Clay Zhang, was now laughing so brightly, resembling a sunny boy!

The crowd surrounding them had also heard the earlier murmurs: Clay Zhang had the uncanny ability to see into people's innermost selves!

So this was the true nature of the immortal…?

Ginger Lanlan raised her "Mud Immortal" figurine and laughed, "Hehe, this representation is quite rare! It's way more fun than my own! I’ll take this one!"

After thanking Clay Zhang, she turned to her companions, "Brothers and sisters, our clay figures are done, and the crowd is growing—let’s head back!"

Seeing their junior sister genuinely happy, they didn't object.

"Alright then, let’s go!"

Everyone left with their clay figurines, exchanging looks and comments at the various unique shapes. Even the clay figures from Weiba Village had an endearing quality!

Clay Zhang's craftsmanship truly lived up to its reputation!

As they walked, they encountered a shimmering figure approaching, nearly blinding the group!

Indeed, they weren’t mistaken—the "glittering" man was flanked by a group of toadies, casually picking his teeth while casting shifty glances all around.

He was clearly a nouveau riche, decked out head to toe in gold, eager for the entire world to know just how wealthy he was!

As they brushed past each other, the golden figure leered, "Hey, where did these two pretty ladies come from? Tonight… hehe!"

Ginger Lanlan squinted, finding something familiar about the golden pig emblem on the man’s chest. 

“That man’s gold pig pendant looks a bit familiar!” she exclaimed.

Glancing back, Lin Yu followed her gaze, "Junior sister, what’s up?"

"Nothing! Let’s go!" she replied.

"Oh!"

That night, a finger punctured the paper window of the inn, followed by a bamboo tube stretching through the hole, releasing a puff of enchanting smoke!

“Big brother, they’re all passed out.”

“Well done! Let’s go, tonight… hehe!”

*

The next morning, the inn’s attendant was cheerily opening up shop!

"Ah! Boss, bad news!"

"What’s all this racket? Don’t wake the guests!"

"There are some corpses hanging at the entrance…!"

"What? Hurry, take me to see!"

Indeed, several pants-less figures dangled at the inn’s entrance, but they were not corpses: rather, they were battered and bruised, made public spectacles. By now, the entire Fan City probably knew who they were.

“Fortunately, they’re not dead.”

This commotion drew a crowd interested in the spectacle.

"Boss, what happened here?"

"I have no clue; they were already hanging here this morning!"

Someone nearby recognized them. “Aren't those Huang Da and his crew?”

"You know them?"

“I came to Fan City with them, but they are no good. They bully the weak, commit arson, and are guilty of all kinds of wrongdoings. Without proof, they'd be worthy of execution.”

“Wow…”

“Then this time, did they offend one of your guests? Otherwise, they wouldn’t be hanging here.”

“Uh…”

“Boss, why is there so much commotion this early?”

Lin Yu and his group were also awakened by the noise below. How could he miss out on the action?

“Dear guest, we’re not sure who hung these people at the inn’s entrance. The attendant just went to report it to the authorities.”

“Oh~ Boss, prepare some breakfast for us, we need to be on our way!”

“Right away, dear guest, please hold on!”

*

“Hahaha~ Oh, you're killing me! Junior sister, you had the best idea! Hahaha!”

Once Ginger Lanlan and the others left Fan City, Lin Yu couldn’t contain his laughter any longer; it was a challenge holding it in for so long!

Wei Baocun expressed his confusion at the immortal laughing but found no issue joining in with his simple grin, “Hehe!”

However, they hadn’t gone far when, despite being somewhat restrained in their powers, they sensed something unusual around them.

“Junior sister, someone is following us.”

“Had a feeling.”

Seeing Ginger Lanlan appear somewhat gloomy since last night, Wen Zhi held her hand and asked, “Junior sister, something on your mind?”

Ginger Lanlan remained silent, leaving Wen Zhi helplessly gazing at her older brother for assistance. 

Sadly, although her brother was mighty, he couldn’t read minds.

“Do you know those people from last night?”

Everyone was stunned and turned toward Nan Hua, who sat up straight with an inquiry.

“What you did last night was to lure them here. Do you have a grudge against them?”

Ginger Lanlan bit her lip and nodded.

“That gold pig pendant hanging from Huang Da’s neck was specially made for me by my father.”

“So, junior sister… are they the ones who burned down your family?”

“Mmhmm.”

Lin Yu, driving the carriage, couldn’t restrain his fury, “Had I known, we should have struck harder!”

Wen Gu also folded his fan, “No worries! We’ll meet again shortly.”

Sure enough, it wasn’t long before Huang Da and over a dozen burly men blocked their way.

“Stop! You think you can run after fighting me? You should've checked who Huang Da is!”

With that, he slapped his massive three-meter-long blade against the side of the carriage.

“Run? You want to run? You’re the ones I caught! Hurry down! The men on the left, the women on the right!”

Wei Baocun, aware of the brewing danger, saw that the immortals seemed quite compliant, so he chose to remain silent!

“Speak! Was it you who beat me up?”

Ginger Lanlan gestured for her seniors not to intervene and stepped forward, nodding, “Yes! It was us who left you battered and exposed for all to see! Everyone in Fan City now knows who you are! No need to thank me!”

One of the other thugs, nursing his own bruises, leaned in and asked, “Boss, does she mean we’re getting famous? So everyone in Fan City will know who we are?”

"Uh, seems like that’s what she’s saying. After all, my magnificent figure deserves to be admired!"

Although their voices weren’t loud, everyone heard and shared a quiet moment of disbelief.

"… how uneducated can one be!"

“Then, Boss, should we still kill them?”

“Ha! After they beat me, they think they can still get away? The women are to be taken; the men can be discarded.”

Ginger Lanlan could hardly watch anymore: “Excuse me over there! It's well-known that ‘appearance and demeanor’ usually refers to the deceased, not the living.”

“What do you mean, Boss?” one thug asked in confusion.

“Meaning… I have no idea what she’s talking about!” the boss retorted angrily, kicking at the confused lackey. 

“What are you waiting for? Get them!”

“Oh, right! Brothers, charge!”

Ginger Lanlan smiled, producing a sugar cane from her space pouch.

“Leave these people to me, please refrain from intervening.”

“Junior sister, be careful!”

In no time, several figures lay scattered on the ground, groaning in pain.

Who would have thought that this delicate-looking young woman could fight so fiercely! 

Now, those thugs were either nursing broken arms or legs.

Their boss fared even worse—a pig-headed face with not just a broken arm but leg as well! He now resembled a yellow “pancake”!

Even Lin Yu marveled, having never seen such a fiercely competent junior sister before!

There was a fierce aura about her—yet oddly likable!

As Ginger Lanlan approached while holding the golden pig pendant, the thugs cowered, whimpering and retreating.

“Heroine, spare us! Heroine, spare us!”
