**The Howling Wolves and the Prone Heads**

The wolves gathered around, an echo of howls filling the air.

"I ask, you answer. Don’t dare to deceive me!" 

Waving a piece of sugarcane, she asked, "Understand?" 

The onlookers trembled, truly afraid... "Yes, heroic lady, we will tell you everything! We dare not tell a single lie!" 

"Was it you who set fire to Gan's family?" 

“No, no… Yes, yes! But it’s not our fault... It was Huang who ordered us to do it. We just knocked them out, took their money, and left. Huang started the fire!" 

Gazing at the unconscious Huang, Gan Lanlan kicked him again. 

"Spare me, heroic lady, spare me!" 

"Rest assured, I won’t kill anyone!" 

* 

"Junior Sister, we’ve buried them well!" 

After patting his hands, Lin Yu looked at the unconscious figures planted in the ground. It was finally his turn to take action! 

But… 

"Junior Sister, are we really letting them go like this?" 

"Yes, this is enough!" 

Having been hurt so badly and now buried with only their heads showing, it was an isolated location. With darkness approaching, they would likely not have a good ending! 

"Let’s go!" 

Lin Yu wanted to say more, but his elder brother stopped him. 

The group continued on their horse-drawn cart, but as he noticed something flash outside the window and Wen Gu still hadn’t retracted his hand: 

"Elder brother, did you drop something?" 

Calmly lowering the curtain, Wen Gu smiled, "It’s nothing, let’s keep going!" 

* 

With only their heads exposed, the men watched as the cart vanished into the distance, finally letting out a sigh of relief. 

They had nearly thought they were going to die! 

"Ha ha ha ha~ ha ha ha ha!" 

Waking up to find he was still alive, Huang suddenly laughed maniacally! 

"Boss… are you okay?" 

Only heads remained, and he was still laughing—terrifying! 

Huang's eyes turned fierce, "Ha ha ha, I'm still alive! As long as I’m alive, I will kill them one day!" 

"But Boss, we can’t get out now!" 

"Hmph, just wait~" 

He had a backup plan; it really hurt! 

Getting ready to rest his eyes, he realized he had been seriously injured. If he hadn’t played dead, that little lady would have likely killed him! 

“B-b-b-boss, o-o-ok now?” 

“Shut up! I’m just…” 

As he looked around, a pair of green eyes surrounded them, Huang’s eyes widened! 

"Wolves, it’s a pack of wolves! Boss, what do we do? I don't want to die!" 

"I don’t want to die either!" 

Some people looked to Huang for hope: 

"Boss, you’re usually so powerful, think of a way!" 

"I’m like this, what can I think of!" 

One person started crying out for help: 
"…Help! Is anyone there?!" 

"Yes, yes… scream for help! Help! Is anyone there? Save me!" 

Others had likely lost their minds, muttering nonsensically: 
"Wa-wa, I don’t want to die. I have a sixty-year-old mother and a six-year-old child..." 

"…Li, your mother ran off ages ago, and you haven't even married! Where’s your child?" 

“Shut up! What’s wrong with crying a bit?” 

“Oh!” 

“Help!” 

The wolves observed calmly, waiting to consume them, as they had come at their summoning! 

The heads shrieked in despair, struggling only intensified their helplessness! Indeed, those who are pitiful must also have their flaws! 

The wolves gathered, beholding the strikingly surreal scene of howling heads! 
"Boss, look up… in the sky! Fire, fire!" 

"What do you mean by…?" 

With great difficulty, the people raised their heads to see a fiery mass descending from the sky… no, it truly was fire falling! 

"Ah!!" 

As the fire landed, the wolves felt the threat and retreated! 

By the time they circled back, the heads had vanished! 

All that remained was a burnt scent. 

The lead wolf sneezed, sending up a cloud of black smoke. 

It seemed there would be no meal tonight. Children, let’s head home! 

“Awoo!” 

Deep into the night, a group of people arrived where the wolves had passed. 

"Boss, we didn’t see Huang and the others." 

"Damn it, didn’t they promise to bring me something good today? How dare they trick me!" 

"Yes, if it weren’t for the boss helping them placate the officials, they would still be locked up! Could they have robbed that group and fled?" 

"Hehe, he could do that. Or maybe they offended someone they shouldn’t have. After all, those people don’t seem to be ordinary characters! They better not be messing with their own demise!" 

I’m sorry, they’ve already self-destructed! Right under your feet! 

"What should we do now?" 

“Let’s go back! I’m not like them; I’ve got my principles! They paid us, we fulfilled our agreement; it’s not a waste of a trip! Let’s go!” 

"Alright, Boss!" 

* 

"We wasted some time today, and it’s too late to find an inn, so let’s camp for the night." 

Wen Gu said as he glanced at the idol. 

But the idol didn’t react, so he assumed it was a silent approval! 

“Okay, Elder Brother!” 

Finding a decent cave, they began to set up camp. Although the cart had amenities, they were here for training and needed to experience life! 

Key point: they couldn’t let their idol think they were on vacation! 

No, they had a mission and were willing to endure hardships! 

Knowing everyone was busy, Wen Zhi stealthily approached: 
"Brother, what did you do to those people?" 

After all, he didn’t think her elder brother would easily let go of Junior Sister’s "enemies"! 

He chuckled lightly, not hiding anything from Wen Zhi: 
"I’ve invited some little cuties; I’m sure they will enjoy tonight’s meal!" 

There was nothing to conceal from his own sister. 

Everyone was bustling about; Gan Lanlan even roasted a whole lamb! 

The ingredients, of course, were brought down from the mountain. 

Everyone ate happily, even Grandpa Nan Hua had his fair share! 

Late at night, Gan Lanlan felt she had eaten a bit too much and couldn’t sleep! 

Climbing outside, gazing at the moon, there was a unique flavor to it. 

"This moonlight is lovely tonight!" 

"Sir, you too… came out to enjoy the moon?" Perhaps he also overate? 

Immortal Nan Hua mimicked Gan Lanlan’s position, staring up at the moon. 

"Yes! Pretty wine with luminous cups~ Want a drink?" 

To her surprise, a small table with grape wine and luminous cups had already been meticulously prepared nearby! 

However, it turned out the master even knew the "Liangzhou Verse"! 

This world was indeed a bit magical! 

"I abstain from alcohol!" After thinking for a moment, afraid of being misunderstood by the immortal, she quickly explained: "I’m allergic to alcohol!" 

"Yes! It’s good that young ladies don’t drink." 

Immortal Nan Hua was not difficult with her and continued sipping his wine! 

Wen Zhi was worried about her little junior sister, only to see the harmonious picture of the two: one drinking and the other admiring the moon! 

After contemplating, she retreated. 

"You are still too soft-hearted." 

"Sir…" 

"Those people were not good either; even if you had killed them, it would be nothing more than eradicating a harm to society." 

"…I understand." 

"But you still can’t bring yourself to do it! You prefer to let them be and keep a sliver of hope." 

Gan Lanlan said nothing, acquiescing to his words! 

Though he didn’t turn around, one could imagine the little girl in a daze, probably lost in thought staring at the moon! 

Wanting to comfort the little girl, he opened his mouth, knowing not what to say. 

"It’s late; be careful not to catch a cold, go and rest!" 

"Yes, what about you, Sir?" 

"I’ll return once I finish my drink. You go ahead!" 

With a slender hand gently grasping, a small flame appeared in his palm! 

The little flame jumped cheerfully, seeming to say: I’ve completed the task, sir! 

As he closed his palm, the flame disappeared! 

Watching her retreat into the cave, he emptied his glass: 
"Things you’re unwilling to do, I will take upon myself!"
