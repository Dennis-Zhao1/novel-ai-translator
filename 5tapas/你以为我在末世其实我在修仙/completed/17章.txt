**Title: Sugarcane Paradise**

“Hey, there’s nothing impossible! You’re just ignorant!” 

A mound of dirt was blocked by a wall of sugarcane, which seemed to thrive on the very soil itself, growing even faster. The dirt mound dissipated into nothing, absorbed completely by the sugarcane; to the canes, it was a significant energy boost!

The one-eyed man’s expression darkened, but he had a backup plan: earth escape. He intended to emerge from the ground and catch the woman sitting in the cushioned chair off guard. He envisioned the distance he'd travel; once he burst forth from the soil, he would have his way with her.

“Thud!” 

Ouch! He must have hit his head. He hadn't emerged yet—this patch of dirt must be tougher than he expected! 

Trying again, he shifted his position and went for another “thud.” He couldn’t believe it; he was still stuck! 

“Thud, thud, thud, thud…” 

Until he felt something tugging at his neck, and his view shifted from the familiar darkness of soil to a row of sugarcane surrounding him. He found himself trapped in a square enclosure made of sugarcane, with one side completely made of glass, reminiscent of a zoo.

Although neither sugarcane nor glass was indestructible, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t break free. 

“Claire, this sugarcane cage is quite impressive—a beast in a cage, if you ask me.” 

On hearing this, David Wang, his companion, gritted his teeth, utterly unable to comprehend how they could consume human flesh! 

“Let’s keep him locked up for now. Come on, we need to help the base—I’ve never seen so many zombies before!” 

As night enveloped the horizon, after the last zombie fell, everyone embraced and cheered, disregarding their injuries and exhaustion. Some even laughed until they cried, kneeling to the starry sky, lost in thoughts of mourning and remembrance.

Brushing away a tear, Clara Joy observed the community, more united than ever after their first major ordeal.

“Everyone, you've worked hard! Today’s energy rewards will be credited as assessed. Additionally, all public areas like the dining hall, bathhouse, and hospital will be open for you free of charge. Tomorrow, we’ll each receive a free care package. Now, please head back. David, could you arrange tonight’s patrols? Everyone else, you’re dismissed!” 

Just then, someone shouted, “Thank you, Princess Sweetheart!” 

“Thank you, Clara!” 

“Thank you, Princess Sweetheart!” 

A chorus erupted, drowning any dissent with cheers. 

Clara Joy felt herself spiraling into madness, glaring at David Wang before fleeing the scene. 

Behind her, laughter erupted, breaking the previous somber atmosphere and sparking joy, tears glimmering in everyone’s eyes. 

Without looking back, Clara couldn't help but let a smile slip.

In the base, children followed David Wang around, inspecting the plentiful sugarcane, munching on small pieces while toting tiny baskets for trash. Even in a post-apocalyptic world, they maintained cleanliness—what well-behaved kids!

“Brother David, why do we call this the Sugarcane Base? Why not 'Era of Peace', 'Sunny City,' or even 'Forbidden City'?” 

“Ha! The Forbidden City? Your Princess Clara wouldn’t dare to name it that—she's too timid! As for why we call it Sugarcane Community, it’s because your sister Clara loves sugarcane!” 

Another little girl piped up, “Is Sister Clara the owner of the community, like a princess from a fairy tale? Like the Princess and the Pea?” 

“Hm? Sounds right! She’s our princess! Protecting all of us, so we need to protect her too, right?” 

A little boy chimed in, “Shouldn’t we call her ‘Princess Sugarcane,’ just like the Princess and the Pea?” 

The girls pouted, “No way! Princess Sugarcane sounds terrible!” 

David’s eyes twinkled as he thought, “Haha! That’s true! So children, do you think sugarcane is sweet?” 

The munching kids replied gleefully, “Sweet!”, “Super sweet!”, “Sugar-sweet!”… 

“Then we should call Clara ‘Princess Sweetheart’! What do you think?” 

“Princess Sweetheart? Yay! Sounds great, so sweet!” 

“Princess Sweetheart~” 

And thus, thanks to David and the enthusiastic kids, Clara was bestowed a new title: “Princess Sweetheart.” 

All because the sugarcane was just too sweet!

As David Wang trembled nervously while attending the meeting, he dared not refer to himself as the base's master—he wished he could crawl into a sugarcane grove and hide away. 

Following the battle, everyone recognized Clara Joy as the true leader of the base. Though she appeared young and harmless, her innocence was incredibly deceptive. 

David had to admit he’d been fooled; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so rash in his actions. 

During the debrief, he became an echo, nodding to everything everyone said and agreed, “You’re all correct, that’s brilliant!” 

Glancing at him, Clara couldn’t help but roll her eyes. 

“David, from now on, you’ll handle all affairs of the base, big and small. Any objections?” 

“Uh... no, no objections… What?!”

David couldn’t believe what he was hearing. 

Clara chuckled lightly, “Alright then, this meeting is adjourned. Everyone, thank you for your hard work in maintaining our community.” 

As he stepped outside, David couldn’t grasp how he’d been spared punishment, not only allowed to continue working—but secretly, even flourishing. 

“Clara, what exactly are you thinking about David?” 

“He’s good with internal matters; since he’s around, your dad doesn’t bear the brunt of them anymore. He may have ambitions, but he gets results. After this incident, I believe he’ll see things clearly; if not, we can always drive him away.” 

David could only give a thumbs-up to Clara. 

“And the one-eyed man?” 

“Just keep him locked up—no food or drinks!” 

What followed was entirely up to them. 

Though they had just endured a fierce battle, the base welcomed new people and information from the outside world. 

Indeed, it was the group of girls rescued from the one-eyed man. Many inhabitants had been unaware of the inhumane treatment they had faced, too caught up in their complaints over trivial issues like lack of water or electricity. 

They were fortunate, indeed, even if life had become a bit harder than before. 

At least from the very start, they were living… like real humans.
