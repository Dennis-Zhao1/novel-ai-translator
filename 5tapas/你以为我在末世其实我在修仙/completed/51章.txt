**The Fairy Who Touched a Young Girl's Hand**

"What kind of old man is this? He comes out and immediately grabs the girl's hand!"

【Lanlan, what's wrong? Which old man touched your hand? Let me out, I'll scratch him to death!】 

But as the warmth spread from the back of her hand to her entire body, she felt her spiritual energy being stirred, and she couldn't move!

What kind of person can so easily manipulate someone else's spiritual energy?

With a casual wave of his large hand holding her small one, the vines that had trapped them slowly dissipated until they vanished completely.

Without the vines to obstruct their view, a beam of natural light shone down from above, illuminating the entire space.

At that moment, Gan Lanlan suddenly understood!

Oh, it turns out that the South Hua Fairy was borrowing her spiritual energy! Even though he was just borrowing strength, she could still feel that he was very powerful!

However, he couldn’t just keep holding her hand like this!

【Um, Sisi is fine; it's South Hua Fairy! He's using my spiritual energy to fend off the enemy! Don't worry, everything's fine! The Fairy is the founder of my sect and will protect us!】

【In that case, Lanlan, you still need to be careful! If anything happens, hurry up and let Sisi out! Sisi is very powerful now!】

【Okay, okay, you just rest well!】

But with the enemy gone, he could surely let go now, right?

Just as Gan Lanlan was about to shake off that large hand, he let go voluntarily.

"Sorry for the trouble!"

"Um... it's fine!"

Well, considering he helped to fend off the enemy, I accept your apology!

"South Hua! South Hua! You can't leave, you can’t leave! You have to stay here with me! You promised me~ You promised me!"

With the vines gone, the green spiritual energy became even more noticeable and conspicuous!

Of course, the piercing shouts were incessant, making Gan Lanlan unable to resist rubbing her ears.

Seeing South Hua Fairy take a few steps forward, Wen Zhi jogged over to Gan Lanlan’s side and asked in a low voice, "Junior Sister, are you alright?"

Gan Lanlan glanced at the figure ahead and shook her head. "I'm fine!"

"Vine Princess, don’t be so stubborn! Let’s go, leave this place, and go where you belong!"

"No, no, no! I won’t leave! I just want to be with you, South Hua! We’ve been together for hundreds of years, isn’t that great? Huh? South Hua~ South Hua~"

"This Vine Princess feels like a madwoman," Gan Lanlan whispered to Wen Zhi.

Wen Zhi shot her a look, shaking her head to signal Junior Sister to keep quiet.

This must be a trace of divine soul, but she was certainly not someone they could compare with.

Just with its ability to control the vines, even the three of them together might not be able to handle it.

Watching the entangled Vine Princess, South Hua Fairy also seemed a bit annoyed.

"I think you misunderstand. I’m just weary of the outside world and found a place to rest. This is the sacred ground of my sect. If we’re to be precise, you've intruded into my meditation space. Had it not been for the fact that you didn’t harm anyone, would I have let you stay? If you do not leave, don’t blame me for being ruthless."

"No… you can’t do this to me! Is it because of them? Is it because of them?"

"It's because they came, and you don’t want me anymore… then I'll kill them, and you can be with me forever."

"Yes, I want to kill them, kill them!"

The green light surged, the spiritual energy exploded, and the air grew heavy without any wind.

Both sisters could feel the chaos in the space; it felt like the air was being squeezed, making it hard to breathe.

However, all of this ended with a wave of South Hua Fairy's sleeve!

The wind stopped, the green light, which was the Vine Princess, quickly dimmed and disappeared, leaving Gan Lanlan in shock!

Shouldn’t the Vine Princess be desperately shouting "I'll be back!" at this moment?

"What are you still dawdling for? Let’s go!"

Well, I thought too much! The great master is decisive; there’s not even any sound when he eliminates someone!

The two sisters looked at the sugarcane bridge forming beneath their feet and then glanced at the retreating figure. They couldn’t help but think that, as expected of the Fairy, he was truly all-powerful.

They hurried to catch up!

*

Master Qingyang had just finished setting up the formation, thinking that success or failure depended on this moment!

Then, a slender figure emerged from the swirling light!

Clad in blue, he was strikingly handsome!

But crucially, he looked quite familiar!

Master Xuanching and the others were excited: "South Hua Fairy!"

Oh, so this was the person they were trying to rescue.

Lin Yu and the others hurriedly bowed, "South Hua Fairy!"

Before Master Qingyang could cast his spell, he rushed forward to ask the Fairy if he had seen his two precious disciples.

Fortunately, behind South Hua Fairy, two figures, one in pink and one in purple, appeared.

"Junior Brother/Sister, are you both alright?"

"We’re fine."

"Junior Sister, did you know? Both Master and Senior Brother couldn’t get in; I was so anxious! What happened in there? Why did it take you so long to come out?"

Looking at the tense situation around, "Senior Brother, let’s talk about this when we get back."

"Oh~"

"Two disciples, come quickly and pay your respects to South Hua Fairy."

"Respectfully greet South Hua Fairy!"

"Respectfully greet South Hua Fairy!"

Gan Lanlan lifted her head, finally seeing South Hua Fairy’s appearance clearly.

How to put it, he was neither an old man nor a middle-aged man!

From a visage perspective, he seemed to be around the same age as her Senior Brother. Of course, one couldn't assume he was actually young.

If Gan Lanlan had to describe him, he wasn’t in the "uniform white robes" like those in fantasy dramas; he instead had his unique style.

It was reminiscent of the elegant heroes from Hong Kong films, a white base layered with a purple gauze.

The seemingly simple outfit was just right! In any case, Gan Lanlan couldn’t help but look at him a little longer!

As for the others, they had to stare! This was their idol!

"The Fairy has finally come out! I, for one, wasn't able to assist the Fairy previously. This time, I intended to invite Master Qingyang. However, they also couldn’t get in, leaving these two young girls in danger. I’m truly ashamed!"

While speaking, he glanced inside but saw nothing:

"Fairy, what is the situation inside? Why can’t we enter?"

South Hua Fairy was rather agreeable:

"This is where I was meditating. It was simply a trace of the divine soul that intruded. She has been cultivating in the cave for many years, and I didn’t bother with her. This time, she attempted to trap me, and I have already eliminated her."

Considering a moment, he glanced at Gan Lanlan and the others:

"Which mountain range do these two girls belong to?"

Master Qingyang hurriedly stepped forward: "Replying to the Fairy, they are disciples of my Wanzhi Mountain."

"Mm, good!"

Although he didn’t know why the Fairy thought that was good, since the Fairy said so, it surely meant the two disciples had great potential!

Thinking this, Master Qingyang's eyebrows raised in joy, and he quickly bowed:

"Thank you, Fairy, for praising my disciples!"

He was happier than when he praised himself!

Finally, Master Xuanching and others had a chance to speak:

"Fairy, in recent years, demonic creatures have been rampant outside. We, being less than capable, would request the Fairy to oversee this matter."

"No need, it has long been anticipated. We’ll talk more when we return!"

"Understood!"

As the group boarded the celestial ship for their return journey, the masters and disciples finally had the chance to sit down and converse properly.

No one noticed that the South Hua Fairy, originally intending to meditate, was staring at his tightly clasped hand…

In a daze!!!
