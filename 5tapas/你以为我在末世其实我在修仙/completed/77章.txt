**The Great Battle: The Conclusion**

“Let’s do this!”

Thus, the battle between the Western Demon Clan and the Eastern Celestial Realm began at the gates of Lanshan Sect!

Heavens and earth trembled as wind, fire, thunder, and cannons roared, filling the once-peaceful Lanshan Sect with thick smoke.

And for every celestial being impacted by the Soul-Eating Monster, their souls were damaged and they could not move.

“It’s them! It’s them…”

Lin Yu, assigned by Master Qingyang to guard Sugarcane Village, looked at the agitated villagers behind the protective shield and asked in confusion, “Village Chief, who are they?”

“Celestial Master, I recognize them. That black monster is the one! The celestial masters from South City were killed by them!”

Lin Yu was shocked. “What?”

“The Soul-Eating Monsters? So that’s what it is! No wonder!”

Hearing this familiar voice, Lin Yu turned abruptly towards the sound. When he saw the four people appearing before him, he exclaimed, “Junior Sister, Celestial Lord, Senior Brother, Senior Sister,” and couldn’t help but rub his eyes. “I can’t be dreaming!”

Meanwhile, the equally stunned voice from Wei Baocun called out, “It’s the Celestial Lord! The Celestial Lord and the Celestial Masters have returned!”

Ah, it’s real!

Wen Gu waved his folding fan, saying, “Yu’er, long time no see!”

Wen Zhi smiled, “Yu’er, Senior Sister is back.”

The South Hua Celestial Lord merely nodded, while Gan Lanlan said, “Junior Brother, quickly wipe your tears.”

Lin Yu was utterly aggrieved: “Waa, you finally came back! Hurry and save Master!”

Just as Master Qingyang and the others were immobilized and about to be attacked by the lycanthropes on the ground—

“Who dares to harm my Master?”

Seeing his eldest and second disciples descending from the sky, Master Qingyang felt relieved. 

With just one swing of Wen Gu’s fan, a multitude of demons and monsters were sent crashing to the ground.

“Master, are you alright?”

“I’m fine, Gu’er, Zhi Zhi. I’m not in any real danger. By the way, how did you manage to get out of seclusion? And your cultivation level…”

Master Qingyang could clearly sense that the strength of the two disciples was beyond what he could see through.

“Master, it’s a long story. Once we defeat the enemy, we’ll explain everything to you. You should rest for now; we can handle this.”

“Alright, alright!”

Suddenly, a hauntingly long “ow… ow…” came from the sky, as if calling something.

The South Hua Celestial Lord and Gan Lanlan looked into the distance to see hordes of enemies emerging from all directions, slowly moving, fearless of death. Though they were not particularly strong, their sheer numbers were overwhelming.

They exchanged glances. “Zombies!”

Gan Lanlan frowned. “Look at how these zombies are dressed; they appear to be from our Eastern borders. These people truly stop at nothing and are shameless!”

“Lan’er, don’t be angry. Now that we’re here, we can’t let them run rampant. It’s a good chance for them to test their abilities.”

He stepped forward and gently embraced her. “Today is your battleground, and I will ensure the safety of these people. Remember, I’m right behind you! Go!”

After taking two steps back, he smiled at her, encouraging, “Go on, make some noise! I’ve got your back!”

“Alright!”

“Si Si, this time we fight side by side.”

【Got it, Lanlan!】

Si Si grew larger, and Gan Lanlan sat sideways atop Si Si, soaring towards the battlefield.

“You guys see that? What is that?”

A vast expanse of purple shrouded the sky.

Whether from the Eastern Celestial Realm or the Western Demon Clan, they couldn’t help but look up.

Then they saw it—the Western Demon Clan was being copied!

For every demon dragon, a matching purple dragon appeared opposite it!

For every dark magician, there stood an identical “Amethyst” silhouette across from them!

Werewolves, Soul-Eating Monsters, vampires, even guns and bombs—none were exempt from duplication.

The key point was that not only their shapes were copied, but also their skills!

Thus, the celestial beings began to slowly withdraw from the battlefield, allowing the enemies and their “Amethyst duplicates” to fight each other to the death.

Master Qingyang was taken aback: “This… Has my little disciple already grown this strong?”

Watching the purple silhouette sitting sideways on the back of the white divine beast in the sky, his eyes widened like brass bells!

Gan Lanlan surveyed the chaotic scene she had created, feeling quite pleased!

However, upon glancing at the zombies flailing around like headless flies, her brow furrowed.

These were actually people from our country, turned into this by those demons!

If they weren’t wiped out, they would eventually harm more people!

But if she exterminated them, that would only play into the hands of the Western Demon Clan.

Just as she was caught in this dilemma, she noticed that, surprisingly, several of the zombies in Wei Baocun were acting strangely! They were helping to protect the villagers of Sugarcane Village.

“Si Si, go to that brother Baocun.”

【Got it, Lanlan!】

“Brother Baocun.”

Holding a knife tightly in hand and defending the villagers, he exclaimed, “Celestial Master, why are you here?”

“Brother Baocun, what’s up with these zombies? They seem to be helping you.”

Wei Baocun scratched his head, puzzled. “I don’t know! I just thought about protecting the village chief and them, and then I found out that they started fighting on their own.”

Perhaps the birth of Baocun was not entirely useless.

“Brother Baocun, let me borrow your hand.”

Wei Baocun was already accustomed to following Gan Lanlan’s commands, preparing to stretch his hand out. Then he noticed his dirty hand and awkwardly wiped it on his clothes.

“Master, are you alright?”

“I’m fine, Yu’er, help me up!”

“Oh!”

“This scene is truly magnificent.”

“Indeed! Junior Sister is incredibly strong!”

Heaven and earth shook, winds roared, and thunder cracked as they watched “themselves” battling it out happily!

But in the end, they were bested by the “Amethyst selves” conjured by the spiritual energy of sugarcane!

Observing the vanishing purple hues on the battlefield, along with the few remaining immobile Western demons, it truly felt like an end!

The Western Demon Clan looked toward the figure who had wiped them all out in one stroke, Gan Lanlan, and scoffed, “If you have the ability, kill us! Otherwise, we will return!”

Gan Lanlan responded with a smile, “Fine! I’ll grant you that!”

Looking back at the celestial beings behind her, she declared, “Let’s go!” and turned to leave!

The crowd exchanged puzzled looks: since they had won, why leave?

But seeing the Celestial Lord following behind, they had no choice but to comply, trusting in his plan.

Sure enough, not long after, they heard distant screams of “Ahhhh! Help!” 

They turned to look back and saw hordes of zombies slowly engulfing them!

Then, heavenly fire rained down, and everything was obliterated.

After a series of tribulations, Sugarcane Village was still intact. Though they were all mortals, the elixirs of Lanshan Sect were not for nothing! While they couldn't live forever, they still had the ability to prolong life.

In Xunwei Courtyard, the living room!

Master Qingyang, Wen Gu, Wen Zhi, and Lin Yu were gathered around a table.

Wen Gu and Wen Zhi calmly brewed and sipped tea.

Master Qingyang and Lin Yu, however, looked as if they had experienced a significant shock, their eyes dazed as though their souls had left their bodies!

After finally regaining some composure, the two secretly glanced in Gan Lanlan's direction, immediately shielding their eyes.

They simply couldn't bear to look!

Gan Lanlan had just fought and was now exhausted, asleep! Of course, this was understandable, considering the crucial role she played in the battle.

However, the sight of the Celestial Lord holding his little disciple/sister on the couch was too much to bear!

No mistaking it; he was holding her! He was filled with thoughts of Gan Lanlan, without even sparing them a glance!

The smile on his face!

Occasionally smoothing her tousled hair that the breeze had disturbed!

The tender looks, almost as if he was going to kiss her temple! Ah! It was too much to handle!

Didn’t Si Si roll its eyes on the couch?

Si Si was a perceptive beast; it wouldn’t disturb its master’s sleep!

As for the male master? He had long gotten accustomed to this! 

But that wasn’t the case for Wen Gu and Wen Zhi! Master Qingyang and Lin Yu were far from accustomed!

Wen Gu shook his head and poured tea for the two. “Master, Junior Brother, tea!”

“Yes, yes, tea!”

“Definitely, tea!”

Unable to hold back any longer, Lin Yu quietly asked, “Um, what’s going on between the two disciples?”

“It’s exactly as you see!” 

“…”

“How did it progress so rapidly in just a few days?”

Wen Zhi chuckled, “It’s not just a few days; we’ve trained together for five hundred years, so we’re used to one another.”

“Zhi Zhi, elaborate!” 

“We entered the Celestial Lord’s ‘Time Mirror’ to train; while a day passes outside, a hundred years passes within. Moreover, the Celestial Lord and Lan’er have already married, so it’s only natural they’ve gotten used to it!”

Master Qingyang exclaimed, “What?!”

Lin Yu gasped, “What?!”

Perhaps their voices were too loud; Gan Lanlan furrowed her brow and seemed to wake up! 

The South Hua Celestial Lord also frowned, giving the two an icy glare!

The two froze in place! At that moment, they were nothing more than “quails” in Xunwei Courtyard!

“Si Nan, don’t scare them!”

The previously cold atmosphere blossomed into warmth.

Of course, the smile on the Celestial Lord’s face brightened!

“Lan’er, you’re awake? Do you need to sleep a little longer?”

Gan Lanlan sat up. “Not anymore.”

“Then would you like some tea? Or maybe something to eat?”

“No, thanks!”

“Then…”

He gently squeezed her waist. Casting her an eye, she said, “Alright.” 

The South Hua Celestial Lord replied, “Got it, I’ll keep quiet!”

Gan Lanlan caught Si Si leaping onto her lap, gently stroking its fur, pretending not to notice the tension between the Celestial Lord and Si Si.

Wen Zhi chuckled, whenever she saw the Celestial Lord getting thoroughly bested by her Junior Sister, she couldn’t help but want to laugh.

As the Celestial Lord’s aura was being overshadowed by the Junior Sister, Lin Yu, the mischievous kid, came to life, especially since he had been holding back for so long!

“Junior Sister! You finally woke up! I thought I was going to suffocate!”

Gan Lanlan attempted to get up, but someone feigned looking out the window while gripping her waist tightly like a vice!

Fine, let it be! What could she do with her own man? Just indulge him!

“Senior Brother, what’s wrong?” 

“Junior Sister, how did you command so many zombies?”

Gan Lanlan shook her head. “They’re not obeying me.”

“Huh? How did they attack the Western Demon Clan then?”

“Because of Brother Baocun!”

“Ah?” 

“Brother Baocun became a zombie, but he seems to have the ability to command the others; I simply borrowed a bit of his power.”

Lin Yu finally understood. “So that’s how it is.”

Seeing they were about to continue discussing, the South Hua Celestial Lord interrupted, “Alright, Lan’er still needs to rest; we’ll talk about this later!”

He lifted Si Si and tossed it onto his shoulder, cradling Gan Lanlan, and walked away without looking back.

Master Qingyang questioned in disbelief, “Did I just hear that right? The Celestial Lord said, ‘rest for the baby’?”

Lin Yu shouted, “Rest for the baby? Rest for the baby?!” his voice rising higher each time!

Wen Gu laughed, “Yes, Master, Junior Sister is pregnant now; you’ll be a grandmaster soon!”

In an instant, the entire Xunwei Courtyard lit up like Master Qingyang’s mood!

“I’m going to be a grandmaster? I’m going to be a grandmaster! Hahaha!”

Suddenly he reeled back. “But wait… your little Junior Sister hasn’t married the Celestial Lord yet; this…?”

Wen Zhi chuckled, “In the Time Mirror, the Celestial Lord has already held a grand wedding! Now, the Junior Sister finds it bothersome and doesn’t want to do it again.”

“Then I… I’ll go get some gifts!”

With that, he vanished!

“Eh? Master?” Lin Yu was left behind!

“Senior Brother, Senior Sister, can I go find Haozi? Lanshan Sect must be very busy right now; I want to help!”

As he spoke, he attempted to sneak away, sensing he was in danger soon!

Wen Gu said, “No need to rush. I see that your cultivation has shifted; it’s time for you to enter seclusion.”

“Eh???? No way!”

Entering seclusion would be so boring! He had been waiting to see his Junior Nephew!

Unfortunately, he had been unable to defeat his seniors before, and now, he could hardly reach even their fingertips!

Suppressing him!

Gan Lanlan stood by the window, holding two clay figurines.

The South Hua Celestial Lord embraced her from behind. “What, are the clay figurines cuter than me?” 

“I’m just thinking about some things.”

“What are you thinking about?”

“About everything I’ve experienced; it feels like a dream.”

“Ha, am I very handsome in that dream?” 

“Haha, you!”

“Lan’er, with me around, you’ll always be happy!” 

“Mm!”
