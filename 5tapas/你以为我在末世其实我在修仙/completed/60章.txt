At the beginning of humanity, its nature is inherently malevolent.

Ah, how ironic! Is this not a portrayal of "At the beginning of humanity, its nature is inherently malevolent"? 

Some members of the human race seem to possess evil in their very bones, as though it were innate! If looked at closely under a microscope, wouldn't they appear more beast than human? 

Nan Hua, who had been observing from the periphery for a long time, couldn't help but furrow his brow. He had only been in seclusion for a brief period, and the outside world had already turned chaotic! What on earth was the cultivation world doing?

He couldn't help but chuckle at the thought—if Gan Lanhua knew what he was pondering, she would surely retort: "You disappear into seclusion for three hundred years at a time; kids could be born and raised in that time! Perhaps they only dared to stir up trouble in your absence!"

Looking at the gloomy expressions of those present, Gan Lanhua quickly changed the topic: 

"What about Brother Bao Village? He doesn't seem very old."

"Oh, Bao Village? He’s a child I found! At that time, we had been living there for quite a long time, but no newborns had appeared despite many villagers aging and passing away. During that period, the entire monster village was completely lifeless. 

"I thought about going out to take a look. Aren't celestial teachers supposed to be all-powerful? If I could find one willing to help us, perhaps we could turn the situation around!

"Thus, I retraced my steps and begged my way back to Southern City. By then, Southern City had regained its past glory, but… it no longer belonged to us, and we could never return to it!

"I found the place where we were previously held. There, I encountered a malnourished woman who was about to give birth, looking nearly skeletal but with a prominent belly. She begged me to help her! Seeing her pitiful state, I went to find a midwife, but when the midwife saw who it was, she refused, saying, 'I won’t assist in the childbirth of a monster,' and left. I was left feeling stuck; fortunately, the woman managed to give birth on her own...

"She struggled desperately to bring the child into the world, but upon seeing the child, she seemed terrified… and, due to excessive bleeding, she passed away on the spot!"

Gan Lanhua quickly asked, "Terrified? But what was different about the child?"

"...This child is indeed unusual! His eyes protrude, and his skin is dark, looking far from human. When I held the child in my arms, I confirmed that he was still alive—though he looked rather strange!

"What does that matter when compared to us monsters? We all look like this and wouldn’t disdain him. So, I brought him back!"

"That would be Brother Bao Village, right?"

"Yes!"

Even Bao Village himself seemed a bit shocked. "Village Chief, I don’t look like that! I've seen people outside; I look just like everyone else!"

"That’s now. You used to look like that as a child!"

"No way! I was just a normal kid when I was little!"

The village chief felt helpless. "…Since I brought you here the whole time, you've never seen how normal kids look!"

Wei Bao Village pouted, "But Uncle and Auntie, and the Village Chief, everyone says I'm the best child in the village; that I’m a gift from heaven to you!"

Emmm, cough, cough—though it wasn’t the right time to laugh, they couldn’t help it!

Gan Lanhua and the others discreetly stifled their laughter for fear of drawing attention.

"Hey, silly child!"

Patting Wei Bao Village on the head, the village chief explained to Gan Lanhua and the others: 

"At that time, we all thought this child was a gift from heaven. Though he looked odd, I must say he was truly pure-hearted, which brought vivacity to our village! We didn’t care about his appearance, knowing that the world likely couldn't accommodate him—we believed it might be better for him to stay in the mountains with us for all his days. 

"However, later by chance, when he was playing in the mountains, he encountered a celestial teacher who was refining pills. The teacher originally thought he was a monster and intended to capture him for study! Yet this child’s pure goodness touched the teacher, who even invited him to the village for a meal!

"Fortunately, this teacher was a good man. Upon learning about our village's situation, he said he couldn't help everyone, but since Bao Village was still young, he could give it a try.

"He then gifted Bao Village a celestial pill. After consuming that pill, Bao Village transformed into his current self. Because of this, he grew up longing to venture out, hoping to find a teacher who could help the other villagers!"

Wen Gu nodded in approval, remarking: 

"That truly is his destiny!"

Wei Bao Village scratched his head, chuckling, "Heh heh heh, the village chief always says I have luck like a dog; wherever I go, I meet good fortune!"

"You silly child!"

Wei Bao Village looked up at Gan Lanhua, knowing all along that the celestial teacher willing to help him was none other than her.

“Celestial teacher, can you help us? Look, I got better because I took the pill, can't the village chief and the others also receive help?”

Gan Lanhua replied, “We aren't alchemists, this…!"

She initially intended to decline but couldn't bear to see the light of hope flicker in the eyes of the elderly after a lifetime of suffering.

"We will do our utmost to provide you with an answer."

Wei Bao Village excitedly exclaimed, "Thank you, thank you, celestial teacher! As long as you can save our village, I’ll do whatever you ask of me from now on!"

“No need to rush! You just returned; spend time with your family first. We won't be leaving for now.”

Watching Wei Bao Village flit around like a little monkey among the elderly, bringing smiles to their faces, she realized he was that village's hope!

"Big brother, have I caused trouble?"

"Only just realizing it now?"

"Uh…"

"Little sister, you know these people have no chance of being saved, don’t you?"

"Yes! But, big brother! You’re not against it?"

"What’s the use of objecting? Moreover, although it’s a troublesome matter, it’s not insurmountable. Just as you said, we’ll do our best!"

"Really? Thank you, big brother! Honestly, even if we can’t save them, I at least hope they can live a little better in the future! Additionally... I don’t think the invasion and slaughter of the outside tribes should be let slip by so easily!"

"You little sister, what do you want to do?"

"Big brother, what does history say about the massacre war against Southern City? Now, what are your thoughts?"

"Records about it are scant! However, in recent years, the influence of the Japanese tribe has grown significantly, and they are constantly provoking and attempting to incite war. As for the Southern City incident, I reckon they won’t admit to it—it might be hard to resolve. Many in the cultivation world wish to take them down, yet many have lost their bloodlust over the years…

"As for me? I don't mind being the chronicler of this history, nor do I mind becoming a general on the battlefield!"

She looked at him in delight: "Big brother, you..."

"I still have some status in the Hundred Knowledge Hall, combined with my master's and father's influence, it would be best for me to take charge of this matter."

Gently patting Gan Lanhua's head, he reassured her:

"The issues of the monster village are no longer solely yours to bear. So, little sister, don’t feel so pressured. If the sky falls, your big brother will be here for you!"

Lin Yu suddenly popped up from nowhere: "And me, big brother will stand with you too!"

Wen Zhi held her little sister’s hand, softly saying, "Sister, I’ll help as well."

While the siblings were touched, an out-of-place voice interrupted:

"What? Is it not better to look for this lord instead?"

The four turned around toward a certain celestial lord who had been trailing them but had barely made his presence known. 

Oh, he certainly hadn’t been entirely unnoticeable; during meals, he had been rather enthusiastic! Whenever there was food, Lin Yu had some grievances about how he devoured too much!

Oh, let’s not deviate so far! They were discussing serious matters now! 

With his arms crossed, leaning against a tree, completely detached—it was hard to tell that he wanted to involve himself in their affairs! 

However, Gan Lanhua cautiously asked: "Celestial lord, are you implying that you're willing to help?"

That would be perfect! Considering the involvement of two nations, the younger generation would have little say. If a notable figure from the celestial realm like Nan Hua stepped in, it would make all the difference!

"What’s wrong with this lord getting involved?"

As he spoke, he walked over and playfully tapped Gan Lanhua on the forehead.

“You silly girl! With this lord here, who do you need to look for?”

After saying that, he didn’t care about their expressions and walked off on his own.

Rubbing her forehead which was not truly hurt, Gan Lanhua muttered softly: 

"Hiss~ If you're going to get involved, then just do it! Why call me foolish? You’re the silly one… Just wait until I get my clay figurine back from you! Hmph!"

Wen Gu and Wen Zhi exchanged glances, feeling that they dared not meddle in the affairs between the celestial lord and their little sister!

Even though they noticed, along this journey, the celestial lord was treating their little sister a bit differently!

Lin Yu seemed to think that perhaps the celestial lord simply found his little sister cute and clever, with excellent cooking skills, thus wanting to snatch her away! Looking at his little sister with pity, he fumed with indignation, "Little sister, are you alright? Wait… I'll help you get your clay figurine back!"

Stunned and touched, Gan Lanhua looked at her big brother. She never expected him to be so brave! But then she asked: 

"Big brother, isn’t the celestial lord your idol? Besides, you can’t take him on!"

"…I’ll help you get it back when I can fight the celestial lord!" He confidently nodded.

"…By that time, my clay figurine might have turned to dust!"

"…First Blood."

"And currently, big brother, you can’t even take me on!"

"…Double kill."

Even Wen Zhi chimed in with a jab: "If Hao Zi knew you wanted to take on his revered Nan Hua, you might not even be friends afterward!

"…Triple kill."

Seeing his stupefied younger brother, Wen Gu couldn’t help but chuckle, feeling a little merciful and choosing to remain silent as he could foresee the disaster if the boy seriously considered confronting the celestial lord over a clay figurine—things could go south very quickly… and he wanted to see how that would unfold!

"Ahem~ Little sister, since the celestial lord wants to get involved, that’s even better. Let’s first discuss how to address the situation in Monster Village!"
