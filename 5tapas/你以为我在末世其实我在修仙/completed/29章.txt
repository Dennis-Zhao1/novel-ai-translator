**Arrangement**

As the true ice and snow apocalypse arrived, even Dr. Zhang and his colleagues stated that, even with the strongest systems, they could only avoid its edge! What chance did the small Sugarcane Base have? 

From the tumultuous early days of disaster—earthquakes shaking the ground and incessant rain—to the later appearance of zombies, many had long anticipated these events! For instance, the frontline warriors like Dr. Zhang had already been alerted by the system! Unlike her, who was like a stray kid, isolated from the news…

She and her friend Clara had managed to survive until now, which perhaps was beyond the main system’s expectations! Don't ask her how she knew—after all, she was clinging to Dr. Zhang’s coattails. 

Though she was insignificant, Dr. Zhang's status in the world was among the highest! 

In response to this crisis, Lanlan had spared no effort; she promptly purchased the safest protective shield available in the Star Network. With no time to build one herself, she directly expended energy points for the system to create it. She could only hope that this disaster… would still leave a glimmer of hope for humanity.

[*Clara, for the first time, I'm genuinely grateful to the system, cough cough... It makes me feel that at least, there is still hope for humanity.*] 

[*Lanlan… but you’ve borrowed a significant amount of debt from the Star Network this time. Was it worth it?*] 

Thanks to her previous exploration of the Star Network’s financial system, and due to her high credit rating, she borrowed external debts. It can be said that this time, she not only lost all her assets but also ended up deeply in debt. 

[*It’s worth it… cough cough… it is! *] 

[*No matter what, Lanlan, Clara is always on your side.*] 

[*Cough cough, thanks Clara! Cough cough…*] 

[*Lanlan, you should rest now; you’ve been too hard on yourself lately. You still haven’t recovered from your last injury! *]

[*Don’t worry, cough cough, I’m fine! Cough cough cough, I’ll be alright after a little rest!*]

[*Hmm, Lanlan, be sure to rest well. I’ll keep watch outside for you.*] 

Clara even thoughtfully dimmed the lights and adjusted the room temperature to be suitable for sleep. 

Yet in the darkness, intermittent coughing could be heard… 

[*Lanlan, I won’t let anything happen to you!*]

*

The world outside was blindingly white, then gradually plunged into darkness. People began observing daily, still filled with hope. However, as darkness fell, despair ultimately enveloped them. 

Yet life had to go on! 

Confirming that the entire Earth had descended into an ice age, the remaining species were now the most precious resources. Fortunately, the Sugarcane Base had no shortage of supplies! 

Once various bases could connect, Dr. Zhang and his team began researching ways to exchange materials. To facilitate this, they specifically established an Ice Transport Team to deliver supplies between the bases. They also searched for survivors! 

As an important grain-producing base, the Sugarcane Base drew attention from various parties, attracting some reckless individuals hoping to raid it. The results were predictable… after all, the protective system produced by the system was not something just anyone could breach! 

Whether in feudal dynasties or democratic eras; amidst war or in periods of peace, basic survival was always humanity’s main concern. Having the Sugarcane Base largely become self-sufficient was quite impressive!

Some bases, despite possessing cutting-edge technology and military power, could not guarantee their citizens' basic survival. The once-boasted ideals of democracy and freedom seemed nothing but a fleeting dream. 

After a year of stability, the United States began uniting with resource-scarce small nations to start plundering. 

No, perhaps this wasn’t even the beginning; it could have been schemed for a long time!

“Lanlan, according to your request, all the food in the warehouse has been transported, and the seeds have been sent over as well. I've also contacted Dr. Zhang, and he will send someone to assist Team Hua.” 

“Alright, cough cough cough, thank you for your hard work, cough cough~” 

While coughing, she noted down something on a piece of paper. 

“Lanlan, are you… okay??” 

“Cough cough, don’t worry, I’m fine, just a chronic issue. Cough cough… as Dr. Hua said, it’s just some residual effects; I’ll get better with time.” 

“You…” 

“What?” She continued writing, barely even glancing up! 

Guanxin wanted to say more, but upon seeing her increasingly frail figure and the trembling body afflicted by coughing, he ultimately chose to step out, gently closing the study door behind him. 

Standing at the door, he couldn’t help but clench his fists, reluctant to leave!

By the third year of the ice apocalypse, the world had undergone immense changes! 

However, this didn’t affect life at the Sugarcane Base. Having grown accustomed to underground living, people still worked, studied, and lived according to their former divisions of labor. 

The younger folks like Guanxin started researching the information network, and the more they understood the global landscape, the more they realized: 

Life at the Sugarcane Base was already quite happy! 

The base's inhabitants only needed to focus on developing agriculture and animal husbandry to provide materials for other places, earning corresponding energy points to guarantee their basic living needs. 

Additionally, the base leader had instituted a reward mechanism: 

[*Whether an ability user or an ordinary person, whoever can successfully cultivate food or breed new creatures in the ice apocalypse without relying on the base's energy source will be awarded 100,000 energy points! Let's all work together to initiate the post-apocalyptic farming mode and truly achieve self-sufficiency!*] 

This reward was quite appealing at the Sugarcane Base, especially for ordinary individuals. 

Everyone suddenly had a goal to strive for and began to immerse themselves in farming! 

As for the confusion and fear regarding the apocalypse, they declared, “Who cares when there’s planting to be done?!”

*

Team Hua and Guanxin, being the base elders, occasionally needed to use the Ice Transport Team to communicate and exchange supplies with other bases. 

Lanlan had long since stopped managing base affairs, as her health had deteriorated increasingly since the ice apocalypse began. 

The food being sent out this time was enough for the existing humans to last ten years, and she trusted Dr. Zhang would handle everything properly! 

As for the Sugarcane Base, she felt at ease with Team Hua and Guanxin around! 

Once Guanxin had closed the door, Lanlan set down her pen and rubbed her aching wrist. 

[*Clara, cough cough, is my health… cough cough, getting worse?*] 

[*Lanlan… please rest well! You’ll be fine!*] 

[*Clara, no more… cough cough… comforting me. I know my body well enough. Can you tell me… how much time do I have left? Cough cough!*] 

[*Lanlan!*] 

[*... At least let me be prepared! *] 

[*Lanlan, boohoo. Your body functions indicate, you might not have more than a year left...*]
