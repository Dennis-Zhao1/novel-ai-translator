### The Power of the Granary

Once everyone had confirmed the cooperative relationship, it was time to sit down and enjoy a cup of tea.

"In this chaotic world, which many people call the end times, have we really reached a point where it's about ‘eating people’? Are there really that many such individuals?" As the topic turned serious, Team Leader Hua fell into a moment of silence.

"The truth is, as we journeyed here, we encountered quite a few bases. While life has been tough, we haven't reached the point of cannibalism. We've tracked this cannibal group for a long time now; wherever they go, nothing survives. I’ve always had a question—given their strength, they shouldn’t be weak. There might even be a mysterious force behind them. How did you manage to capture them?"

At this point, Lanlan Gan felt she should contribute.

"Their leader is an earth-element ability user. He likely uses his powers to hide a horde of zombies underground. I observed that the zombies surrounding the city are all caked in dirt. If I’m right, he was controlling these zombies to attack other bases from underground. Utilizing the zombie army to flatten other bases isn't tough; they need not lift a finger themselves—he probably just picked up the spoils afterward."

Hearing this, she couldn't help but chuckle.

"As for how we caught them? Even if he’s tough-headed, he can't penetrate our underground defenses. The bumps on his head are still there, by the way!"

"…"

"Currently, they’re being held separately, and we haven’t provided them with food or water. To be honest, I’m not sure how to handle them."

"We’ve lost many brothers to them… can we take care of it?" 

"That would be best."

According to Team Leader Hua, those individuals were primarily involved in the underworld or had served time. One small hoodlum had even boasted:

"I was thrilled when I heard the world was ending! I’ve read so many apocalypse novels. Don’t they always say food becomes scarce in the end times? But you can eat people! And only those who eat people are the strongest; those being eaten are merely weak. Following our leader, of course, I’ll be strong!"

This shows just how misguided these people were. Thankfully, she didn’t need to worry about it anymore. She merely had to tie them up and hand them over to Team Leader Hua, without prying into their fate. From then on, these individuals would cease to exist.

If you ask why Lanlan Gan didn’t construct city walls, it ties back to the recent "upgrade news" released by the system.

Previously, Lanlan had already set her sights on the materials for building walls and moats on the Star Network. Moreover, with her energy points surpassing one million, she had ample funds and was quite wealthy. 

Apart from daily earnings from renting properties and other business ventures, she had also invested in financial products on the Star Network, reaping substantial benefits. 

Yes, the Star Network did indeed have a "banking system"!

However, recently the system announced an upgrade that instilled a sense of crisis in Lanlan.

【System Upgrade Notification: Congratulations, you have upgraded to Warrior No. 997! Keep up the good work!】

From the first upgrade, Lanlan realized that having the Star Network system did not guarantee absolute safety. Each upgrade typically came with a cost. She never put everything at the mercy of the system—she still needed to grow independently.

Apocalyptic abilities were indeed varied, and there were several unique ability users in their base: 

For instance, a water-element user could produce boiling water, while most could only produce cold water. 
Another earth-element user could burrow underground, masking their scent from zombies, and had achieved great success while rescuing nearby towns. Ordinary earth-element users could only pile up soil to build walls…

Regarding Lanlan's abilities, thanks to the increasing number of special ability users, nobody was surprised by her skills anymore. 

Many believed she possessed a rare wood-element and metal-element ability, which explained why the houses she created could mask zombie scents.

It was precisely this skill that had led Wang Pang to underestimate Lanlan, leading him to act domineeringly at the base… until it ended badly for him!

【So, Sisi, this time… was there another warrior's fall?】

【Yes, Lanlan. However, the main system has closed the messages this time, so I don’t know the specifics! Originally, we could have shared the resources, but the main system has directly increased all warriors' safety factor by 2%! By the way, you received an additional 1% safety factor, so the Granary Base can boost its safety by 3%!】

【Huh? What's with the extra perks?】

【Because you're too weak!】

【……】

【The main system's original words were: Warrior No. 1000 was doing quite well; unexpectedly, they survived this long, so they gave her an extra 1% safety factor!】

Lanlan expressed her surprise at the nature of the main system.

However, this welfare was genuinely good—more was better, at least it meant she could live a little longer.

But upon reflection, even if the main system blocked the fallers’ information, she could probably guess some reasons behind it!

In a chaotic world, one careless move could lead to total loss:
It could be due to her not being powerful enough or because her opponents were too strong;
It could also stem from arrogance leading to downfall, or perhaps just plain bad luck.

Ultimately, caution is key to survival.

From the start, Lanlan had chosen a defensive strategy, and while she might miss some opportunities, it would ensure the stable development of the base for quite some time.

All she needed to do next was wait for an opportunity and act accordingly.

And now, that opportunity had come knocking.

The base was now on the right track. As long as no major dangers emerged and internal members didn't sabotage themselves, it could develop peacefully. 

So, when the military of Hua Kingdom extended an olive branch, all she had to do was fully cooperate as the base owner, strategically showcase some advantages, intimidate any ill-intentioned entities, and enjoy the benefits of a larger support system.

When the upper echelons of Hua Kingdom learned about this "hidden paradise," they showed great interest and importance toward the Granary Base. They even conducted a direct line of communication, indicating plans to send personnel soon to assist in inspecting the base and strengthening its construction.

Team Leader Hua also requested a work application from his superiors to operate nearby the Granary Base.

However, considering that the Granary Base had mostly covered the surrounding disaster-stricken areas, there were currently no urgent tasks at hand.

Given the special circumstances of the Granary Base, the upper echelons arranged for Team Hua to serve as a vanguard team to assist in construction and ensuring safety.

The Granary community bustled with activity as the new grain-growing movement began.
 
Unfortunately, the professionals hadn’t arrived yet, and Team Hua was lacking materials for basic defenses. More importantly, having witnessed the base's natural defensive capabilities against zombies—more accurately, the unique building materials—they decided to focus on their specialized tasks: you handle the infrastructure, I'll handle the farming—neither party would hinder the other!

After Team Hua experienced the Granary Ranch and Granary Farm firsthand, they profoundly understood the confidence of this base. 

As time passed, not only had some individuals developed unique abilities in the early apocalypse period, but animals and plants also exhibited various degrees of mutation.

With food being of paramount importance to humanity, the safety of consuming mutated crops was the main topic of global research currently. 

However, here, Team Hua observed vast, organized, sectioned-off farms; these plants and animals reportedly had very short growth cycles and seemed to have broken seasonal constraints. They had diverse species, grew rapidly, and yielded high outputs—most importantly, they were purely organic and safe to consume!

As for the reason behind it, aside from the evident zoning and use of 3-meter-high walls topped with transparent glass, there was nothing particularly unique. 

However, Wang Pang mentioned that due to the application of space and time abilities here, as long as there were daily maintainers with time and space abilities, the yield could be accelerated.

Of course, what fascinated everyone most was that the entire Granary community was literally overflowing with sugarcane, exposed to the blazing sun. 

It was said that this sugarcane was nurtured by the base owner, Lanlan Gan, and was extraordinarily resilient against the strange weather of the apocalypse. Anyone interested could apply to transplant it in their home, serving as both decoration and protective measures—it could even be eaten!

Everyone speculated that since Lanlan loved sugarcane so much, the sugarcane produced by her abilities was unique. Thus, no one minded that the base was named after it.

In summary, the Granary Base had a significant grain output, especially since most tasks were handled by ordinary folks; if capable users took over, efficiency would blast through the roof!

Simultaneously, there were still vast undeveloped areas, so the future food production from this base would undoubtedly be astonishing. 

Once the upper echelons sent teams for inspection, the Granary Base would likely become a coveted target for all sides.

After all, no matter how strong technology and military forces are, if basic needs aren't met, what development can be discussed!
