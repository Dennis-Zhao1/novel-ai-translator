**Old Friends**

Of course, she was packing up and getting ready to leave! After all, she was going to investigate the monster village, and as for the competition, she had already won, so there was nothing more for her to do.

"Little Junior Sister, are we leaving right now?" 

"It's not 'we'; it's 'I'! This is my business, and you don’t need to follow me, Big Junior Brother." She hurriedly gathered her things without even looking back, showing how eager she was!

"Besides, didn't you say that those who cultivate immortality shouldn't care about formalities? Traditionally, the rewards in competitions are distributed by the Sect Leader afterward, aren't they? Since there's no award ceremony, that means I have nothing to do with it. I should first check on the monster village situation!"

"This..."

Lin Yu felt that Little Junior Sister had a point, but... he was still so excited! They were first, after all! How could they not celebrate a little?

"I'm afraid, Lan’er, you can’t leave just yet."

She paused her search and used her magic to pack the last of her belongings. Gan Lanlan turned around, puzzled. "Master, why not?"

“The head of the Immortal Alliance wants to see us.” 

“See us? What’s the matter?”

Gan Lanlan furrowed her brows! 

"I don’t know; I just received a message from the Sect Leader. Let's go see what's the matter first. As for the monster village, once we've met with the leader of the alliance, I’ll have your Senior Brothers and Sisters accompany you."

"Master, I can go alone; there's no need to trouble my Senior Brothers and Sisters!"

“Be obedient! The world of cultivation is not as safe as you think. I can't rest easy letting you go out alone. Now come on; we need to go meet the alliance leader.” 

“...Fine!” 

The five of them arrived at the conference hall, where the atmosphere was unexpectedly grand!

Little Senior Brother quietly gave her a brief overview, explaining that all the attendees were the heads of various sects.

“Junior Brother Qingyang is here." 

Sitting at the upper left was an elderly man with a celestial aura—Xuanqing, the leader of the Lanshan Sect.

“Master Brother! Alliance Leader, fellow Masters!” 

He led his disciples in greeting the Masters and Elders present, and then took a seat. After all, he had a reputation to uphold, especially since his disciples had just won the championship. If he didn't sit, who would?

“May I ask why Master Brother has summoned us?” 

The Alliance Leader, a rather plump and jovial man, replied, “Qingyang, we’ve found South华仙君.”

“Really?” 

Looking at the excited crowd around him, Gan Lanlan felt a whirlwind of questions but didn’t want to ask anything right now! Her mind was already flying off to the monster village!

A head from another unnamed sect sighed, “I can't believe it’s been 300 years, and we've finally found South华仙君.” 

Fortunately, her Master was still clear-headed, though surprised and excited; he also sensed that there was a specific reason they had been called, as usually, no one from those sects sought them out.

Cough, cough—one might want to recall that their master had often been away.

The only one who was interesting was the one who enjoyed wandering from peak to peak!

The other two had turned completely indulgent; who would willingly seek trouble?

“Master Brother, since we’ve found South华仙君, let’s invite him out to oversee the important matters!” 

“Isn’t that why I called you here?”

“Called us? What is your instruction?” 

“Indeed! Qingyang, though we have found South华仙君, the situation isn't good. We’ve tried various means and discovered that he currently only responds to natural energy. In our vast cultivation world, only you and your disciples possess natural energy, which is why we wish for you to try.”

“May I ask where South华仙君 is now?” 

“In the secret realm of Lanshan Sect!” 

“If the Immortal Lord is in trouble, we shall go at once! However, my younger disciples have low powers, and that secret realm is fraught with dangers; I'm afraid...” 

“Master Qingyang, your statement is somewhat questionable. Your student displayed outstanding ability in this year's competition!” 

Not being sure which sect this criticism came from, there was a hint of acidity in their tone.

“Indeed! Master Qingyang's teachings must be exemplary! My inexperienced disciple has mentioned wanting to practice sparring with your little Junior Sister.” 

He was probably a Master from Wanjian Mountain, carrying a gigantic sword! He seemed to be a rather straightforward elder!

While everyone debated this year's competition, Xuanqing was left speechless! 

They were discussing something important; how could they be talking about a mere competition? Their Lanshan Sect revered peace and didn't care about fighting for first place.

Of course, this year’s championship had truly depended on their little disciple from Wanzhi Mountain; she really did have some skills. Lost in thought, he nodded his head to acknowledge.

However, he continued, “My fellow disciples need not worry. Although the secret realm may be somewhat dangerous, we several elders have already discussed providing protection throughout the journey to ensure your safety. We wouldn’t send you if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. Just give it a try! If things don’t work out, don’t force it!”

Not waiting for Master Qingyang to refuse, he waved his sleeve, “Go prepare; we enter the secret realm tomorrow at noon.” 

What could they do? They had to obey their Master Brother’s orders. “Fine!”

Finally, the background characters, the disciples, had a chance to chatter! According to their Senior Brothers and Sisters, that South华仙君 was one of the founding ancestors of Lanshan Sect and was the most powerful being in the world!

As for who might be stronger, rumors circulated that he had gone into seclusion!

Others said he had ascended to higher realms. On this matter, Wen Gu commented, “Nonsense!”

As for being the strongest, it was because of the demon war 500 years ago, where South华仙君 fought valiantly against the horde of demons, repelling the demon lord and becoming the revered battle god and immortal of the cultivation world—a kind of national idol!

Even though South华仙君 had long withdrawn from the immortal realm, everyone still refused to give up on looking for him. 

Not even the usually calm Master, Senior Brother, or Senior Sisters could hide their excitement now!

Why were they looking for him? 

It was said that 300 years ago, there was turmoil in the immortal realm. In order to uphold justice, South华仙君 was ambushed and heavily injured, disappearing afterward. It was this battle that solidified Lanshan Sect’s status as the top sect!

Rumor had it in the immortal realm that he might have ascended to a higher plane, while others claimed he was living in seclusion, and even more claimed that he had already perished…

Even Master Qingyang didn’t expect to hear news of him! 

Although it didn't appear to be good news, it concerned their idol, and thus they couldn't ignore it!

Master Qingyang didn't impose restrictions on the disciples, allowing them to return and prepare their things, meeting again at the designated time!

“Little Junior Sister, be careful!” 

As soon as they reached the door, they suddenly watched a flash of white light dash towards Gan Lanlan, moving so quickly that they couldn't stop it in time.

Fortunately, she had a strong self-defense ability, though it only managed to deflect the impact slightly.

But that was just enough; the others could see clearly that it wasn't just a white light, but a small white beast that crashed into the wall by Gan Lanlan.

In the blink of an eye, they saw the small beast's appearance, which had already bitten through her defense and rushed into... Gan Lanlan's arms.

“Are you okay, Little Junior Sister?”

“Little Junior Sister??”

“Little Junior Sister, are you alright?” 

Holding the gentle little beast in her arms, Gan Lanlan paused for a moment, then smiled happily, "I’m fine; it’s just a little beast. Its fur feels really nice!" 

It seemed indeed not aggressive, and they all finally relaxed. 

They surrounded it, taking a few glances, but none could recognize what kind of beast it was!

“I’m not sure what kind of beast this is; Little Junior Sister, still be careful...” 

Before she could finish speaking, they heard Gan Lanlan let out a sharp breath. 

It turned out the little beast had nibbled on her finger when no one was watching. 

“Why is this little beast biting people? Little Junior Sister, quickly throw it away!” 

She had initially thought of keeping the little beast after finding it, thinking raising it might not be a bad idea.

But now that it had bitten her, she prepared to throw it away... but suddenly froze!

Because she heard a familiar voice in her mind: 

“Lanlan, whimper, I finally found you!”
