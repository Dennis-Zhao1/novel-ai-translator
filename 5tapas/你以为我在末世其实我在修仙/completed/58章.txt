Chapter: Arrival at Monster Village

With Village Chief David leading the way, the journey ahead became much smoother.

“Village Chief, when did they build a bridge here? I remember crossing the river in a wooden tub when I left!” 

Although it was merely a simple log bridge, just wide enough for one person to pass, Wei Baojun was pleasantly surprised as he gazed at the small mountain village at the bridge’s end. He didn’t feel any homesickness at all. On the contrary, he felt like he was returning in glory because he was bringing the Immortal Master and hope to the village!

“Ha ha! After you left, the villagers had little to do, so they gradually built a bridge. They thought if you ever came back, you would have a way home.” 

Wei was choked up. “Village Chief…” 

“Foolish child! Don’t cry! What if our guests see and laugh? Wipe your tears!” 

“Yes!”

As they got closer to the village, Chief David grew more apprehensive. 

As the initiator of this exploratory journey, Clara Joy took the lead. Once they reached the riverbank, she stepped forward to support the old chief.

“Chief David, as I mentioned on the way here, you don’t need to worry. We’re not bad people.” 

“Immortal Master, I don’t deserve such praise! I’m honored just to have someone like you to support me,” he replied, feeling flattered by the attention. “I’m not worried that you’re bad people; to be honest, our village… has nothing worth bad people’s interest anymore.” 

“I can see you have something to say?” 

“It’s just that I’m afraid of scaring our esteemed guests. You can see how I am… I worry that our village’s monster residents will frighten you.” 

“Chief, now that we’re here, we won’t mind these things.”

Seeing that the chief still hesitated, she smiled and asked the question she had been wanting to ask. 

“Chief David, I believe Wei Baojun mentioned you were normal people before? What happened that caused such a change?” 

“Yes, we were ordinary people. We are not monsters.” 

“Then that’s it! We are here to investigate this matter. No matter how you look, we are not afraid. You can rest assured!” 

“Very well!”

Monster Village was indeed quite small! 

So small that as soon as they entered the village gate, everything was within sight. 

Perhaps the village rarely saw outsiders, as the villagers began to gather slowly. 

From their vantage point, counting Wei Baojun, there were barely 22 people in total!

As they looked over the village, even the liveliest Lin Yu fell silent. 

“Big Brother, Big Sister, Junior Sister, they are…” 

The village was extremely run-down, radiating an aura of despondency! 

The dilapidated thatched and earthen houses were their only shelter from wind and rain! 

The wood stacked at the entrance and the sun-dried wild vegetables seemed to represent the villagers' entire possessions! 

They stood or sat, their expressions numb and filled with a hint of trepidation as they watched these outsiders. 

If it were just that, it wouldn’t be so bad, but unfortunately, it was more than that… because their appearances were all different!

Regardless of gender, the vast majority were missing arms and legs, lacking eyes, noses, and ears, and some even… had no limbs! 

If it were just a few “missing parts,” they wouldn’t be labeled as “monsters”—that would just be considered disabilities! 

But they all had some extra features: 

For example, a hand growing from their back, or a hand where their leg should be, or even three eyes, two mouths… 

Some had skin resembling patched fabric, while others bore the skin of different species altogether! 

By comparison, the chief's tiger-like arms were considered better off; at least, when disguised, he could still resemble a normal person. 

“This is probably why this place is called ‘Monster Village!’” 

“This is Wei Baojun bringing an Immortal Master from outside! They are here to help our village! Why are you all standing around? Hurry and entertain our honored guests!” 

The once lifeless villagers suddenly sprang to life, as though some button had been pressed. 

“Ah, we have guests coming to the village!” 

“Hey, hurry! Bring out the good food!” 

“Go catch a chicken in the back! We’re having chicken tonight!” 

“But we only have three chickens in total.” 

“We need to treat the Immortal Masters! They are Immortal Masters!” 

“Right, right!” 

Seeing the elderly citizens move about with old bodies, their spirits revived by the arrival of “hope.” 

“Aunt Lin, let me help! I’m strong; you all rest!” 

“Hey! Wei Baojun is back! How wonderful! You kill the chicken; Auntie will boil the water!” 

Lin Yu wanted to decline, but just as he opened his mouth, the chief interrupted him! 

“Immortal Masters, we can’t thank you enough for not minding us! Although we have little to offer you, everyone is eager to show this enthusiasm, so please don’t refuse!” 

Lin Yu wanted to decline further, but when he saw his senior brothers and sisters not reacting, he became even more hesitant! 

Quietly retreating to stand by his senior brothers and sisters, he murmured: 

“Big Brother, Big Sister, Junior Sister! There may not be any dangers of secret realms here, but for some reason… it makes me feel very uncomfortable. They look so pitiful!” 

“Little Brother, even if they are suffering, they haven’t given up hope, have they? Perhaps this place is the real human experience!” 

“Right, Junior Sister is correct! Yu’er, I think this time we will undergo a unique ‘training.’” 

“Brother, does life in the ordinary world really have to be this hard?” 

Wen Zhi was truly shocked! Having traveled all this way, despite witnessing the suffering of human life, she did not realize human life could be so tough! 

If this were her… she feared she wouldn’t have been able to survive! 

“Life is never easy, Junior Sister! Besides, what we see now may only be the tip of the iceberg. The hardest times for them may have passed long ago, and aren’t we here to investigate this matter?” 

Looking at the transformation of the villagers from “lifeless” to “vibrant,” he suddenly understood the chief’s feelings: 

“Right now, all they want is to simply ‘live!’” 

“Is there anything we can do to help them?” 

“Yes! There must be something!” 

Even if it didn’t exist, she would create the conditions to make it happen! 

“There’s not much to offer in the village, so please don’t mind it!” 

It was clear that the chief was genuinely doing his best to entertain them! 

Although they sought experience and training, seeing the dirty nails and chipped bowls… Wei Baojun couldn’t help but shed tears, feeling deeply touched! 

An old lady kept gazing at them, hesitant to speak. 

Clara Joy, wanting to escape the fate of eating, quickly asked: 

“Grandma, is there something you want to ask?” 

Fortunately, she was young; otherwise, her senior brothers and sisters wouldn’t know how to address these elders, considering they were older than the villagers! 

“I, I just want to ask, are you really Immortal Masters?” 

Ah! Just when she was nodding off, someone was sending her a pillow! 

“Dear Elders, please sit down! We truly are cultivators; we came due to Wei Baojun’s introduction and learned about your village’s situation. We’re here to investigate and see if we can help! This also counts as a training experience for us!” 

With that, she waved her hand, taking out tables and chairs for dining from her spatial bag! 

Looking at the suddenly appearing feast, the elderly were stunned. 

“Wow! They really are divine beings!” 

“The Immortal Masters have come to save us!” 

Even Chief David was overjoyed to the point of tears! 

“Village Chief, please let everyone share this food!” 

“This… how can we dare…” 

“It’s alright; these are all good and easily digestible foods. Let’s eat together!” 

Given their physical condition, eating and drinking had been problems. So for now, helping a little was better than nothing! 

“These are not ordinary items; they are spiritual rice and spirit plants. Eating them will be beneficial to your health! After the meal, I still have things to ask everyone!” 

Wei Baojun quickly advised, “Village Chief, hurry and eat! These are immortal things, and eating them will benefit everyone! Who knows, maybe you’ll be healed like me after eating them!” 

“Alright!” 

Clara Joy started distributing porridge and vegetables, watching the villagers eat with tearful gratitude. 

One elderly woman was crying uncontrollably. 

“Grandma, what’s wrong? Do you feel unwell?” 

Holding a clean porcelain bowl, she shook her head while choked with sobs: 

“No, I just didn’t expect to eat such good food! We’ve lived here for forty years, neither fully human nor ghostly… wahhh…” 

“Yes, neither human nor ghost, wahhh…” 

The cries were contagious, filled with so much suffering, so much resentment, and so many hopes for a sweeter life after bitter hardship.
