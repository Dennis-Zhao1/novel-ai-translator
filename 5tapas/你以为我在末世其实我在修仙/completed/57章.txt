**The Village Chief with the Tiger Arm**

After a long journey, they were almost there.

“Up ahead is the entrance to our village, but the cart might not make it the whole way.”

Recently, Wei Baocun felt that being around the immortals encouraged him to change his way of speaking! Just like the chief said, one must learn from the excellence of others in order to improve oneself!

“It’s okay! Mr., Senior Brother, Senior Sister, Little Junior Sister, we can get off the cart now!” 

Finally, he wouldn't have to share the same space with this great being any longer! 

Although idols are wonderful, even when silent, their aura can be overwhelming!

Stepping out of the cart, he gazed at the desolate mountain in front of him, agreeing that this place was indeed remote, with wild grass growing all around.

A faint narrow path snaked through the wild growth!

Perhaps this was the trail used by those who came to gather firewood?

Gan Lanlan looked curiously at this barren land that resembled a wasteland and asked Wei Baocun, “Brother Baocun, how long did it take you to come from your village?”

Wei Baocun scratched his head, recalling, “I... I can’t remember. I just wandered on my own based on direction. It wasn’t too long—about thirty sunrises and sunsets, roughly!”

“……” Wow, it took an entire month just to get out of the mountains.

“So, can you find your way back to where you came from?”

“Don’t worry! It’s on me! You gentlemen can relax, I know the way. I definitely won’t get lost going back home.”

Let’s trust you for now!

As the senior disciple, Wen Gu felt obliged to remind everyone, “Even though this is at the foot of the mountain, you should still be cautious.”

“Got it, Brother.”

“No worries, Senior Brother.”

“Understood, Senior Brother.”

……

“At this place, our cultivation is suppressed, but that doesn’t mean we can’t use our abilities.”

“Senior Brother, what do you mean?”

“Baocun, you remember the path you took when you left, right? Just point the way, and we can use our Instantaneous Shift technique to get there; it’s better than wandering on foot.”

“Sure!”

Under the gaze of four pairs of eyes, Wei Baocun nervously swallowed.

Following his direction, they crossed a mountain, passed a river, climbed another mountain, and traversed a cave...

As expected, they ended up lost!

Wei Baocun was also confused; this was how he had gotten out!

It had been straightforward when he left; why couldn’t he find his way back now?

Even the usually quiet Nan Hua Xianjun couldn’t keep quiet anymore; he twirled the wild grass in his hand:

“Kid, how did you get out of your village? Was the first path you took a mountain road or a waterway?”

Realizing this was someone respected by several immortals, Wei Baocun respectfully replied, “Mr., I first took a boat across the river. Then I wandered into a forest for a long while, crossed a mountain, and followed a beam of light until I found a small opening, and just kept going. Later I traversed mountains and rivers until I finally got out.”

Saying that, he scratched his head shyly, seeming to not understand how he could not find his way back home!

Sorry, but with all this back and forth, who could know where it was!

Well, someone could know—oh, not someone; it’s a great being!

“Head southeast; there’s a small mountain opening nearby, that’s likely the place he spoke of.”

What’s more, there really was a peculiar village in that direction.

After that, he fell silent, and the group of fellow disciples exchanged glances and quickly bowed in thanks:

“Thank you, Mr.!”

It was still up to the senior brother to cast the spell, leading the group along the direction Nan Hua Xianjun indicated. Sure enough, they spotted a small mountain.

This peaceful and serene place reminded Gan Lanlan of the tale of the Peach Blossom Spring: 

“Beyond the forest, there’s a mountain with a small opening that seems to glow from within.”

“Yes, yes, yes, that’s it! Mr., look, there are marks I painted on that rock!”

Saying this, she happily dashed toward the exit.

Seeing Wei Baocun so excited indicated that this time they had indeed taken the right path. Sure enough, the great being was amazing!

As expected, outside was… yet another forest.

“So which way do we go now?”

Wei Baocun was also troubled; if he were alone, he could gradually explore and eventually find his way home!

But with the immortals around, he felt embarrassed to point the wrong way.

But he didn’t consider that jumping around from one place to another was hardly better than finding his way on foot. After all, there was no way to pinpoint directions.

“Why don’t you all rest here; I’ll go find the way. Once I do, I’ll come back and lead you?”

Wen Gu stopped him: “No need!”

Thinking the immortals were dissatisfied with his idea, Wei Baocun lowered his head in disappointment.

Wen Gu unfurled his folding fan and shouted loudly towards the forest ahead:

“Come out!”

“Huh? Besides us from the village, are there other people here? How come I don’t know about them?”

“Since there’s no one else here but your villagers, could it be that they are your own people?”

“The lady speaks the truth!” Once Wei Baocun heard that, he felt delighted and shouted across, “Hey, whoever is over there, come out! Are you from our village? I’m Wei Baocun; I’m back! I brought the immortals with me!”

A figure staggered into view, responding loudly, “Baocun? Is that you, Baocun?”

“Chief? Is that you, Chief Dayong?”

As the figure grew closer, everyone finally got a clear look at the hunched old man.

As he approached, everyone froze, even Nan Hua Xianjun raised his eyebrows slightly.

It was the old man’s appearance:

Though his hair was white, his face was aged, and his back was hunched, dressed in tattered linen clothes, his left arm was a furry tiger limb! The tiger claw was struggling to hold onto a stick for support, used to help his empty left leg!

His right arm and leg, though present, were frighteningly emaciated!

Indeed, this old man's left side was fundamentally abnormal! If the villagers looked like this, it would make sense to call it the Monster Village.

Lin Yu noticed the restrictions on magical abilities here weren't as strong, so he transmitted a message to Gan Lanlan: 

“Little Junior Sister, I did a check; it seems his tiger arm is congenital.”

“Congenital might not go that far, but… it really does seem like a part of his body.”

The blood circulation was intact, which was abnormal.

“It’s me. Baocun, you’ve returned?”

“Chief, I’m back! What brings you here?”

“Isn’t it because I was worried you wouldn’t find your way home? I have nothing to do; I just come to check periodically. I didn’t expect to really see you today.”

Saying that, he smiled. Though Chief Dayong looked quite strange, that smile was quite genuine.

“Chief…” Tears sparkled in Wei Baocun’s eyes, feeling the warmth of being missed by family, which was lovely!

“Baocun, who are these?”

Wiping away his tears, he said, “Chief, let me introduce you. These are the immortals I met outside; they’re here to help us!”

Looking at the five individuals before him, Chief Dayong could tell they were no ordinary people. Seeing his peculiar appearance, there was no hint of disrespect or disdain in their eyes, and he quietly felt relieved.

“Welcome to our humble and remote village. If you don’t mind, please follow me!”
