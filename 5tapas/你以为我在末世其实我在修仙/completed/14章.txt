**Infrastructure Relies on Everyone**

【The Sugarcane Community has begun to take shape, equipped with basic facilities, rewarding 3,000 energy points. Current total energy: 13,100 points.】

Lying on the sofa resting, with sleepy eyes, Lillian Gan thought to herself:  
"It was not in vain to build a bathhouse, public restroom, shared charging station, and cafeteria!"

Early in the morning, as she watched a group of people walking towards her from afar, Hao Guansheng, who hadn't slept a wink all night, revealed a long-lost smile.  
Dr. Hua and the others were older after all; although they had gone to bed late, they were used to rising early and had already begun their morning exercises.

Thinking about what she witnessed last night, the ground shook again, and even though she could see the distant buildings collapse, inside the room, they felt no sway or biting cold.  
However, Dr. Hua noticed that when there was an earthquake while constructing a building, one could still feel the shaking...  
Lillian explained, "Houses that are not yet fully constructed do not possess the strongest stability."

Nonetheless, at this moment, they were incredibly grateful and fortunate. When Lillian was finally awoken by the boisterous sounds, she frowned and looked at her watch; it was already past 9 o'clock!  
Looking down from the window, she was surprised to see a crowd gathered.

Hao Guansheng and the others were organizing the crowd for check-in: those who had visible energy or could provide qualifying resources, such as seeds, vegetables, fruits, or rare plants and animals, could unlock permissions and follow the guidance to find a house.  
In the end, there were still a few people left without energy or resources, including some of Hao's old comrades.

"Old Guan, we..."  
"It's fine, you can check the tasks posted next door. You should take on a few tasks. And for the locals, please adhere to the rules; otherwise, you will be blacklisted and will never be able to enter the community."

【Sugarcane Community Task Board】  
【1. Build the community: Constructing two houses earns 1 energy point, settled daily.】  
【2. Work on the farm/ranch: 1 energy point per day, settled daily. If there are experienced masters, salary can be negotiated.】

【6. Go outside to collect various resources; the system will determine task completion based on submitted materials, granting 1 energy point and commission based on resources collected.】  
【7. Special abilities: Please consult the community owner in person for details.】  
【All work has a probation period; if unsuitable, other arrangements will be made. Tasks will be updated irregularly; ownership of tasks belongs to the community owner, and any disputes should be resolved independently. Those who do not comply with community rules will be blacklisted and will not be accepted into the community.】

Fortunately, on the first day, the number of people was not too large; most people were still in a wait-and-see state; otherwise, there wouldn’t be enough houses.  
That day, the community established a basic patrol team, zombie elimination squads, and medical staff… in short, everything was moving in a positive direction.  
On the first day, the community owner even provided free meals for everyone and opened public facilities like the bathhouse, allowing everyone to have a rare good night's sleep.

With the increase in population, they clearly felt that the number of zombies surrounding them was growing; thankfully, everyone had already prepared for this.  
The temperature outside was also rising, and even though many people moved into the Sugarcane Community, they were still inquiring about the outside situation.  
Occasionally, they would hear from the broadcast that some safe bases had appeared outside, but the journey was filled with too many uncertainties, and everyone was afraid to act recklessly.  
Each person had their own choices; as the community owner, Lillian only wanted to work hard to expand the base.

Now that the ranch and farm were slowly taking shape, the entire base was continuously extending outward.  
As the base grew, they encountered some useful materials while clearing roadside obstacles and were able to collect even more. They couldn’t just rely on what they had.  
For instance, they discovered an empty little supermarket near the town, and after tidying it up, they found it had quite a bit of stock.  
Those who found the resources, according to community regulations, had to submit them to the warehouse except for a portion they kept for personal use.

At the same time, the community provided special jobs for a few particular individuals:
- Building a new reservoir to provide water for the base, with water manipulators responsible for gathering and producing water.  
- Fire manipulators helped provide kitchen fire and handled lighting at night.  
- Those with strong botanical affinity would cultivate plants and animals to stockpile food.  
- Individuals with strong offensive capabilities formed a guard unit to clear obstacles or go out to hunt zombies.  
- Space manipulators assisted in searching and storing resources.

As the community continued to grow, it began to resemble a proper base, and things were getting increasingly complicated. Lillian, finding many things tedious, delegated most tasks to Uncle Guan.  
Watching her energy points steadily increase, she knew she had more important things to do.  
As the entire base covered the town, many gazed at the familiar places that had been preserved and couldn’t help but cry.  
Seeing their former homes drastically changed, lamenting the unknown fate of loved ones, and feeling lost about the uncertain future.  
Unfortunately, communications were down, and the guard team did not dare venture far; they could only hope that someone from the outside would come to bring new news.  
Not far from the Sugarcane base, on a hill, several off-road vehicles were hidden, with someone using binoculars to observe the Sugarcane base.  
Beside him, a bald man bowing low handed a cigarette to the one-eyed leader.  
"Boss, have a smoke. What do you think of this little base?"  
The one-eyed man's eyes gleamed with ferocity as he surveyed the small town, running his fingers over his gun.  
"Not bad; we have been watching for quite a while now. This little base doesn’t have many abilities. The daily smoke rising indicates they don't lack resources. Hehe, I’ll take this base."
