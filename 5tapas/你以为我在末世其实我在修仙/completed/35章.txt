**Delicious!**

Perhaps fairies truly grow up drinking dew!

It wasn't sparse by any means; the eight-cornered pavilion was set with eight crystal platters, each one uniquely different. There were pink plum-shaped pastries, white square pastries, pastries that were half pink and half white, pastries drizzled with osmanthus honey, and so on… A grand gathering of pastries!

Oh, and besides that, there was a bowl of soup, crystal-clear and tender pink, topped with a layer of fresh plum blossoms!

These were undoubtedly the delicacies of fairies!

"Little junior sister, try this. It was prepared early this morning by senior sister. Since our master, senior brother, and younger brother don’t favor sweet foods, I figured you, as a girl, would surely enjoy them."

Looking at her senior sister's expectant gaze and recalling her own arrival at the sect, Gan Lanlan felt embarrassed to refuse.

All she could do was put on a smile and take a bite of each.

"Thank you, senior sister!" 

Seeing that her junior sister had already eaten half of the pastries, Wen Zhi could hardly contain her joy and asked, "Little junior sister, how is it? Tasty?"

The sweetness invaded her taste buds—it was indeed delicious, possibly with a hint of spiritual energy, leaving her feeling harmonious after the meal.

But… who eats pastries for a main course? It was simply too sweet!

"It’s tasty, senior sister." 

Wen Gu, who had somehow acquired a folding fan, was now waving it enthusiastically, embodying the spirit of someone who loves a good spectacle: "Little junior sister, if it’s good, you should have some more!"

"Senior brother, would you like to try some?"

Let’s all indulge in sweetness together, senior brother!

"No, no, no! This is specially prepared for the little junior sister by Zhi Zhi; senior brother doesn’t need to have any."

Gan Lanlan held out a platters that was not overly sweet: "This one isn’t sweet; senior brother, why not try it?"

Wen Gu gently pushed the platter away: "Senior brother has already entered a state of dietary abstinence and doesn’t require food; little junior sister, just enjoy!"

Gan Lanlan was persistent: "Senior brother should try it, it tastes really good! Senior sister worked hard to make this, and I can’t finish it all by myself."

She pushed the platter again: "Oh! This is specially made for you by your senior sister; how can senior brother take little junior sister’s food?"

…

Watching the two push back and forth for a while, Wen Zhi finally caught on. After all, she had typically seen such a playful back-and-forth between brothers and fathers, or between an older brother and a younger junior!

As for the master? He wasn't often at home!

"Is the pastry I made not good?" 

Oh no, even her beautiful senior sister's brows furrowed!

"It’s very well made; next time… maybe make a little less," she almost said, next time don’t make any!

"Senior sister, I can’t finish all of this; it’s just too much! I’m afraid of wasting your effort!" 

She patted her little belly to signal that she truly couldn’t eat anymore. 

The key issue was that eating these overly sweet goodies for a main meal was unbearable!

But she didn’t dare say that!

"Well, if there’s only one or two bowls, I worry that you might not be filled, so I made a little extra."

Wen Gu looked at her frustrated little sister and then glanced at her distressed junior sister, chuckling helplessly.

"Zhi Zhi, as a newly initiated disciple, you can go to the dining hall to obtain some spiritual rice, spiritual vegetables, and spiritual meat, and cook them like an ordinary family. These snacks, while nice to nibble on occasionally to sweeten the palate, simply won’t do as a meal."

Wen Zhi slapped her forehead, a bit annoyed: "Right! It’s my fault for not thinking it through! But brother, I… I only know how to make these pastries. Should I go learn from the senior sister who specializes in delicacies?"

As a senior sister, Wen Zhi was also troubled, especially since they had refrained from eating since they were little; making these fancy snacks was primarily due to their own spiritual energy. Cooking, on the other hand, was a whole different story—they really didn’t know how to do it!

Gan Lanlan quickly interjected: "No need, senior sister, I can cook. As long as there are ingredients available, cooking… is something you don’t need to trouble yourself with."

"That’s not acceptable! You’re still young..."

"Senior sister, I’m not a child anymore! I can cook, and if you don’t believe me, I can make you something to see!"

To ensure they believed her, she nodded emphatically: "Really, I’m not lying to you!"

Seeing that her sister was still hesitant, Wen Gu shook her head and intervened: "Then, Zhi Zhi, you should take the little junior sister to collect some food supplies. Don’t worry; little junior sister just arrived in the mountains and is not yet accustomed; you should help her familiarize herself with things first. As for food, you can ask other brothers and sisters in the mountain if they have solutions! For now, just let the little junior sister handle it herself!"

"Alright then!" 

"Big brother, take care!" 

"Senior brother, be careful!"

In the end, Gan Lanlan gained the autonomy to cook and, with her sister’s help, acquired her own small kitchen and pantry.

Seeing that Wen Zhi still looked a bit down, Gan Lanlan hurriedly approached her: "Senior sister, your pastries were delicious. Next time I want to eat them, can you make me another batch?"

That finally brought a smile to Wen Zhi’s face as she took Gan Lanlan to sort out the supplies: "Sure!" 

The so-called spiritual rice was merely a type of rice planted by specialists in the Lanshan Sect that held a bit of spiritual energy, perfectly suited for newly initiated disciples used to eating grains.

As for other supplies, they could almost all be exchanged for vegetables, fruits, pork, beef, mutton, fish, seafood that Gan Lanlan was familiar with, as well as some specialties from the cultivation world.

The downside? Not much oil.

According to the senior sister in charge of the supplies, aside from a few gluttons still in pursuit of gourmet food and wine, most people simply boiled ingredients in spiritual water and added some salt—quick and easy.

It must be said that the cultivation world certainly eats healthily, living up to its reputation.

Although they had consumed some sweets in the morning, they didn’t really fill one up.

Thus, Gan Lanlan was preparing to make her first meal in the cultivation world.

Speaking of first meals, her first meal during the apocalypse was also one she made herself! Such a frustratingly similar experience!

Forget it; picky eaters should just cook for themselves when there’s nothing good to eat!

Wen Zhi insisted on watching closely because she was worried Gan Lanlan might hurt herself.

The so-called small kitchen was only a name; it must be noted that Wanzhi Mountain was quite grand, having converted this space into a large and spacious kitchen.

After all, two pot burners already seemed quite large: one for steaming rice and the other for cooking meals.

There was also a small hanging pot nearby, useful for boiling water.

Gan Lanlan rendered some pig fat from the spiritual pig as a reserve; currently, there was no vegetable oil, so this meal would have to make do.

Looking at the spiritual pork, she felt there was no need to blanch it. She simply chopped the pork belly into pieces and tossed it into the pan for continuous stirring, adding a bit of white wine and ginger to remove the fishy smell until it became slightly golden and released oil. Then she pushed the meat to the side of the pan and added some sugar to caramelize it.

After mixing the pork in to coat it, she added a bit of soy sauce, and soon the aroma filled the kitchen.

Once it started to stick to the pot, she stopped stirring, added spiritual spring water to cover the pork, threw in some spices, and covered it to let it simmer while preparing the other ingredients.

One must admit, it truly lived up to its name as spiritual food; the smell was simply enticing.

Watching Gan Lanlan extract the oil herself, then stew the pork, and now she was cutting red vegetables.

At first, she was a bit worried her sister might cut herself, but seeing her skillfully slice potatoes into pieces, then into shreds, ginger into strips, and garlic crushed into bits, with the spiritual eggs whisked in…

Wen Zhi became even more fascinated; who knew cooking could be so meticulous!

The key point was… it really smelled great!
