**The Era of Chaos Has Passed, the Apocalypse Has Begun**

Lifting her right hand high, while tilting her left slowly, an amazing phenomenon unfolded. The endless field of sugarcane concentrated towards the right, morphing the once circular shield into a long groove. As the groove tilted, the meteorite began to sway slightly along with it.

“**Lanlan, your method works!**”  
“**That’s good to hear.**”  

The live broadcast, filmed in 360 degrees with aerial views, showed clearer perspectives than even the base personnel could see. As they watched Lanlan’s maneuvering, they finally understood that she intended to guide the depleted meteorite down the channel formed by the sugarcane.

No one dared to breathe, their eyes glued to the screen, hardly blinking. As the angle of inclination increased with the growing mass of sugarcane, the meteorite slowly began to move… eventually falling into an uninhabited area.

The reactions varied on the video feed; some were delighted, others invigorated! However, some remarked,  
“**We truly underestimated this Lanlan!**”

The moment the meteorite struck the ground, it seemed that Lanlan had exhausted all her strength, causing the sugarcane shield to slowly dissipate into the air, and she collapsed backward due to fatigue. In that fleeting moment before closing her eyes, she saw Guan Xin and Team Hua rushing toward her, along with a throng of people behind them.  
“Alright, I can rest easy now!”

This calamity, potent enough to ruin the entire network of the Hua base, was safely resolved at last! Yet, it exposed the entire sugarcane base to public scrutiny. But no one paid much mind to that, as the base leader—Lanlan—had been in a deep sleep for several days! Were it not for Dr. Hua assuring that she was merely exhausted and needed total silence and rest, even more people would have crowded outside her door!

The greatest threat in outer space had been dealt with. Although meteorite strikes still occurred globally, people had developed countermeasures and experience, preventing any catastrophic damage to Earth. Nowadays, people had grown accustomed to meteorites falling from the sky, much like rain.

Due to her unique abilities, Lanlan had garnered attention from various parties. Although she carried an extremely fragile life force, it wasn’t entirely absent. The once unnoticed aspect of her abilities started to attract more interest due to her powerful performance in the recent battle.

Fortunately, Lanlan had recovered well and woke up after a few days! However, she seemed… lazier this time. At first, it was because Hua’s mother and others believed she had suffered physical injuries, making sure she stayed in bed. After all, there’s a kind of “injury” that stems from elders feeling that you are hurt!

Forced into a life of idleness filled with snacks and leisure, she soon noticed that people quickly took up her responsibilities—Guan Xin and Team Hua handling all her laborious tasks—even moving chairs!

Aside from resting, there was nothing else she could do. What else could she do but continue repairing the damaged base and expanding the road network, striving to connect as much of the network to the globe as possible? It was said that Dr. Zhong was already researching plans for airport construction since long-distance land transportation was too slow!

There was another good piece of news: Si Si seemed to have upgraded recently. To be honest, while Si Si was an intelligent system, it wasn’t omnipotent. Many times, it could only assist as a tool rather than solve problems directly. Therefore, how to utilize the resources of the Star Network to allow the base to thrive amidst chaos was an issue for Lanlan to consider.

Moreover, the so-called apocalypse outside was merely labeled as “chaos” within the system! If the end times truly were upon them? No one knew what might happen next! The only way forward was to continuously enhance humanity’s chances of survival.

As confirmed allies, Lanlan and Dr. Zhong had discussed this issue after system connectivity. They both agreed that they might soon face even greater dangers. During this period, Lanlan had also purchased many items in the enhanced space.

Ultimately, it was best to be prepared!

The headquarters of Hua Country was quite far from the sugarcane base, which notably resembled a secret grain reserve nurtured by Hua Country. To avoid exposing the secrets of the sugarcane base, Dr. Zhong’s research team garnered international attention, with the world mostly focused on the Hua Country headquarters!

Additionally, her previous acquisition of space had expanded several times with the ongoing system upgrade, now suitable for agricultural and livestock development. In short, it could support life!

To achieve this, Lanlan immensely invested in a high-fidelity sun that hung in the air, permitting her to control the space’s design and construction with mere thoughts.  
“**Si Si, this space seems to have an upgrade feature!**”  
“**Yes, indeed!**”  
“**If its previous owner is still around, they must have been powerful?**”  
“**Correct. The previous system settings ranked users by strength, with top-ranking individuals being the strongest. However, to maintain equilibrium in power, the construction materials we were given might seem simple, yet they are of superior quality compared to other systems, more durable and effective!**”  
“**Hmm, Dr. Zhong mentioned this before... I wonder what the other fighters are skilled in and if we will encounter them in the future?**”  
“**That’s uncertain. If we haven't interacted, we cannot deduce whether the other party possesses a system!**”  
“**No worries, we’ll figure it out when the time comes. Our immediate goal is to build the base properly.**”  
“**Exactly. We aim to create the most remarkable base in this era of chaos, hehe.**”  
“**Si Si, the most remarkable base... you really overestimate me!**”  
“**Not at all, Lanlan, you’re the best, and the sugarcane base is the best!**”  
“**Alright, alright, amazing, amazing… let’s get to work!**”  

With that, she closed her eyes. Although many tasks no longer required her direct involvement, they were incredibly mentally taxing. Coupled with the exhaustion she had yet to recover from, she often found herself dozing off during work. 

As a result, the people at the base believed their leader had become even lazier, often finding her asleep while sitting.

In the early days of chaos, various natural disasters frequently appeared, but gradually settled down. Yet recently, people became increasingly uneasy, with even the small animals at the sugarcane base showing signs of agitation. 

Strange occurrences were evident, notably the drastic day-to-night temperature variations:  
During the day, the sun scorched the earth unbearably; at night, ice formed on the ground!  
Slowly, even the zombies struggled against the natural calamities!

There were even reports of zombies spontaneously combusting due to the daytime heat!  
In less than five years of this chaotic era, environmental conditions had deteriorated significantly!

Only a few dozen bases worldwide were still holding up. In a fight for survival, people continued to gather and migrate toward these bases. Everywhere, things scorched to spontaneous combustion, ashes scattering in the air, creating a sky that seemed blackened.

As time progressed, nights grew longer, and days short, forcing people to hide away in their bases. The changes in the natural environment cultivated a profound despair that eclipsed the threat posed by zombies. Perhaps, if they had the capacity for thought, the zombies shared this despair too.

The base constructed by Lanlan and her team was even beginning to extend underground.

The eras of chaos had indeed passed!  
But the apocalypse was just beginning!
