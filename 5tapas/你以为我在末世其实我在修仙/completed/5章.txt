**One Meat Dish, One Vegetable Dish, and a Pot of Tea**

Just as before, a batch of materials was neatly arranged behind the house. Clara Gan diligently laid the flooring first along the back of the house, then she slowly built the walls. Finally, using the ladder she had saved earlier, she finished up by covering the roof.

Standing inside the empty but bright warehouse, she suddenly felt a sense of satisfaction; she finally had a new place to call her own.

Connecting the handle to the wall of the house, a door automatically appeared. As she opened it, she saw the familiar room again.

Taking a break, she was relieved that no one was around to notice her building operations. Clara wanted to move her sleeping area to the second floor, at least ensure the stairs were ready for access. Climbing onto the roof, she found a neat stack of materials waiting for her.

**[Task Two] Completed, Reward: 10 energy points. Current Total Energy: 14 Points.**  
Even with the new updates in the shop, she still couldn’t afford anything, but oh well, time to keep working hard.

A bad feeling brewed inside her. Clara believed the system was reliable; even though this little system, named Si Si, seemed quite basic and didn’t help much, it mostly just watched around the star network quietly without causing a fuss. 

She continued building walls and putting on the roof.

*If only building houses were always this easy,* Clara thought.

**[Task One] Completed, Reward: 10 energy points. Current Total Energy: 24 Points.**  
**[Task Three] Completed, Reward: 10 energy points. Current Total Energy: 34 Points.**  
**[Phase Task Completed, Reward: 5 energy points. Current Total Energy: 39 Points.]**  
**[New Task Activated: The supplies in the warehouse will eventually run out. To ensure sustainable long-term development, focus on agriculture and animal husbandry.]**  
**[Task One] Build a farm.**  
**[Task Two] Collect plants and compile a plant library.**  
**[Task Three] Gather poultry and livestock for the animal library.**  
Though new tasks were issued, looking out at the increasingly darkening sky, Clara felt a sudden jolt of fear as a lightning bolt illuminated the horizon, making everything seem even more ominous. She dared not step outside at night.

It was better to take a breather and treat herself to a decent meal.

She cooked a pot of rice; fortunately, Boss Guan had everything she needed: a tomato, a green chili pepper, an egg, and half of the frozen chicken wings she had defrosted earlier.

After scoring some shallow cuts in the chicken wings, she heated the oil in a pan and fried the wings until they turned slightly golden on both sides. Then she pushed them to the side, adding a bit more oil, ginger, minced garlic, and dried chili to release their aroma before mixing everything together. A splash of cooking wine, a bit of vinegar, some five-spice powder, star anise, a dash of light soy sauce, and a touch of dark soy sauce were added and stirred well. Next, she added enough water to cover the wings and covered the pot to simmer.

With the tomato and green pepper chopped and the egg beaten, Clara brewed a pot of tea using a packet she had purchased casually at Guan Xin’s shop.

Lastly, she added the green peppers to the chicken wings, sprinkled in salt, and reduced the sauce before plating.

Washing the pot, she warmed oil, then stir-fried the tomato and green pepper. Once the tomato softened, she poured in the beaten egg, stirred it briefly, added salt, a splash of water, and let it reduce before plating.

Although frying the eggs first would have looked better, doing it this way made them soak up more flavor, and it went perfectly with the rice.

So, with a plate of one meat dish, one vegetable dish, and a pot of tea, Clara felt happier than she had in days.

Energized, she glanced at her cramped room, thinking about finally having a larger space, and she smiled with contentment.

“Si Si, I’d like to rearrange the upstairs and downstairs. Is there an automatic organization system?”

“Clara, the dual-layer system you purchased comes with a free gift; you should check it out!”

“Huh? A gift? Let me see… Wow, Si Si, this looks amazing! It’s a whole set of room furnishings! This bed looks so comfy, and there’s a big wardrobe too! This carpet looks so cozy. And wow, there’s a bathtub and a vanity. I can’t believe it! This is wonderful! Love you, Si Si!”

“Hehe, you’re welcome, Clara!”

“Well then, I can transform the downstairs into a living room, even though I don’t have any guests. I see there's a special offer in the system; I can change it to a living room for just 1 point. I’ve been eyeing that for a while!”

“Yeah, the system often has discounts to clear away things that aren’t needed.”

Uh, do you really call a big sofa, a floor-to-ceiling window, an open kitchen, and a double-door refrigerator things that aren’t needed? 

Well, in that case, the more unneeded things, the better.

Thus, to remodel both levels only cost her 1 point, which was a fantastic deal.

“Alright, Si Si, please install it for me.”

“Sure thing!”

**[1 energy point deducted. Current total energy: 38 points.]**  
As she looked at the carpet beneath her feet, glancing in the mirror while ignoring her disheveled appearance, she excitedly rushed downstairs, ready to welcome her new floor-to-ceiling window.

The bay window was in place, but the living room didn’t show any noticeable changes.

“Si Si, what's going on? Is there a malfunction? The downstairs hasn’t changed at all!”

“Clara, because the downstairs items weren’t moved out, new ones can’t be placed. All of those items you bought are still here. Unless you throw them away, they’ll remain. But since they’re new, I suggest you move them to the warehouse or spend 5 points to automatically relocate them to the warehouse.”

Clara facepalmed; what kind of choice was that?

“I’ll move them myself.”

After all, a worker has to work for their points.

“Clara, these are easy to move since they are all standalone items. Plus, look, I’ve removed the wall. You can push everything through!”

That was fantastic; the wall between the living room and the warehouse could be retracted. How convenient!

“Thank you so much, Si Si!”

“You’re welcome! Hehe!” 

From a brick mover to a pusher, Clara sighed as she tackled her little remodel.

Once she pushed away the last chair and turned around, she noticed the wall had returned again.

Coming from the doorway, she gazed at her now ten-times more comfortable living room and suddenly felt that all the hard work wasn’t so bad after all.

Though, the empty fridge did seem rather out of place.

Starting a new round of organizing, she brought over the things she would need. It was shaping up quite well.

When she finished showering and lay down on her bed, she felt a sense of peace as if she could sleep soundly no matter the winds of fortune around her.
