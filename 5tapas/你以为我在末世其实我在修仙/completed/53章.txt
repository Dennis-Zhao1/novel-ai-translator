**Fan City**

"Disciple Gan Lianlan, paying respects to Master Nan Hua!"

"Master Nan Hua? ...Ah~ I thought he looked familiar!"

Lin Yu hurriedly caught the whip that was about to fall to the ground and quickly bent down, shouting loudly, "Disciple Lin Yu, paying respects to Master Nan Hua!"

"We, Wei Bao Village, also pay our respects to Master Nan Hua!" Wei Bao Village members followed suit. After all, being with the immortal master was definitely not a mistake!

Even the Wen siblings, who were in the carriage, were shocked into silence and quickly stood up to pay their respects!

Not forgetting to shoot an eye-dagger at their junior disciple, they thought, "Our idol is here; why didn't you call out to your seniors!"

Lin Yu felt very wronged, "The idol came too suddenly; I couldn't react in time!"

Master Nan Hua flew down from the tree, landing gracefully in front of them.

"Where are you all planning to go?"

He glanced at Wei Bao Village and remarked, "He doesn't seem to be one of my disciples?"

As the garrulous senior brother, it was only natural for him to step forward and respond!

Moreover, this was the idol asking the question!

Last time in the secret realm didn't count; he was too busy worrying about the senior sisters and didn't even get a chance to chat with his idol. By the time he realized it, his idol had already left!

He regretted it, especially as Haizi laughed at him!

This time, he had to at least say three sentences to his idol!

"Answering Master, we disciples are descending the mountain on the master’s orders to train and solidify our cultivation. This brother from Wei Bao Village— we're going to investigate something in their village, so we are traveling together."

"Hmm, if that's the case, I happen to need to look into a few things too, so I’ll travel with you!"

"Ah?"

Although being close to the idol offered ample bragging rights when he returned to boast to Haizi!

But what did a few insignificant disciples like them have that was worth the immortal master wanting to join them?

Could it be... that the idol knew his junior sister could cook well?

Was someone else coming to fight him for food?!

Gan Lianlan exchanged glances with the others, all pondering how to refuse!

"What's wrong? Can't I go?"

"No, of course you can go..."

"Well then, let’s get in the carriage!"

And just like that, they were compelled to travel with Master Nan Hua.

If Lianlan were to describe the feeling, it was as if her idol insisted on experiencing country life with her!

Should they serve him well, or serve him well?

Ridiculous!

What was supposed to be a training journey was turning into an effort to cater to a deity!

Lianlan attempted a final struggle, "Master, the carriage is quite small..."

"No problem!" 

With a wave of his sleeve, the once cramped carriage turned spacious, complete with a soft couch!

But the exterior of the carriage remained unchanged!

One last effort:

"Um... the place we are heading to has strict restrictions that suppress cultivation; it might not be suitable for the master."

"I haven't gone out to train in a long time; it is precisely the time to see the world."

"…"

This was hard to deal with; they gave up!

Master Nan Hua thoughtfully added, "When out, just call me Sir Nan."

Saying this, he walked directly to the couch and closed his eyes to rest!

This idol… was somewhat self-centered!

The senior and junior disciples agreed, "We can’t deal with this, nor do we want to!"

"But this is our idol! How could it be bad to train with him?"

Fortunately, he wouldn’t interfere with their activities most of the time!

Always quiet and perpetually resting!

Lin Yu and Wei Bao Village occupied the carriage’s front seat while the other three begrudgingly sat with the idol.

Wen Gu sat upright, not daring to casually play his instrument or read, expressing, "Though being with the idol is exciting, it leads to feeling a bit constrained. It’s been a long time since I felt this kind of discipline!"

Even though the idol hadn’t said a word!

Everyone just didn’t dare to move freely.

Finally, an opportunity came!

"Ahem, ahead is Fan City; after such a long journey, we should take a break."

Seeing that Master Nan Hua showed no intention of engaging with them, Wen Zhi quickly chimed in, "Really? Brother, we've finally arrived at Fan City?"

Gan Lianlan wanted to chime in but had no idea what to say!

It was too awkward; might as well force some small talk:

"Ah? Senior brother, you already knew we were nearing Fan City? Is it famous?"

"… It’s not that well-known! I just did a little homework before leaving; traveling in this direction, it’s the only larger town we’ll pass through."

"Oh, I see!"

"Ah, so that's how it is!"

Wen Gu signaled with his eyes: Speak more so I don’t crack under pressure!

"… So, Senior Brother, is there any good food or fun things in Fan City?"

"Good food and fun? Not really… nothing special!"

"…"

Sorry, Senior Brother; I did my best but didn’t know what else to say!

The awkward conversation hit a dead end!

Just then, Lin Yu’s voice came from outside:

"We’ve arrived at Fan City! Everyone, let’s get out of the carriage and enter the city!"

The voice was like music to their ears!

Yu’er/Senior Brother, I’ll definitely praise you well today!

As the words fell, Lin Yu saw his typically procrastinating senior brother and sister quickly scramble out!

They appeared somewhat eager, even giving him an appreciative look, which left Lin Yu puzzled!

The guards at the gate stopped the carriage:

"Entering the city, 20 coins per person."

Wei Bao Village was taken aback, "20 coins??? So expensive?"

Forgive him, a poor person who could buy a bun for just 1 coin; 20 coins was a fortune!

"Are you all together? Six people, 120 coins."

Gan Lianlan tugged at Junior Brother’s sleeve, "Junior Brother, do you have any money?"

Lin Yu whispered back, "I don’t have money!"

"…"

Wrong person to ask! This child was unreliable!

They didn’t notice someone behind them casting a vague glance at the hand pulling Lin Yu.

A silver ingot was tossed in, "No need for change."

Indeed, the reliable senior brother had plenty of wealth; he was perfect for travel... 

Seeing Wen Gu's confidence, the guards stepped aside and let them through.

"Let’s go!"  

With that, Wen Gu led the way, eager to put some distance between himself and the carriage for now.

The others followed along, even Master Nan Hua, with a nonchalant expression, slowly folded his arms and walked behind.

Meanwhile, Wei Bao Village happily took hold of the reins and couldn’t help but pat the horse’s head.

Since the immortal master entrusted this valuable steed to him, he must take good care of it!

Finding a decent inn, they booked rooms and had the staff settle the carriage, then everyone agreed to explore the night market. 

Before going, they made sure to check with the idol sitting with his arms crossed:

"Sir Nan, we plan to go for a stroll; what do you think?"

Master Nan Hua thought for a moment: "I haven’t wandered around in a long time; let’s go together!"

Thus, the six-person group headed out to the night market!

Even though the idol followed at a distance behind, it felt much more relaxed than being inside the carriage!

*

No matter where, the night market was bustling with energy!

Seeing Gan Lianlan curiously looking around, Wen Zhi gently took her hand:

"Is this your first time at a mortal night market, Junior Sister?"

"… Yes!"

If we consider this Gan Lianlan from this world, besides being dragged to the Lan Mountain Sect for the grand event, she really hadn’t been out!

Most likely, she had only played in her yard before!

"Then we'd better explore; there's plenty of fun stuff in the mountains."

"Okay!"

In the meantime, Lin Yu, who forgot to bring any money down the mountain, started pestering his senior brother for travel funds:

"Brother, good brother! We need to have some spending money for the night market!"

Wen Gu shook his head; after all, he was just helpful by nature!

Travel funds had to be arranged—he first handed out a pouch of silver!

Not leaving out Wei Bao Village, making them become increasingly nervous:

"Mr. Wen, I can't accept this!"

"Take it; consider it a reward for your hard work driving us! If you don’t want it, just toss it away!"

"Mr. Wen…"

In the end, Wei Bao Village tearfully accepted it. Immortal masters truly were good people! 

Wen Gu didn’t bother with him afterward and walked over to offer the largest pouch to the loitering idol!

Everyone had one, so it was only right to prepare one for the idol!

As they walked, they turned a corner!

Wen Gu dragged Gan Lianlan over, quickly placing the pouch in her hand, signaling:

"Deliver this to our idol!"

Gan Lianlan exclaimed, "Senior Brother, I’m still a child! You don’t dare go, and I dare even less!"

Wen Gu reassured her, "You’re still young; the idol won't mind! The task is assigned to you. I’m leaving; you can do it!"

"Hey!!!"

Watching her senior brother leave without looking back, Gan Lianlan felt the "favoritism" from him!
