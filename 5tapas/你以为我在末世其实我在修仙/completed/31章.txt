**Ranshan Sect's Grand Recruitment**

The Ranshan Sect, enveloped in swirling clouds and mist, stands as the foremost sect in the world of immortals. Its most notable characteristic compared to other sects is simple: it's vast! The territory of Ranshan Sect is immense, perpetually shrouded in fog, making it impossible to see the mountain's peak—imbuing it with an air of mystery.

The number of disciples in Ranshan Sect has always been a secret. It seems that wherever one goes in the realm of cultivation, there are disciples of Ranshan Sect. But that's another story! Unlike other sects that may expand only once every few years or even decades, Ranshan Sect holds major recruitment every year.

Divided into various smaller departments based on different mountain ranges, anyone who passes the trial can join Ranshan Sect. For ordinary folks living at the foot of the mountains, participating in the recruitment means that even if they don’t become an immortal teacher, just being a simple disciple responsible for chores could secure them a care-free life.

Thus, when recruitment time comes around each year, it’s the most lively occasion in the cultivation world! A crowd gathered in front of the grand gates of Ranshan Sect, waiting for the recruitment to officially begin, passing the time by chatting.

"Hey, Brother Da Niu, you’re here again this year?" 

"Yeah, Brother Goudan, are you also bringing your younger kin?" 

"Yes! These little brats wouldn’t see the path to Ranshan Sect without my guidance. The clan leader insisted that I take them along. It’s a long journey. We set off from the village three months ago, and look, we just made it in time." 

"I can relate. If I hadn’t discovered Ranshan Sect back in the day, our village wouldn’t even know such a wonderful place existed. We left the village two months ago, bringing along these young lads and ladies to give it a shot. Even if they just become simple cleaning disciples, it’s like stepping into the immortal realm and bringing glory to our family! Hey Goudan, didn’t one of your clan members get accepted last year?"

"Ah, yes! My cousin’s little boy got selected! Our clan values Ranshan Sect’s recruitment now; every year, they send me to bring eligible children! Although the journey is tough, it’s worth it!" 

"Right! Just like our village chief says, try hard and even a country dog can turn into a celestial crane!" 

"Indeed! Hahaha, Brother Da Niu, why did you bring a beggar with you?" 

"This isn’t from our village—ah, it’s a pitiful story!" He lowered his voice, "You don’t know this, coming from the north, but we’re from the south, right? We passed by the kind-hearted Mr. Gan’s place on our way. We hoped to just get a sip of water, but the Gan family is so generous! Upon seeing us exhausted, they offered us food and clothes." 

With a sigh, he continued, "But by the time we trekked for a while, Er Niu said he saw flames where we thought we could stay. By the time we returned, there was nothing left to salvage." 

He gestured toward the "little beggar," indicating the child pretending to be quiet. 

"When we returned, we found this fainted child. We really had nowhere to put him, so we figured we might as well bring him along to the immortal gate to see if he could try his luck. If he fails the trial, we’ll see if he has other places he wants to go, or we can take him back to the village. After all, raising a child in the village is no big deal; it’s just an extra mouth to feed." 

"That’s indeed unfortunate. Has he said anything?" 

Da Niu glanced at the dazed little beggar sitting in the cart, noticing that besides Er Niu, no one dared approach him. 

"Guess the shock was too much. His clothes got burned, and he wouldn’t let us near him. At least he can still eat… otherwise, I’d be at a loss." 

"Right, how pitiful. But let’s go with the flow. If he’s lucky and can enter the immortal gate, that’d be a good thing!" 

Seeing a few of his clan members playing around, he felt he needed to keep an eye on them so they wouldn't cause trouble at the sect. 

"I’ll check up on our little ones causing mischief. You take care, Goudan, I have to look into the registration situation." 

The ragged, soot-blackened, vacant-eyed little beggar was pulled along by Er Niu toward the trial grounds. The other children initially ignored the little beggar; eventually, they lost interest in him, so only Er Niu kept close to him.

When their turn to register came, Da Niu led the group of children to sign up. When it was Er Niu’s turn, he eagerly rushed forward and proclaimed loudly, "I’m Er Niu Wang from Niutou Village. My mom is the village head’s daughter—she sent me here. This kid behind me is… Gan Gan Gan…"

Er Niu thought for a moment and then his eyes lit up, "Gan Fan! His name is Gan Fan! Sweet like 'Gan' and 'Fan' means rice!" 

Er Niu remembered how his mother always said that getting a good meal was most important, so he creatively came up with a name for the little beggar who couldn’t speak.

"Gan Fan! Sounds great!" Er Niu thought proudly, his dark face glowing with delight as if he had accomplished something grand.

The recorder paused for a moment, but being seasoned in such affairs, he wrote, "Er Niu Wang," followed by "Gan Fan."

Once they finished registering, they could enter the trial grounds. There, designated immortals would guide each participant to their assigned cushion, waiting for the trial bell to ring.

As for the trial content, opinions varied widely. In summary, it was a test of the heart. Every person’s experience would be different, as each individual's perception shapes their experience, creating unique manifestations in this trial realm.

Those who passed the trial would be assigned to specific hilltops, entering different sects, led by senior brothers and sisters who would guide them into the fold. Those who did not pass would remain on the square until Ranshan Sect declared the recruitment concluded, after which they would need to leave on their own.

Causing trouble? Unthinkable! Although Ranshan Sect is known for its apathy, it's an incredibly powerful sect. Legend has it that the origin of immortal cultivation began in Ranshan Sect! There's also talk of a once-renowned immortal challenging the sect, only to be swiftly defeated by a single move—so fast that no one could discern who took action!

Regarding the pass rate, it entirely depends on the inherent qualities of those participating in the trial each year. Some hilltops see many entrants every year, as even those of moderate talent can often gain entry, particularly for those cleaning disciples—a multitude exists. However, rarer talents are a real treasure, sought after not just in Ranshan Sect, but throughout the entire cultivation world!

During the recruitment, special celestial beings oversee the entire trial area from above. From the air, a blanket of little black dots resembles a swarm of ants. 

Concerned about visibility from afar? Not for these immortals! Should they wish, even if a participant’s eyes dart around wildly, they can see clearly. Besides, some significant figures from the sect closely monitor and even participate in the tests.

As the trial bell rang, everyone in the trial grounds instinctively closed their eyes, entering an enigmatic trial scene. In time, those monitoring from the air would notice participants vanishing from their cushions. Until the trial ended, those still seated indicated they had not passed and would essentially need to pack up and return home.

In a small corner of the trial area, a frail little beggar found himself amidst the trial. It felt like he was having an endless dream; beneath his eyelids, his eyes stirred restlessly, faster and faster… until suddenly, he opened his eyes.

However, before he could make sense of his surroundings, his figure vanished from the trial square.
