**They Are Not Monsters, But Survivors**

Watching the food conjured up by the master, and seeing the cheerful children of the village serving dishes and porridge to the elderly, the village head of Tiger Arm Village felt an overwhelming sense of anticipation! Maybe, just maybe, they could live a life different from the one they currently had!

As he observed the lively scene before him, he couldn’t help but reflect: for so many years, the village had never been this vibrant, akin to the joyous celebrations of the New Year from his memories! Back then, they would roam and play in the brightly lit night markets...

“Village Head, can I ask you something?” 

He was jolted from his thoughts by the voice of Clara Joy. Wiping his eyes with his good hand, he responded with a smile, “Ah, master! Feel free to ask anything!”

Looking at the elderly gathering together to learn about the outside world from the village of Wei Bao, Clara asked, “Is this all the people left in the village?”

“Yes, everyone’s right here. There used to be over 300 people, but many have passed away due to sickness, and the elderly have gone as well... Now, only 21 of us old folks remain!”

“My condolences! I heard from Wei Bao Village that you were once ordinary people?” 

With a sigh, the village head, Da Yong, exhibited a nostalgic expression. “Indeed, we were originally just common folk from South City. If it weren’t for the invasion from the foreign Yamato tribe, which led to the massacre of South City and our capture for ‘experiments,’ we wouldn’t have ended up like this—not quite human, not quite ghost!”

“So, you mean to say that after the massacre of the city, you were captured for human experiments, which transformed you into what you are now?” 

Da Yong paused, taken aback. Although some words were unfamiliar, he felt that Clara’s assertion was correct. “Yes.”

Wen Gu, who had come along to gather more details, couldn’t help but comment, “I never imagined you would be survivors of the South City Massacre.”

“Oh, senior brother, you know about this?” 

“Yes, while we don’t often concern ourselves with events in the valley below, the South City Massacre had far-reaching implications and involved those who practice cultivation, so we’ve heard some stories.”

Wen Zhi and Lin Yu nodded in agreement, with Wen Zhi adding, “Yes, back then the Yamato tribe invaded South City, killing over 300,000 citizens, many of whom were cultivators! I remember this incident stirred the entire cultivation community, which led to the implementation of cultivation restrictions to protect the mortals.”

“Was there originally a presence of cultivators in South City?” Da Yong’s response weighed heavily on Wen Gu’s mind. If even cultivators couldn’t resist, how powerful was the enemy?

“Indeed, master, South City was once a prominent coastal city—busy, thriving, and rich in resources favorable for cultivation. Thus, many cultivators took up residence there, and the city was once very renowned!” As he spoke, a glimmer of pride could be felt, soon dimming as he continued, “But alas, it also attracted the covetous eyes of the Yamato tribe! They were well-prepared, and with the help of a powerful dark entity, even with cultivators banding together, we could not hold them off! Before long, the Yamato tribe took South City!”

“Once they breached the city, they began by capturing all the cultivators, and before the eyes of the entire populace, they executed them at the city gates as a warning against resistance.”

Although Lin Yu had some knowledge of the South City Massacre, he was still shocked to hear those details. “Not even the cultivators were spared? What kind of dark entity empowered them to that extent?”

“We do not know what it was, only that it appeared as a swirling dark mass, like a ghost. The cultivators were no match for it! It is said to have originated from the Western world; the specifics are beyond the comprehension of us mortals.”

So, this was linked to the Western world as well—though she didn’t know if it meant the same thing she understood!

“Please, continue!”

“After the Yamato tribe wiped out the cultivators, they were not finished! Fearing that the young and vigorous men might resist, they began to seize the men from each household—young boys, the elderly, even the old men—any man they could find! My father and brother were taken during that time. I was young, and my father hid me in the cellar, allowing me to escape a calamity.”

It was as if recalling a terrible memory, the village chief’s hands shook. “When I later grew extremely hungry, I snuck out, only to see... my father and many citizens of South City tied to the posts at the city gate. And those Yamato beasts were... they were holding a contest for the most kills!”

Even the Wen siblings, who were somewhat aware of the South City massacre, were astonished at these details. “A contest for kills?”

“Yes! They competed to see who could kill the most!”

“I saw from a distance as their blades stabbed into my father and brother one after another! Then, those beasts! They beheaded my brother to prove their power! There was no chance to save them!”

With that, he closed his eyes; the long-buried images were too much to bear. The villagers had begun to gather around, drawn by the voices.

“Yes! I can never forget the wails that echoed throughout South City and the unshakable smell of blood!... By midnight, when a few of us tried to gather the bodies of our family members, we could no longer find a single whole person!”

At this moment, a tearful one-eyed grandmother also spoke up, “Yes, my brother was also lost at that time. Aside from his head, I searched everywhere, my hands soaked in blood, but I couldn’t find his body anywhere!”

Beside her, a figure so battered that gender was unrecognizable, believed to be an elderly man, began to speak. “I was responsible for collecting the bodies during that time. There were batches upon batches of dead... The Yamato tribe didn’t have enough hands, so they captured us laborers to help move and bury the bodies. We were forced to dig vast pits outside the city to bury everyone! Back then, there were hardly any intact corpses left…”

Da Yong struggled against his sorrow and murmured, “Yes! Even so, they didn’t stop! With no more cultivators to capture, and unable to find any men, they began to catch everyone. Men, women, the elderly, the young—anyone they laid eyes on, they would seize or kill!”

An elderly woman who had lost her hands could no longer contain her grief. “Woe is me, my dear mother! My dear brother! My dear sister! All killed by those beasts! Woe is me~”

Seeing the elderly crying uncontrollably, Clara Joy hurried over to comfort her, wiping away her tears and secretly funneling some spirit energy into her to prevent her from fainting from the shock.

Perhaps they had truly suppressed their feelings for too long; now that the elderly had someone to confide in, they began to unveil the darkness they had once faced, bit by bit.

Recalling those events now made the grandmother tremble with emotion. “We hid in our room, my mother heavily pregnant, when those beasts stormed in with bloodied knives! My mother tried to fight back, but we were too weak to resist; I was knocked unconscious on the bed! When I finally awoke... my elder sister lay next to me, violated, with no clothes left on her, bleeding profusely!

“I went to find my mother. She lay on the floor, devoid of clothing, with a bloody hole in her abdomen! And my newborn brother was in her arms, no longer breathing.

“I ran to her, crying out for her, for my brother, for my sister! But—all remained still! They were all dead. From that moment, I had no family! Woe is me!

“I barely survived, wanting to escape South City. I ran with some neighbors, starving and keeping on the run, but those beasts would not let us go! We were captured and kept for experiments…”

Listening to this, Clara Joy closed her eyes! She thought she might know what happened next. This resembled a notorious historical event she had learned about! History truly does repeat itself!

That night, everyone’s feelings flowed forth. The elderly, usually quiet, began to share their stories one after another. 

“We managed to escape outside the city, hiding in the grass, only for their hunting dogs to discover us! My mother and sister were both... they died outside, without peace! I was captured and forced into labor, eventually taken for experiments.”

“They skinned us, sewing animal hides onto our bodies. Many could not endure it and died; somehow, I managed to survive…”

“They said they wanted to see if they could graft animal limbs onto humans; they cut off my feet…”

“They forced us to take experimental drugs, it hurt so much! I wished to die, yet I lived on…”

“…”

Da Yong, too, was a victim of that time: “I was captured later and imprisoned with everyone in a dark, miserable place... They cut off my left arm and left leg, replacing them with this tiger arm, but my left leg succumbed and became useless!”

He touched his tiger arm, “Many of those subjected to these so-called ‘human experiments’ did not survive; only we remain alive! It wasn’t until one day someone opened the cage that held us that we finally saw the light of day again!”

He and the others smiled as they remembered that day, recalling the warm sunlight that crept in through the door, long forgotten!

It's a pity...

“But, looking like this means we can’t remain in South City... Everyone calls us monsters! No one wishes to accept us. Wherever we go, we’re met with strange stares, bullied, rejected, and beaten. We know that South City has long ceased to be our home!”

As he finished speaking, the Tiger Arm village head laughed at himself, “So, later, I led the remaining few hundred of us to flee deep into the mountains. We, these old monsters, have only survived until now!”
