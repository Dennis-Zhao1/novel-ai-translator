**Catastrophe Approaches**

Captain Hudson received a serious call from his superiors. After contemplating, he still made his way to the yard of Clara Lanlan.

As expected, he found Clara sitting on a swing chair, leisurely eating fruit and flipping through a book.

Seeing Captain Hudson approach, she waved at him.  
"Captain Hudson, want some oranges?"  
"No, thanks."  
"Oh, is there something you need?"  
"Yes, I just got some news."  
"Go on."  
She continued to snack on the oranges, which were incredibly sweet lately.

"Recently, mysterious meteorite attacks have been reported worldwide. Even the supposedly perfect base in the M Country was nearly compromised by a small meteorite, but they managed to repair it in time."  
Upon hearing this, Clara straightened up.  
"What about our country?"  
"Latest updates indicate that a newly constructed base was also hit. A meteorite struck it, and it's gone."  
This meant that even the materials produced by the system could not defend against incoming meteorites.

"Moreover, Dr. Chang sent a message saying that a cluster of unknown objects has been detected in outer space. They have been continuously bombarding the Earth lately. The doctor suspects this is just the beginning, and attacks will become more frequent, so he sent out an alert."  
"… I understand. We need to strengthen our defenses."  
"Agreed."

Watching Clara transition from her usual playful demeanor to a serious expression, Captain Hudson was accustomed to her independent thought process. 

Actually, at moments like this, Clara was communicating with her AI companion, Sisi.  
[Sisi, our base has been damaged. Do you have any feedback?]  
[Yes, but this time it’s irreversible damage... And I lost some energy points.]  
[Oh… So, Sisi, if such a danger occurs again, is there a way to predict it in advance?]  
[We can use energy points to activate the base's danger alert, but it costs quite a bit!]
[No worries, the cost is worth it!]  
Just as she finished her statement, a prompt sounded.  
[Base No. 222 has suffered a split due to internal conflict, resulting in personnel losses, deducting 10,000 energy points.]  
Wow, that was efficient! The human nature of greed and anger never changes!

[Warning, warning! An unidentified object has appeared in the southeastern sky of Base No. 236, expected to strike in 3 minutes!]  
Stunned, Clara thought, It’s coming so soon?!

She hurried to contact the main operator at Base No. 236, warning them of the impending danger and urging an evacuation within two minutes.  
Unfortunately, the other base didn’t take the message seriously and ultimately could not escape the disaster.  
It seemed that the alert system needed to be reported to the central government to function optimally… After all, her warnings might not be taken to heart.

Therefore, Clara reached out to Dr. Chang, sending him the system in hopes they could research ways to counter meteoric impacts.

As more regions faced crises, human society—having finally settled into some semblance of stability—began to panic again.  
Even though some areas could foresee dangers, they could at best only mitigate the severity of the disasters.  
Even the Sugar Cane Base had lost its previous vibrancy, as the base manager had instructed everyone to prepare for a possible evacuation at any moment:  
[Highest Alert for Sugar Cane Base: Upon disaster alert, all personnel must evacuate immediately!]  
[No matter what, evacuate immediately!]  
Fortunately, Dr. Chang soon conveyed news that certain natural life abilities could resist meteorite impacts.

It was reported that a natural life energy user had unleashed their abilities to save their child from a meteorite almost crashing down.  
Although they could only push it slightly, it was enough to save the child.  
Such abilities were rare and hard to identify.  
They were somewhat similar to botanical users, able to enhance plant growth but not entirely equivalent.  
The plants they nurtured had unique traits, with only a few documented instances.

But Clara was no stranger to this, as she happened to be a natural life energy user herself!  
The sugar cane she nurtured was the best proof—no other type of sugar cane possessed such strong defensive capabilities!

*

At the Sugar Cane Base, everyone was allowed to evacuate, except Clara!  
In fact, the base served as the core of the continent’s Internet of Things. If something happened here, the entire transportation network would collapse, putting more people in jeopardy.

When Sisi warned her that a massive meteorite was headed for the base, Clara felt a sense of inevitability settle within her.  
She had known this day might come, hadn't she?

The base alarm blared:  
[Highest Alert for Sugar Cane Base: All personnel must evacuate immediately!]  
[Evacuate immediately!]  
[Evacuate immediately!...]
The base was filled with ecstatic warnings and rushing crowds...

Uncle Guan quickly organized personnel to evacuate the base while he carried Grandma Hu toward the outskirts!  
Looking back, he saw that tiny familiar figure standing alone at the center of the square… oh, her slender silhouette!  
But he knew even if she stayed, she wouldn’t be able to assist!  
"Peace, why isn't Clara running yet? Aren't we in danger?"  
"She has her reasons! She told us to leave first, assuring she could handle it!"  
Although he knew the whole world couldn’t withstand it, Clara might not have a way either, but they were powerless… they could only hope she would be alright.  
"Alright then..."

Adjusting Grandma Hu on his back, Guan Pei ran faster. They couldn’t create chaos for the base manager.  
At this moment, directly above the base, layers of sugar cane stacked upon one another to form a massive circular shield!

While Clara controlled the sugar cane shield, she asked,  
[Sisi, how long until the meteorite reaches us?]  
[About 2 minutes!]  
“That’s enough time! Sisi, help me pull all the container houses from storage!”  
Fortunately, she had stockpiled plenty in case of emergencies; little did she expect to use them so soon!  
[Alright, Lanlan!]

Though the system's building materials couldn’t directly repel meteorites, they had other uses!  
Beneath the sprawling shield, four white pillars "slowly rose!"  
Upon closer inspection, these were container towers!

The sugar cane shield gained the support of the container houses, significantly reducing her burden.  
[Sisi, can we predict where the meteorite will land?]  
[Yes, it should directly be above us.]  
"Good!"  
She focused on increasing the sugar cane's thickness, forming a shield that was thick in the center and thin around the edges.  
Whether it could withstand the impact would depend on fate!

[Countdown begins: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, ...]  
Clara gulped down a small bottle of energy-boosting liquid exchanged from StarNet; too bad it had no flavor!  
[Lanlan, this isn’t the time to think about that!]  
“Oh, my apologies!”  
[Target approaching! Get ready!]  
“Alright!”  

Simultaneously, it was said that the Sugar Cane Base was facing the largest meteorite currently hurtling toward Earth from outer space.  
The higher-ups in Hua Country urgently convened a meeting to view the live broadcast of Dr. Chang's research as they monitored the situation at the scene!  
Dr. Chang and his team felt anxious for the Sugar Cane Base.  
When the meteorite collided with the sugar cane shield, the tremendous impact made Clara's body tremble with the force of the blast!  
People who had run far away, those still sprinting, and everyone watching on-screen couldn’t help but feel tense for the Sugar Cane Base!
