**Efforts in Building**

Xiao Guan was quite the chatterbox, continuously sharing knowledge about the apocalypse with Lanlan Gan along the way. 

"Lanlan, you have no idea! We're actually among the lucky ones. I've seen online that some places are much worse off than us. I think it's better to be safe than sorry. You should stock up on supplies—better to be prepared, right?" 

"Yes, I think you’re right," Lanlan replied. 

"Right? Finally, someone who understands me! By the way, I’ve hoarded a ton of food at home, haha! Even if nothing happens, I can just sell it for some extra cash later!" 

So even he wasn’t completely convinced, huh? 

As they passed people along the road—some wailing, some feeling lucky, and others helping each other—it was clear that, at least for now, everyone was remaining positive. It was uncertain how chaotic the so-called 'chaos' would truly become. 

"Lanlan, are you sure you live around here? It’s quite secluded. Thankfully, this road is still passable; otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to deliver your stuff." 

"Yes, thank you, Xiao Guan. You've been a huge help." 

"No problem at all! My dad’s a retired soldier; he loves helping people out, haha!" 

Xiao Guan smirked proudly, while Lanlan smiled along, rolling her eyes at his boasting. 

Eventually, they stopped in front of a striking shipping container house, standing alone amid the ruins. 

Xiao Guan scratched his head, surprised that this girl lived in a shipping container. 

"I’m here! Thank you, Xiao Guan." 

"You're welcome! Let me help you carry some stuff; there’s quite a bit!" 

Looking at the piled-up cart, it was clear that moving everything alone wasn’t practical, so she accepted his offer. 

As Lanlan opened the container door, Xiao Guan gasped, "I can’t believe it! This little... um, house has fingerprint access!" 

"It’s not bad, right? It may be small, but it has everything I need. Let’s just get this stuff inside; I’ll organize it later." 

Once all the items were moved in, Lanlan sighed as she surveyed the increasingly crowded interior. 

She handed Xiao Guan a bottle of water, which he accepted while glancing around the tiny space, feeling somewhat envious. "Lanlan, this house of yours is pretty nice! It has everything; I really like it." 

"I think so too. This little nest is enough for me." 

"That's true... but I suggest you consider moving to town. It’s kind of chaotic out here, and there aren’t many people around. If something happens, you won’t be able to call for help." 

"Thanks, but I don’t want to move just yet. This area is fine for me." 

"All right then, I’m off! I have to get back to work with my dad. Contact me if you need anything." He fished out his phone and gestured for Lanlan to scan his contacts.

"Uh... sorry, I don’t have one," she said with an awkward smile. Along the way, she had seen numerous people scrolling through their phones, but Lanlan had realized she truly didn’t own one. 

"Okay, be careful, and if you need anything, feel free to find us!" 

Watching as Xiao Guan rode away on his tricycle, Lanlan asked, "Si Si, is the world outside really that chaotic now?" 

"Yes, Lanlan. We're actually quite safe here. But things are going to get worse in the future. No one can change the nature of the world’s retaliation." 

[**Task Three**] Completed. Reward: 10 energy points. Total energy: 20 points. 

Wow, great! No time for sentimentality; it's time to get back to work. 

However, after completing Task Two, she had only been able to update some furniture and didn’t have enough space for more items, so she hadn’t spent any energy on purchases. 

Fortunately, after completing a new task, a shopping mall interface appeared. 

Previously filled with furniture, it now included materials for building houses and even a small flower bed? 

[**Ding~ Basic construction tasks completed. Reward: 3 energy points. Total energy: 23 points.**] 

[**Currently ensuring basic survival, but for the construction of a human habitat, sustainable development is necessary. New tasks opened.**] 

[**Task 1**: Build a vegetable garden.  
**Task 2**: Build a storage room.  
**Task 3**: Expand one room.  

**Tasks can be completed in any order. Please work hard!**] 

She felt utterly speechless. 

"Ah, being the last one seems like I’m only here to carry bricks. Don’t think I didn’t see that the mall opened up with a bunch of large items—a big farm, a big storage... this whole mall is open to all warriors, so the ones at the bottom are only fit for building." 

"[**Lanlan, let’s work hard to carry bricks, and in the future, we can buy a big manor and a big storage!**]” 

“...Yes, let me eat first before I go back to brick carrying.” 

"[**Yes! Go for it, Si Si loves you the most!**]"

“...” 

Although she didn’t quite understand how this house was built, the faucets provided a steady supply of cold and hot water, and it was designed to withstand earthquakes and floods—something that defied logic. 

Lanlan thought about it and decided it was best to focus on carrying bricks! 

Checking the material prices, everything seemed to cover a space of ten square meters. Building a room cost six points; a small flower bed cost two points and needed a transparent glass roof for light, which cost another two points. 

She decided to put the storage right behind the house—hoping it could connect so her items could be easily moved over. She would also build a right-side transparent-roofed room and cover it with a flower bed, transforming it into a small vegetable garden. 

As for the house, "Si Si, can I build the second story? And can I change the door's position?" 

"Absolutely! Our building materials can be stacked. Just flip a page; you’ll see houses with stairs—once you install the stairs, you can continue building upstairs. You can also choose where to place the door." 

It really was like building with blocks—though it was no small task since she was just one laborer. 

[**Storage Room Material Exchange: 5 points (1 roof + 1 floor + 3 walls)**]  
[**Second Story Room Material Exchange: 6 points (1 roof + 4 walls + 1 stair)**]  
[**Small Yard Material Exchange: 8 points (2 roofs + 1 floor + 3 walls + 2 land)**] 

Looking at the remaining four points, it seemed best not to think about the extra costs of five points for automatic installation. Sure enough, those at the bottom could only work for their bricks!
