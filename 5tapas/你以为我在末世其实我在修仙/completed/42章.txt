My name is David Wei.

On the arena, two figures, one in black and the other in purple, stood facing each other, sizing each other up and assessing their fighting abilities. 

However, the audience below thought both contestants were weaklings: one was so nervous he could barely stand, and the other was too small—there wasn’t much to see! 

Yet, none of that affected the match on stage. The man clasped his fists and introduced himself: 
“I am a new disciple of the Sword Sect, Adam Xiao!” 
Finally shedding the pink garments arranged by his senior sister, the now-purple-clad Clara Gan boldly announced, “I am Clara Gan, a new disciple of the Lianshan Sect!” 

And then, they just stared at each other in a standoff. Observing the tall, seemingly anxious competitor, Clara thought: 
After all, I’ve fought countless zombies in my dreams, so this little matchup doesn’t faze me at all! The more nervous he seemed, the stronger she felt! 

Yet, seeing that the opponent had no intention of making a move, Clara realized they couldn't just remain locked in a stalemate! 
So, she manifested a sugarcane in her hand and raised it high! 

The opponent, perhaps thinking it was time for his junior sister to reveal her weapon, promptly drew his sword! 
And then… neither of them made a move! 

“Master, why are they stopping again?” 
Even the spectators on the sidelines were buzzing: 
“Looks like another pair of timid newcomers that don’t even dare to strike. Good luck surviving in the cultivation world…” 

Before they could finish their chatter, a loud “bang!” echoed; Adam Xiao was sent flying off the stage! 
“Did… did Clara just win?” 
Lin Yu, seemingly not believing his own eyes, rubbed them and excitedly turned to share with the masters: “Clara won!” 
“Sit down, you’re making a scene!” 
Master Qingyang stroked his beautiful beard: “I have my own eyes!” 
Master Wenggu's previously tightly clasped fan now swayed elegantly! 
Wengzhi also relaxed his grip on his handkerchief: 
“Clara has always been so straightforward.” 

Didn’t they see Adam Xiao sprawled on the ground, completely dazed, unable to believe that a mere sugarcane had knocked him out?

“Are you alright, senior brother from the Sword Sect?” 
Since he appeared to be older than her, calling him senior brother should be correct! 
Adam finally responded to Clara’s voice: “I’m fine.” 
Even though he saw the junior sister wield her purple sugarcane, he immediately went to block her blow. 
He just hadn’t anticipated: with one strike! Just one strike, and he was out of the match! 
Though they were all new disciples, he felt like the force of that blow was far superior to his own! 

“Junior sister, you’re really strong!” 
“Um, not really! Are you hurt, senior brother?” After all, she was used to fighting zombies like this!
“No injuries! Junior sister wins, I admit defeat!” 
“Thank you, senior brother!” 

The spectators glanced at the match, merely thinking the girl possessed great strength. 
After all, this was just the preliminary round; it was all just newcomers participating! There wasn’t much to see, and the real highlights were yet to come! 
So, in the absence of concern, Clara continued winning three straight matches in the same manner, directly advancing to a stronger group. 

Clara understood it this way: 
She had passed the preliminary rounds and now qualified to enter a higher tier. 
After all, it was said that the disciples eligible to participate in the newbie competition were already strong; a hundred new disciples were selected from various sects, and only ten could face stronger opponents.
Each year, one or two particularly outstanding new entrants might manage to win two matches, but by the final match, no new disciples had ever made it in. 
However, this time, who knows! Master Qingyang thought to himself. 
After that, Clara wouldn’t have much involvement anymore! 

When it was time for her senior brothers and sisters to compete, Clara finally witnessed a spectacular display of magical dueling! 
Compared to the newbie matches, it was like a brawl versus a fantastical martial arts film. 
Look at the eldest senior brother, gracefully wielding a folding fan, effortlessly dispatching his opponent in less than three seconds with a musical attack from an ancient zither.
Then, Clara looked at her senior sister, who wielded a beautiful pink crystal sword, weaving stunning patterns in the air, creating waves of plum blossom light—her opponent must have been mesmerized! 
And lastly, there was her little senior brother, who usually seemed aloof but displayed extraordinary swordsmanship! He was truly from a sword-cultivating family; there was no doubt that ordinary folks were no match for him.

“Master, we all advanced!” 
Lin Yu smiled so widely that his teeth were almost visible, clearly in high spirits. 
“Hmm, good!” 
Master Qingyang felt that this time, their Lianshan Sect would finally shine in the limelight. 

*
“Lianshan Sect, Wengzhi, wins!” 
“Sword Sect… wins!” 
“Lianshan Sect, Wenggu, wins!” 
“Alchemist Sect… wins!” 
“Artifact Sect… wins!” 
“Lianshan Sect, Lin Yu, wins!” 
“Beast Master Sect… wins!” 
“Lianshan Sect, Clara Gan, wins!” 

To keep up appearances, she deliberately reported one less name! After all, no one was paying attention; otherwise, there wouldn’t be such a blunder about “going out for a meal.” 
The spectators were discussing this year’s matches: 
“It seems this year, Lianshan Sect has produced a super strong girl. I heard she’s a new disciple, but she wields that stick like a tiger, knocking all her opponents off the stage.” 
“Yeah, yeah! I was fortunate enough to see it; it felt like she didn’t even use any spells to win. I specifically came to watch her play this time!” 
“Brother, same here, same here!” 
“Look over there! That’s the strong girl!” 
“Where? I want to see!” 
“That little fairy in the purple dress, the smallest one!” 
“That’s her! That’s her!” 

Clara had already gone on a winning streak in several matches; it seemed that with her sugarcane, no one could stand against her. 
Today was another match, but before stepping on stage: 
“Why do I feel like everyone is watching us?” 
As Wenggu, who knew what was being said outside but didn’t want the junior sister to hear, replied: 
“It’s nothing; just focus on your match, junior sister.” 
“Oh, I’ll listen to my eldest senior brother.” 

Lin Yu tugged at his eldest brother’s sleeve, as everyone outside was calling the little junior sister a “strong girl”—he’d battled several matches against people before. Eldest brother, how can you tolerate this?
Wenggu shrugged him off: 
“Sit tight and watch the match!” 
“Oh!” 

Feeling wronged! Eldest brother wasn’t reliable. At worst, he’d team up with Haozi later to help the junior sister get revenge. 
For now, he made sure to remember those faces! Hmph! 

In this match, the opponent was a massive, muscular fighter who scratched his head in a naïve manner upon seeing Clara: 
“I know you! I watched your matches!” 
Among the contenders, Clara was among the youngest; everyone called her junior sister, so this must be the customs of the cultivation world. 
“Your strength is impressive! But I’m no slouch either; let’s have a good match!” 
“Um, my strength isn’t that great! Just… a little bit!” 
“Hahaha, I won’t hold back; I’m the hope of my whole village. I must make the top ten to join the sect!” 
“Well then, senior brother, please go first!” 
“Since you’re a girl, you can go first.” 

This time, formality was unnecessary. Holding out her right hand, she conjured the sugarcane staff! 
I have to say, it kept getting sturdier as she fought; it must be stronger than diamonds! 
Taking off with a run, she jumped, sweeping horizontally! 
The big guy was pushed back to the edge of the stage, muscles tensed as he fought to hold his ground. 

Clara came down with another strike! 
The big guy blocked it, but he could taste blood in his mouth; he wouldn’t give up! 
Another hit! 
Swallowing blood, the brute continued to block! 
… 
Until finally, the giant fell, bloodied and unable to rise! 
“By the way, may I ask your name, senior brother?” 
She admired such a robust warrior. 
After all, in the previous matches, Clara’s cane strikes had barely been resisted. 
Even if someone dodged using spells, they’d be caught by the sugarcane afterward, then knocked out of the match! 
You could say the matches were practically decided with one decisive blow. 

But this person was different; he exhibited no signs of cultivation and relied solely on his physical prowess to defend himself. He was truly impressive! 
“My name is… Wei… Bao Cun!”
