**Meteor Attack**

The impact of the meteorite ignited a massive burst of sparks, tugging at everyone's hearts!

Seeing that Guan Xin was about to rush back, Hua Jue quickly grabbed him.

"Guan Xin, what are you doing?"

"Hua, let go of me! Lan is still back there!"

"You going back won't help! With that force, you'd be lucky to survive for a second."

"Let go!"

"Trust her!"

As the most intense impact approached, the ever-growing sugarcane was doing its best to fend off the meteorite!

Though the naturally resilient sugarcane could weaken the meteorite's power, it was still far from enough!

Guan Lanlan raised her left hand high, urging the sugarcane to grow, trying to cushion the meteorite's fall. Her right hand seemed to be straining as it clenched into a fist.

The sugarcane that had scattered around, previously unaffected by the impact, began to converge toward the meteorite.

At that moment, they were thankful for the previous preparations; otherwise, they wouldn’t have enough time even to activate the sugarcane!

However, no matter how they reasoned, the meteorite was far too powerful…

The sugarcane shield transformed from a “conical” shape into a “funnel,” yet it still couldn’t slow down the meteorite's descent.

Guan Lanlan's face dripped with sweat as Si Si paced nervously in the star network.

[Lanlan, just let it go! The base is gone; we can rebuild, but you must not get hurt!]

Guan Lanlan understood this well. 

But starting over would not be simpler than stopping the meteorite!

She couldn't just watch as the home everyone had tirelessly built vanished just like that. Once destroyed, all the network routes would collapse… everything would be in vain!

After finally getting used to the chaos of life, she now faced the impending destruction of her family and home once again!

No, she couldn't! If she alone could withstand it, she was willing to pay any price.

She closed her eyes and quickly downed a bottle of potential-enhancing liquid.

All she could do now was hope that the powerful energy liquid she bought at a high price from the star network would give her another chance to fight!

People watched as the meteorite, which had slowed in its descent, was slowly pushed back up by the surging sugarcane.

The onlookers couldn't help but clench their fists in tandem with the rise and fall of the sugarcane.

Captain Hua's expression darkened as he saw the message from Dr. Zhong.

"Captain, where are you going? It's dangerous over there; Lanlan said for everyone to stay away!"

However, Captain Hua and the ever-persistent Guan Xin charged back toward the base without looking back.

Seeing their determined figures, they exchanged glances.

"Shouldn’t we go help? We can't let Lanlan handle this alone."

"I agree; I want to help Lanlan too."

"Alright, let’s give it our all! md, we can't go on like this!"

"Let’s go!"

"I'm going too!"

"Yes, we’re all going!"

At the headquarters in Hua Country, everyone watched the livestream, noticing how the sugarcane was visibly stabilizing the meteorite.

Just as they let out a sigh of relief, they saw the meteorite slowly falling again, and the relief was quickly replaced with anxiety!

Meanwhile, Guan Lanlan, feeling exhausted after two rounds of power exertion, could clearly sense her limits.

Her arms stayed elevated in a supporting position, but they were already numb!

Yet she knew she couldn’t let her guard down!

Because behind her were countless lives!

Just hold on a little longer, just a little longer...

Suddenly, the previously dim sky, shrouded by the sugarcane, erupted with vibrant colors!

[Si Si, what’s happening?]

[Lanlan, it’s the power users from the base!]

Those colorful lights were from energy spheres of different abilities:

Blue water energy relentlessly struck the meteorite;

White frost tried to envelop it;

Golden blades attempted to slice it apart, a move typical of Uncle Guan;

Ice-blue lightning cracked open a fissure in the meteorite, clearly the handiwork of Captain Hua;

Moreover, even the shipping container pillars were wrapped in numerous plant vines for added stability…

Other forces manifested in a spectrum of colors and forms!

Everyone shared a common goal: 

"Let’s fight!"

But ultimately, the effort felt futile, as everyone struggled against the meteorite!

They could all sense that many of the energy attacks were in vain!

Dr. Zhong had previously warned that this might not just be a single meteorite; its sudden appearance posed unimaginable dangers!

Feeling this earth-shattering power, if it landed directly on the base, they could only imagine the horrendous consequences!

Meanwhile, Guan Lanlan remained strong and had held off the most powerful impacts for so long, showcasing her incredible resilience.

*

As more and more people joined the fray, Guan Lanlan couldn’t help but smirk.

She had never been fighting alone, had she?

Although many had come to support, most were contributing little!

She knew this wouldn’t hold up much longer; she had to think of another strategy!

Gradually, some folks were losing strength, and the attacks in the air started to wane— the meteorite began its slow descent.

[Lanlan, monitoring indicates that the meteorite's force has been sufficiently mitigated; natural resilience should suffice now.]

[Okay, I understand!]

Guan Lanlan took a moment to drink her last bottle of energy liquid.

[Si Si, help me amplify my voice!]

[Sure!]

Suddenly, Guan Lanlan's voice echoed throughout the base: 

"Everyone, thank you for your hard work. Please evacuate to a safe distance."

Even though they knew their Base Leader couldn’t hear them, they still shouted, "No, we won't leave!"

"Base Leader, we won’t abandon you!"

As if sensing their words, Guan Lanlan's voice resonated again:

"It’s alright, I have a plan now. I need you all out of my way."

Captain Hua looked at the sweat-soaked Lanlan and the power users collapsed on the ground, choosing to trust her.

"We'll retreat first."

"Captain..."

"That’s an order!"

"Captain... yes."

"Guan Xin, let’s go!"

"I’m not leaving! If anyone goes, it should be you!"

"Staying here will just hinder her! Besides, even if we are here… we truly can’t help much."

Guan Xin pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before reluctantly following.

Si Si relayed the news of their evacuation, and Guan Lanlan finally felt relieved.

[That's good! Now it's my turn!]
