**Chapter 1: A Heartfelt Proposal**

"I am fond of you; will you marry me?"

"We... we acknowledge!"

The Celestial Lord of Nan Hua nodded, "Acknowledging is good!"

With a snap of his fingers, a beam of light shot out, instantly whisking away the Emperor of Yamato, the underworld, and the remaining soldiers, teleporting them back to their homeland! The Celestial Lord of Nan Hua expressed that he no longer wished to hear their nonsensical chatter.

After closing his eyes, he gently tapped his forehead with his slender fingers. A purple light shot upward, heading toward the Yamato Kingdom!

Before long, it felt like it was raining people from the sky, raising a cloud of dust and the air filled with their horrified screams of "Ahhhh!"

Fortunately, the people of the Celestial Realm seemed to have a barrier protecting them from being covered in dust.

As the dust settled, a group of people was seen kneeling on the ground. Their attire indicated that they were Yamato people!

They were all kneeling in one direction, which seemed to face South City?!

These individuals, most of whom were about the same age as the village chief of Da Yong, seemed to be in good spirits compared to the villagers of Gan Zhe Village, indicating they were living quite well!

The forcibly kneeling Yamato individuals had been peacefully sleeping at home, but with the flash of purple light, they found themselves in this unfamiliar place!

They wanted to scream, to question who had captured them, but realized they could not produce any sound!

They wanted to struggle and resist, but their knees felt like they were glued to the ground, unable to move!

However, did anyone care about their thoughts? Just like how they had never cared about the thoughts of the people of South City when it mattered.

With his finger lightly tapping on the armrest, the Celestial Lord of Nan Hua inquired, “Fu Hua, is it?”

Fu Hua, the Daoist, hastily stepped forward, "Yes, my lord! What can I do for you?"

"These are the sinners who participated in the massacre of South City back in the day."

These were all the individuals that the Celestial Lord of Nan Hua had identified through his recently executed "Time Rewind" technique, and he had brought them here!

Fu Hua was astonished; such a cross-time ability, such precise tracking—who besides the Celestial Lord of Nan Hua could accomplish this?! 

He couldn't contain his excitement and shouted, "Celestial Lord's might!"

The crowd behind him instinctively joined in with shouts of, "Celestial Lord’s might! Celestial Lord’s might! Celestial Lord’s might!…"

With a raised hand, the Celestial Lord silenced the room as if the sound had been muted, aside from the wind!

"Leave none of these people alive!"

The people behind him shouted in unison, their voices shaking the heavens!

"Yes! Not a single one shall remain!!"

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

The rage that surged from the massacre of South City had already ignited a wildfire within the Celestial Realm. It was like tossing a match onto dry grass, enough to set them ablaze!

Hearing the order, they could no longer restrain their fury and charged out!

Thus began a one-sided slaughter that would conclude with revenge!

*

Watching the scene where countless enemies were annihilated in an instant left Gan Lanlan in a daze for a long time. 

[Lanlan, could it really be him?]

Si Si's incessant questions jolted Gan Lanlan back, but her uncertainty showed through as she replied, [It should be, right?]

[But] Si Si, reluctant to admit it, had to concede, [He is truly powerful!]

[... After all, he is the founder of the Lan Mountain Sect!]

[Then will he be like the apocalypse again?]

[Don’t worry, given his attitude now, he’s definitely on our side! With such a powerful backing, we can rest easy. From now on, let’s just enjoy a peaceful retirement on Wanzhi Mountain!]

Upon hearing this, Si Si nodded eagerly!

She excitedly jumped up, forgetting this wasn’t a virtual forum, nearly losing her balance.

Fortunately, Gan Lanlan caught her in time.

[Si Si, be careful.]

[You scared me! Thanks, Lanlan!]

As she rubbed Gan Lanlan's hand affectionately, Gan Lanlan couldn’t help but smile at Si Si’s cuteness!

Recalling their earlier topic, Si Si’s large, expressive eyes looked up at her:

[Lanlan, does that mean we can... um, what’s that person said, "lie flat"?]

Gan Lanlan couldn't help but laugh out loud.

She lightly tapped Si Si's small nose and replied, [Yes, we can lie flat from now on.]

[Then, can Si Si eat as much sugarcane as she wants?]

[Of course! If there's not enough, you can eat how much you want, and I’ll plant more!]

[Then, can Si Si have delicious soup dumplings every morning?]

[Yes, as long as you don’t get tired of them!]

[Then, can Si Si have afternoon tea and caramel milk tea?]

[Sure, and I can even add a slice of cake for you.]

[Then, can Si Si stay with Lanlan forever?]

Gan Lanlan paused, looking into Si Si's earnest eyes. From the apocalypse to now, Si Si had always cared solely about her!

Feeling touched, she leaned down to kiss Si Si's fluffy little head:

[Of course. We will always be together.]

[Argh, then Si Si also wants to enjoy retirement! Si Si loves retirement!]

"Alright, we’ll retire together!"

"Instead of retiring with this little beast, how about retiring with me?"

With a serious face, holding Si Si, she turned to face the unexpected guest in the room.

"What's this? Now that we’re not in the apocalypse, you don't even knock?"

Nan Hua hadn’t expected his reunion with his old acquaintance to be anything like he imagined:

"Uh... Sorry, should I start over?"

"Ha!" 

Caught between a laugh and retreat, the Celestial Lord was at a loss.

"I've already come in; shall we sit and chat?"

His tone softened, and the Celestial Lord swiftly made his way to a chair and sat down!

He was afraid that if he hesitated for even a moment, someone would throw him out.

For some reason, even though he'd faced great storms in the past, he felt a bit nervous now.

Feeling the heated gaze from across the table, he found he couldn’t fathom her thoughts, and the atmosphere fell into silence.

Gan Lanlan, with her head down, gently stroked Si Si, spoke calmly:

"Whatever you have to say, just say it directly!"

Nan Hua seemed to finally have made a decision; taking a deep breath, he declared:

"I have feelings for you!"

Startled, Gan Lanlan froze, her hand that had been petting Si Si momentarily halted!

Si Si, who had been drowsy, immediately perked up, "What... What did you say? I didn’t hear clearly!"

Isn't this the moment for introductions and sharing their experiences? Why the sudden confession?

"I said, I have feelings for you! Will you marry me?"

Gan Lanlan stared in shock, hoping to find "just joking" written on his face.

Unfortunately, his expression was unusually serious, with a hint of nervousness.

"Um..."

"Don't speak yet! Let me finish!"

Perhaps it was the rush of finally speaking that made his following sentences flow more easily.

"Our first encounter was during the apocalypse trials. You seemed so special in my eyes back then."

"Later, we built and expanded the sugarcane base together, fought zombies, and faced meteors... Until you left, I realized..."

He looked straight into Gan Lanlan's eyes, "I like you."

"Unfortunately, it was too late by then!"

"You entrusted the sugarcane base to me; it became my responsibility until my death. Of course, I managed it well, and the sugarcane base was unique even during the apocalypse!"

"But I could never smile again! Because you took away all my laughter."

Gan Lanlan couldn’t help but ask, "Did you die over there as well?"

"Yes! But don't worry, I died naturally." Not from exhaustion!

Gan Lanlan replied, "Oh."

"When I woke up in the vine sphere and saw the familiar sugarcane, when I confirmed it was yours, do you know how excited I was?"

"Regrettably, you didn’t recognize me."

Gan Lanlan said, "Do you know how different you look now from how you were in the apocalypse?"

Nan Hua couldn’t help but grab Gan Lanlan’s hand excitedly:

"You recognize me, don’t you? You know who I am, right?"

Trying to retract her hand was futile as he held on too tightly.

She had to use her free hand to pull out a note and pushed it towards him.

"Your hint is pretty obvious!"

It was the note from the box, which contained just four characters:

[Hua Jiao Guan Xin]

"Team Hua..."

Hearing those two words dimmed the light in Nan Hua's eyes!
