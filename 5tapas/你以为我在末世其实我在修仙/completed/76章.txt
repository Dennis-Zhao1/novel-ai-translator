**Chapter 1: The Breach of the Barrier**

Recently, the cultivation world has been anything but peaceful.

"Report! A group of disciples from the Lanshan Sect has brought some commoners seeking refuge. They say the north has been overrun by broom-riding sorcerers and soul-eating monsters; there are no living souls left."

"Report! In the south, there's been an outbreak of Western dragons; towns have been burned to the ground, and they are asking for help."

"Report! In the east, a hundred ghosts are rampaging, armed with strange firearms, and have captured coastal towns. They are here seeking assistance."

"Report! In the west, packs of wolfmen are prowling, alongside demons that feast on human blood. It is rumored that even celestial masters, if bitten, will become dry corpses. They urgently request help from the Lanshan Sect."

"Report! ..."

"Report! ..."

This time, the Heavenly Emperor, the Cultivation Alliance, the Lanshan Sect, and even a few rogue cultivators gathered in a rush. The Western attack had come too swiftly and unexpectedly.

They had even disregarded international agreements, using the Japanese as an excuse to directly assault the cultivation realm.

"What are we to do?"

"I ask you, Master Xuanqing, is Master Nanhua of the Lanshan Sect present? If he were here, these people would not dare act so arrogantly!"

Master Xuanqing sighed, "We do not know where the Master is either!"

He glanced discreetly at his junior brother Qingyang. The Master had sent word that he would take Qingyang's little disciple to the secret realm for training and told them to manage things themselves!

He had thought it would just be a small matter with the Japanese; they had always played petty games and posed no real threat!

Unexpectedly, this situation had escalated far too much!

The "cultivators" from the Western world were not to be underestimated, easily catching them off guard.

Especially since they had large ships, laser cannons, and thunder rifles—seemingly designed specifically to combat their world. Those who fell into their sights had no hope of survival.

Furthermore, they showed no regard for the difference between mortals and immortals, launching indiscriminate attacks, as if they aimed to annihilate the entire race.

In just three days, most of the Eastern continent had fallen, but thanks to Master Nanhua's protective barrier, the Lanshan Sect remained relatively safe.

"What are we to do?"

"I only hope the Master returns soon! But before he does, we cannot simply wait; we must think of countermeasures."

A rogue cultivator from the Alliance scoffed, "How easy it is for you from the Lanshan Sect to speak. You have your barriers protecting you; as long as you stay within the sect, you need not worry. We poor rogues do not share that fortune!"

A heavenly envoy chimed in, "Indeed, the Western demon tribe has put in great effort to deal with us. We've never seen such monsters before; how are we to respond? What to do indeed?"

"Report, a group of Western demons is at the Lanshan Sect's gates, declaring..."

"What are they declaring?"

"They demand that Master Nanhua step out, and... they say the Master is a coward who dares not engage them in battle."

"Shameless."

"I'll take care of them myself."

Seeing Qingyang speak up, Master Xuanqing earnestly advised, "Junior brother, do not act out of impulsive emotion!"

While others pointed fingers at the Lanshan Sect, they had already sent out all their capable disciples for battle. The Alliance and the Heavenly Court still possessed strength; it made no sense to send those of them who were less adept in combat.

"Brother Master, everyone here is simply lamenting that the Lanshan Sect's handling of Gan Sugar Village has brought about today's disaster. For both emotional and logical reasons, our Wanzhi Mountain should step forward."

"Junior brother, you must not say that. The Western demon tribe has long coveted us; this is merely a pretext. Moreover, there are only you and Yu'er left at Wanzhi Mountain; how can you face them?"

"My mind is made up; brother, no need for further persuasion."

Master Xuanqing watched as Qingyang took Lin Yu with determination, not looking back. "This... this... sigh!"

"Master, are we really going to face them?" Lin Yu asked.

"Of course. We must uphold the Lanshan Sect's honor! Go, we should prepare."

"Yes, Master."

Though they planned to face the enemy, there was no discussion on timing; as of now, they could not be breached. Even if the demons managed to enter, they would quickly be obliterated by the righteous flames.

"Your little junior sister has such foresight; there's enough sugarcane here to quench their thirst."

As it turned out, Gan Lianlian was afraid something would go wrong in her absence, so she had left behind a stash of secret weapons!

Looking at the familiar Wanzhi Mountain, Wen Gu couldn't help but muse, "It's been five hundred years; we are finally out!”

Wen Zhi used his spiritual awareness to probe around. "Indeed, we are finally free! But why is there no one on the mountain?"

Gan Lianlian, holding onto Si Si, also glanced around. "Hmm? It's understandable that the Master and Junior Brother are not here, but where are the people from Gan Sugar Village?"

Master Nanhua, holding Gan Lianlian's hand, casually replied, "They are all at the gates of the Lanshan Sect."

"Then let’s hurry there!"

The four of them—Wen Gu, Wen Zhi, Gan Lianlian, and Master Nanhua—had just entered the "Time Mirror". Although they hadn’t entered the realm at the same time, they had all come out together.

Wen Gu and Wen Zhi had previously cultivated in different locations, before they were suggested by Gan Lianlian to practice together.

Now, the cultivation levels of the three siblings could not be compared to their former selves.

Moreover, as they looked at the tightly held hands, despite having witnessed it for hundreds of years, they couldn't help but feel a sweet sense of indulgence.

Master Nanhua had indeed put in tremendous effort; in the "Time Mirror," he was ostensibly training but was genuinely engaged in a romantic endeavor!

Wen Gu glanced at the battle scene at the gates of the Lanshan Sect. "Let's go! The Western demon tribe is quite audacious, directly attacking the gates of the Lanshan Sect. If we don’t leave now, we might not be able to hold them off."

"Let’s move!"

---

The soul-eating monsters were relentlessly attacking the Lanshan Sect's barrier, threatening to breach it at any moment.

Wolfmen were battling in the once dense sugarcane forest outside the gate, which had been reduced to mere patches after a day of fighting.

A row of cannons stood lined up, continuously bombarding a gap in the barrier, but instead of bombs, they were launching magically infused stones—this was the greatest threat to the barrier!

In the back, several dragons appeared to recuperate, ready to assault at any moment.

Further behind, a dark mass loomed, rendering it impossible to discern what lay within, but it radiated an ominous presence; it surely wasn't anything good.

Inside the barrier, disciples of the Lanshan Sect, celestial beings from the Heavenly Court, rogue cultivators, and even demon cultivators were all focused on the spot under attack.

The entire cultivation world had fallen into ruin; only the Lanshan Sect remained untouched due to the Master's barrier.

If it weren’t for meticulous planning, no one would believe that the entire celestial realm could fall into the hands of the Western demon tribe in just a few short days!

"Master, let us out! This matter began with us, let us end it! After all, we are all of a certain age now!"

Injuries covered Lin Yu's body, yet he still persisted in his resolve.

"No! You are all victims, you are not to be implicated in this!"

Master Qingyang, covered in soot, showed the dire situation of the battle. "There’s no need for such drastic measures! Whether you go or stay, it will make no meaningful difference; the Western demon tribe has harbored ambitions for years. This is merely an excuse for their long-planned invasion. If you go out now, it will only result in needless casualties."

With a resounding "boom," all attention was drawn!

"Not good! The barrier set by the Master has been breached!"
