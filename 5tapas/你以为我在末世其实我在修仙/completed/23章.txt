**Surrounding Circumstances**

A year’s time can feel neither long nor short. Zombies and mutated species have become increasingly difficult to handle, but humanity continues to make progress.

In the Huaguo, as resources are being redirected to safer areas, the military, scientific research, and economy are slowly beginning to recover, and the Sugarcane Base is gradually expanding as well.

From an aerial view, the ground resembles a giant spider web, with the Sugarcane Base at its center. The intersection points of this web are bases constructed or renovated using materials provided by Lanlan Gan.

Now, Lanlan can occasionally go on “a little trip,” but only along established routes. After all, she once strayed outside the base area, almost triggering a zombie outbreak.

Across the globe, people also live primarily in bases, with the M Country base being the most well-known. It seems they had ample preparation from the moment the apocalypse struck and are leading far ahead of other countries in safety and technology.

They retain traditional genes, using their resources as bait to continuously annex smaller nations nearby. If not for the frequent natural disasters and the enormous risk of crossing seas, they might even attempt to conquer nations across the ocean.

However, given the current situation, they don't seem to have given up on their dream of world domination!

The one who matters most to Lanlan is Wells, the leader of the M Country base. Based on current information, his extraordinary strength and the insights she gathered from the main system suggest that he is likely one of the warriors defending their homeland.

The world is also keenly observing his movements. No flies would gather around a seamless egg, especially a golden dragon egg. Despite their formidable power, having so many flies can be bothersome.

In due time, when the dragon egg is completely riddled with flies, will it exude a foul stench after assimilation? Or will it cause a drastic blow to themselves while killing a thousand enemies? No one knows for sure.

Besides this, there seems to be a special figure within the Huaguo military—Doctor Zhong. It is said he was abroad before the apocalypse but bravely returned, disregarding the hardships and dangers wrought by the new world.

All the way, he helped the weak establish temporary shelters, and only after reuniting with senior officials did he fully commit to scientific research, helping the nation establish a robust military system that elevated the overall national strength.

Doctor Zhong’s return made the skeptics from the outside listen in awe, particularly when, during a large-scale zombie wave, Huaguo successfully annihilated the horde using the latest weaponry he helped develop. 

At that moment, Huaguo was uplifted, and the world was left astonished.

Lanlan, due to her unique materials, had a friendly conversation with Doctor Zhong. He was tall and thin, wore glasses, and spoke calmly, leaving a very favorable impression.

However, when parting, Doctor Zhong patted Lanlan on the shoulder, saying, “You’re a good kid. Focus on infrastructure and serious farming—it's more important than anything else. Huaguo’s future relies on you younger folks. Don’t worry about other matters; I’ll take the lead!”

His eyes seemed to see through everything, filled with encouragement as he smiled at her. It felt as if they both recognized each other's identities but chose not to bring it to light.

He seemed to say, “I’ll handle the front lines; you just need to stay low and build your career, and no one will notice you.”

“Doctor Zhong…”

“You’re doing great. No need to worry. In case of emergencies, feel free to contact me directly. This is my personal communicator; there are only a few around, so take it!”

“This… Maybe leave this for someone in greater need?”

“There's no one more deserving than you!”

Looking at the warm expression of the doctor, in that moment, Lanlan’s anxious heart completely relaxed. 

A wave of warmth surged through her, making her jump up without regard for her image. She didn’t dare to act overly familiar with Doctor Zhong but instead gave a heartfelt and joyous hug to Captain Hua, who had been looking after her, leaving him quite rigid for a moment.

“Thank you, Doctor! I’ll definitely work hard for the people!”

“Hahaha, that’s great! But try to stay low-key; the situation is severe, and there are numerous hidden dangers. I’ve helped manage the information regarding the Sugarcane Base. Plant and farm well, don’t let others sway your original intentions.”

“Got it, thank you, Doctor.”

For Huaguo, especially for Lanlan, the best situation is to go unnoticed. Quietly achieving great things and seeking development is indeed the best way to ensure survival.

As a peace-loving nation, Huaguo has consistently adhered to the principle of “neither provoking others nor allowing others to provoke us.”

On the other hand, R Country, envious of Huaguo’s rapid progress and faced with natural disasters and limited resources due to its small territory, has looked back to the “glorious deeds” of their ancestors, starting to formulate plans and seek allies to strategize against Huaguo.

Unfortunately, their avoidance of historical issues has made it difficult for them to gain Huaguo’s trust. Still, when it comes to resources, Huaguo has displayed the grace of a major power: 

“We never abandon those in need, but we can’t easily forgive your past transgressions. If you want resources now, we require an equal exchange! If you lack something to trade, that’s fine, as long as you acknowledge your ‘historical mistakes’ and allow your citizens to work with us for construction, we’ll distribute the work fairly.”

Didn’t you say we haven’t shared our nation’s secrets? Sorry, our secret is hard work to build a peaceful home; if you don’t believe it, that’s not my fault.

Amidst chaos, to maintain a friendly relationship between the two countries, they provided a safe and reliable solution. How you choose is up to you.

After all, our people have always relied on their own hard work to earn their livelihood. There’s no reason you can just open your mouth and demand a piece of the pie.

Of course, if R Country wants to follow its ancestors' footsteps to steal from Huaguo, they’d better reevaluate their capabilities. It’s not that Huaguo looks down on them; it’s just that they are rich in resources and talents that cannot be simply pillaged or imitated!

As for seeking allies, their friends across the ocean in M Country are also hard-nosed folks who wouldn’t move without benefit. Even if they can respond to a call for help, they can’t cross the perilous distance to assist!

After all, they have limited resources themselves, and R Country has nothing worthy to offer in return, making it unworthy of M Country risking it.

In the end, R Country chose to “think it over."

Huaguo responded, “No worries, take your time. After all, it’s not us who are anxious!”
